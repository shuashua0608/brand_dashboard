Trump on Joe Rogan, MrBeast on Amazon Prime and rhode skin achieving $1B valuation. What is going on? These are not isolated cases, but the signals of a major cultural and commercial shift: In our 2025 Creator Brands Report at Vivaio Ventures we deep dive into how creators are disrupting the way people engage, decide, purchase and consume. Some highlights: Political Discourse: Donald Trump and Kamala Harris both appeared on major podcasts — an unprecedented move that reflects the rising relevance of creator-led platforms in shaping the political dialogue. Entertainment: MrBeast secured a $100M budget from Amazon Prime for his reality show Beast Games — creators are now shaping what prime-time looks like. Product consumption: 55% of Gen Z and Millennials rely on content creators for purchasing decisions (NCSolutions) — not ads, not influencers, but relatable, creator-driven content. Advertising: Social media advertising grew from $98B in 2019 to $244B in 2024 while in the same time span influencer marketing grew 4x (Statista, IMH). The message is clear: if you want to reach the next generation of consumers, you need to think creator-first.

tw_sl_b467e238e5adf01ff9b4050416abfd45,2025-07-01 08:10:08,ru,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[ru]Как выпускница Стэнфорда зарабатывает $100 млн в год на косметике для подростков Обеденный стол Кимберли Хо почти всегда завален. В любой день недели можно увидеть, как 35-летняя основательница и генеральный директор нью-йоркской компании по производству косметики для детей Evereden, рискуя испачкать белую мраморную поверхность, тестирует яркие помады в форме мелка и прочие продукты, предназначенные для поколения Альфа — людей, родившихся после 2010 года. «Сейчас у нас есть лаборатория с технологами и специалистами по исследованиям и разработкам, — говорит Кимберли, участница рейтинга Forbes «30 до 30» 2019 года. — Но я никогда не хотела отказываться от этой части работы, одержимость продуктом у меня в крови». С момента, когда она основала Evereden в 2018 году вместе с мужем, сотрудником Goldman Sachs Хуангом Ли, бренд ежегодно приносит $100 млн прибыли. Компания заняла нишу безопасных для детей и подростков средств по уходу за кожей. Среди первых клиентов Evereden много молодых мам, которые искали безопасные средства для чувствительной кожи младенцев. В период с 2018-го по 2021 год компания Evereden привлекла около $40 млн венчурного финансирования и, как и ее клиентская база, стала выросла, расширив ассортимент сыворотками для лица, кондиционерами для волос и парфюмерией, разработанными специально для детей, подростков и беременных. Хотя продукция компании представлена в Sephora в восьми странах за пределами США, включая Канаду, Австралию и Филиппины, большая часть ее доходов приходится на прямые продажи потребителям через Интернет. «Миллиарды долларов инвестиций были вложены в бьюти-продукты, косметику и уход за кожей женщин, но ни одна из этих инноваций и инвестиций не была направлена на уход за кожей для всей семьи, — говорит Кимберли. — Мне это несоответствие казалось бессмысленным». Согласно исследованию Ulta Beauty, проведенному в 2024 году, из-за социальных сетей поколение Альфа впервые узнает об уходовой косметике в среднем в восемь лет (для сравнения: у миллениалов и зумеров это происходило в 15 и 12 лет соответственно). Дан Су, аналитик Morningstar говорит: «Безусловно, юные потребители интересуются уходом за кожей и имеют доступ в интернет … и им может понадобится помощь в выборе правильного продукта. В противном случае они просто будут покупать продукцию, предназначенную для взрослых, что может не полностью удовлетворить их запросы». Он добавляет: «Самая интересная ниша, которая привлекает внимание компаний, инвесторов и бьюти-индустрии — дети в возрасте с восьми до 12 лет». Честный крем Кимберли Хо родилась и выросла в оживленной столице Малайзии Куала-Лумпуре, ее родители — предприниматели, у них своя типография. «Я была буквально «ребенком стартапа», в животе матери, которая таскала коробки, потому что не могла позволить себе никого нанять», — говорит она. В подростковом возрасте она была одержима идеей поступить в школу Лиги плюща, а позже решила подать документы в Стэнфорд, ориентируясь в основном на фотографии кампуса в солнечной Калифорнии на университетском сайте. «В первый раз я побывала в Америке, когда прилетела в Сан-Франциско, чтобы поступить в Стэнфорд», — вспоминает она. Кимберли Хо с чистой, гладкой кожей и игривой улыбкой выглядит как «Блондинка в законе», для которой нет ничего невозможного. Во время первого семестра на экономическом факультете Стэнфорда она смотрела, как ее однокурсники пытались понравиться представителям Goldman Sachs во время университетских «дней карьеры», а уже несколько лет спустя, в 2013 году, стала инвестиционным банкиром в элитной манхэттенской фирме. Еще через несколько лет перешла в компанию по управлению активами Oaktree. В Oaktree Хо работала с несколькими крупными косметическими брендами, и ее насторожили процессы, происходившие на рынке, — судебные иски на миллиарды долларов из-за утаивания рисков для здоровья, наплыв ничем не отличающихся друг от друга марок, проблемы с качеством продукции, которые постоянно замалчивались. Она вспоминает: «Я люблю сферу бьюти, у меня очень чувствительная кожа, и именно отсутствие заботы о потребителях и нечестность некоторых марок вызывали у меня дискомфорт. Момент просветления наступил, когда мои друзья уже создавали семьи и умоляли меня привезти домой в Малайзию баночки известных американских брендов, якобы «надежных и безопасных». Но я-то была инвестором этих брендов и знала, что не такие они надежные, как утверждают». Увидев этот вакуум в сегменте уходовой косметики премиум-сегмента, Хо в 2017 году ушла из Oaktree и запустила свою марку средств для всей семьи — так появился Evereden. 50 лучших дерматологов получили письма от Кимберли Хо с предложением помочь разработать составы для ее продукции. Доктор Джойс Тенг, заведующая отделением детской дерматологии в Стэнфордской медицинской школе, пригласила ее лично представить свою компанию. Концепция Кимберли ей сразу понравилась — у дочери Тенг тяжелая форма экземы. Вскоре Тенг заняла пост старшего научного сотрудника, а позже к ней присоединились еще двое врачей из Гарвардской медицинской школы. Косметические средства не нуждаются в одобрении от Управления по санитарному надзору за качеством пищевых продуктов и медикаментов (FDA), — но не солнцезащитный крем и мазь от экземы. Evereden получила одобрение на эти средства, а команда докторов в штате позволяет утверждать, что все средства в линейке «прошли клинические испытания». Клиенты растут, инвестиции тоже После первого раунда финансирования, проведенного техасской венчурной компанией Sidekick Partners в 2018 году, Evereden запустила линейку продуктов для младенцев. В 2019 году компания выпустила уходовую косметику для мам, которая включала масла для борьбы с растяжками. Преодолев отметку в $1 млн прибыли за первые несколько лет существования, компания начала добавлять в ассортимент средства для ухода за кожей и волосами для детей. «Мы расширили ассортимент по большей части потому, что наши покупатели говорили: «Эй, мой ребенок уже не младенец. И вообще, у меня еще есть старший. У вас есть что-нибудь для таких, как он?» , — говорит Кимберли Хо. Присутствие бренда в нескольких нишевых подкатегориях имеет первостепенное значение для роста, особенно на Amazon. За несколько месяцев после выхода на рынок продукция компании стала лидером в категории «Детские товары для волос» на Amazon — секторе, который был на этой гигантской площадке относительно неосвоенным. А самым быстрорастущим сегментом Evereden стала продукция для подростков. В 2021 году Evereden дважды привлекала инвестиции. По итогам раунда финансирования серии C компания получила $32 млн, список инвесторов возглавила GSR Ventures (Менло-Парк, Калифорния). Большая часть средств была направлена на создание собственной косметической лаборатории и набор команды технологов. «Это нетипично для бьюти-индустрии или уходовой косметики. Только у L'Oréal, Unilever and P&G есть собственные косметические лаборатории», — говорит Кимберли. Большая часть новых косметических брендов, включая проданную компании Elf Beauty за $1 млрд Rhode Beauty от Хейли Бибер, используют услуги сторонних косметических лабораторий и технологов, которые предлагают услуги по разработке формул, параллельно делая то же самое для десятков других компаний. В индустрии считается нормой тратить 18 месяцев на разработку нового продукта с привлечением сторонних компаний...."
mov_1A0F09DDD453A35BE55B0B2EE1DEB949,2025-07-01 08:14:00,pl,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pl]Paweł Rożyński Brian Chesky, który 17 lat temu założył rezerwacyjną platformę, określa obecny moment firmy jako „kryzys wieku średniego”. Twierdzi, że po okresie pandemii, która niemal zniszczyła firmę, Airbnb wyszło z kryzysu mocniejsze niż kiedykolwiek – zarówno finansowo, jak i technologicznie. Mimo to potrzebuje refleksji i zmian, jak dojrzały 40-latek, który „czuje się zagubiony i znów szuka sensu”. Jak Chesky przyznał w rozmowie z magazynem „Wired”, związane z marką doświadczenia użytkowników uległy pogorszeniu, a przychody nie rosną już tak szybko. Firma jest warta 83 mld dol., ale wciąż daleko jej pod tym względem do wiodących spółek technologicznych z tzw. wspaniałej siódemki. Airbnb i kryzys wieku średniego Brian Chesky od dawna zastanawiał się, jak wyrwać firmę z szufladki „wynajmu krótkoterminowego”. Uważał, że powinna się rozwijać jak Amazon, który zaczął jako księgarnia online, zanim stał się „sklepem ze wszystkim”. Zawsze coś jednak stawało na drodze – problemy z bezpieczeństwem, regulacje, globalna pandemia. Teraz wraca do tej idei. Pracuje bezpośrednio z zespołem, likwidując zbyt skomplikowane procesy, tropiąc błędy i nieintuicyjne funkcje. Szuka też inspiracji w postaci Steve'a Jobsa, który powrócił do Apple'a w czasach kryzysu firmy. – Steve Jobs jest dla mnie jak Michał Anioł albo da Vinci – powtarza, żałując, że nigdy nie spotkał Jobsa. Nowa usługa autonomicznych taksówek ma odwrócić spadkowy trend Tesli i zrewolucjonizować transpor... Na czym polegają zmiany w Airbnb? Ma być „platformą do wszystkiego”. Podczas gdy inne aplikacje zajmują się tylko jednym sektorem – dostawami jedzenia, naprawami domowymi, transportem – Chesky uznał, że doświadczenie Airbnb w prezentacji ofert, weryfikacji gospodarzy i reagowaniu na kryzysy, daje jej większe zaufanie użytkowników. A to klucz do tego, by stać się domyślnym wyborem do wszystkiego. Użytkownicy – dziś już 2 mld – mieliby otwierać aplikację nie tylko na wakacjach, ale także wtedy, gdy szukają fotografa portretowego, trenera personalnego czy kogoś, kto ugotuje im obiad. To na początek. W maju Airbnb wystartowało z pierwszym etapem transformacji, na którą wyda ponad 200 mln dol. Rozpoczęło współpracę z ponad 10 tys. usługodawców w 260 miastach w 30 krajach. Airbnb wprowadziło też dużą aktualizację aplikacji z uproszczonym interfejsem i funkcją „Guest Favorites”. Kolejny etap – bez konkretnej daty – ma sprawić, że profil w Airbnb stanie się „prawie jak paszport”. – Po prostu pomyśleliśmy, że to niesamowita okazja dla firmy, ponieważ jeśli chodzi o podróże, więcej osób zatrzymuje się w hotelach niż w domach. Jednym z głównych powodów, dla których lubią hotele, jest to, że jest tam wiele usług i wygód. Pomyśleliśmy: „Co by było, gdybyśmy mogli zapewnić wszystkie usługi w hotelu i więcej w domu?” – mówi Chesky. W efekcie Airbnb chce być czymś więcej niż tylko rezerwacją noclegu. Ma łączyć: zakwaterowanie, lokalne doświadczenia (np. gotowanie z lokalnymi kucharzami, spacery z przewodnikiem) oraz inne usługi związane z podróżą. To ma być coś w rodzaju „cyfrowego towarzysza podróży”. Nie mówi wprost, że stworzy „superaplikację” jak np. chiński WeChat, ale jego wizja idzie w tym kierunku: zbudowania wszechstronnej platformy, która będzie towarzyszyć użytkownikowi na każdym etapie podróży – od inspiracji, przez rezerwację, aż po lokalne przeżycia. Superaplikacja uratuje Airbnb? Ma też nastąpić głęboka integracja ze sztuczną inteligencją. Zainspirowany przyjaźnią z Samem Altmanem, szefem OpenAI, Chesky chce stworzyć osobistego asystenta, „superkonsjerża”. To ma być najważniejsza zmiana w firmie od czasu, gdy razem z kolegą z uczelni Joe Gebbią (studiowali na prestiżowej Rhode Island School of Design) wymyślili Airbnb. Pomysł zrodził się, gdy wraz z Gebbią nie mieli pieniędzy na czynsz – kupili trzy materace i udostępnili je na imprezę designerską w San Francisco, nazywając projekt „Airbed & Breakfast. – Brian jest mocno niedoceniany jako szef technologicznej firmy – mówi Altman w rozmowie z „Wired”. – Nie wymienia się go jednym tchem z Larrym Page'em czy Billem Gatesem, ale myślę, że idzie tą samą drogą. Cios w ambitne plany firmy może jednak przyjść z nieoczekiwanej strony. Ekspansja firmy nie podoba się już nie tylko hotelom czy pensjonatom, ale i coraz większej liczbie wielu mieszkańców miast. To już nie tylko kwestia uciążliwego sąsiedztwa, kiedy w mieszkaniu obok nagle zaczynają nocować setki obcych ludzi. Mieszkańcy wielu miast, zwłaszcza atrakcyjnych turystycznie, narzekają na rosnące koszty życia, w tym czynsze. Wielu właścicieli mieszkań zamiast zwykłych najemców opłacających co miesiąc czynsze woli najem krótkoterminowy, czyli Airbnb. Do tego dochodzi tłok, hałas i korki. Urządzenie polskiej firmy pozwoli sklonować głos i sprawi, że każdy będzie w stanie mówić własnym... To dlatego tysiące osób protestowały w czerwcu w Barcelonie, na Majorce, w Wenecji, Lizbonie i innych miastach, strzelając do turystów z pistoletów na wodę i używając rac. Domagali się od władz ograniczenia masowej turystyki i krótkoterminowych najmów. „Turystyka kradnie nam chleb, dach nad głową i przyszłość” oraz „Turyści, wracajcie do domu” – takie hasła wyrażają wściekłość lokalnych mieszkańców. Zatłoczone miasta – kolejki, hałas, zatkane ulice i wyparcie lokalnych sklepów i mieszkańców. Demonstracji ma być coraz więcej, a władze pod silną presją protestujących utrudniają życie Airbnb. Np. niedawno hiszpański sąd odrzucił apelację firmy i nakazał zablokowanie niemal 66 tys. ogłoszeń, które miały naruszać lokalne regulacje...."

These precious girls, who spent nine weeks in the NICU, came home on April 2 and have since turned the family's life upside down! Describing their new normal, the Rhode Island couple admits it's complete chaos. With four newborns and two toddlers, Rachel noted, ""There's plenty of joy mixed with the madness."" Despite the exhaustion, the family is excitedly embracing this new adventure. Surprisingly, the Vargas parents aren't done yet! Rachel expressed a desire to have more children in the future, hoping to give their son Walter a brother among a sea of sisters. ""We figure once they're older, they can keep each other occupied,"" Marco added, painting a picture of a bustling household. The Vargas family released a heartfelt statement following the quadruplets' birth, noting the emotional journey they faced. After a high-risk pregnancy filled with complications, including twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, Rachel felt overwhelming relief when she first saw her daughters. ""It was glorious seeing these girls being triumphantly pulled out,"" Marco recalled. The family is eager to document their milestones as they grow together, celebrating every little moment. Life in a Busy Household of Six Rachel and Marco Vargas have entered a whirlwind of activity and excitement since welcoming their rare identical quadruplets: Sofía, Philomena, Veronica, and Isabel. As parents of six, including toddlers Walter and Stella, the Rhode Island couple describes their home as an exhilarating mix of joy and chaos. ""There's never a dull moment,"" Marco joked, emphasizing the challenges and joy of parenting four newborns and two energetic toddlers. The couple is learning to navigate this busy life, from late-night feedings to organizing playtime for their older children while ensuring the quadruplets are cared for seamlessly. The new parents relish discovering the distinct quirks of each quadruplet. Whether it's Sofía's adorable tuft of hair or Veronica's notable birthmark, the girls are already establishing their unique identities within their bustling home. The family cherishes these little distinctions amid the hectic atmosphere. Despite the current pandemonium, Rachel and Marco remain open to expanding their family even further. ""We envision a full house of love and life,"" Rachel shared, expressing her desire for a brother for Walter. With thoughts of a lively family society in mind, the couple continues embracing their transformative journey with enthusiasm. Unique Traits of Each Identical Sister The Vargas quadruplets — Sofía, Philomena, Veronica, and Isabel — may look identical, but each girl has her own special traits that make her stand out. As they continue their adorable journey as the country's rare set of identical quadruplets, the proud parents have taken note of these unique characteristics. Among the sisters, Sofía has quickly claimed her title as the plumpest of the quartet. Her unmistakable bushy hair sets her apart, making it easy for mom and dad to identify her at a glance. With her vivacious personality already shining through, it's clear that Sofía is destined to be the star of the family. While the sisters share many features, Isabel boasts a distinctive little dot on her cleft that sets her apart from her identical siblings. This tiny mark has become a sweet and memorable identifier for the Vargas family, ensuring Isabel's individuality shines even while navigating life in a busy household. Veronica, with her unique V-shaped birthmark on her forehead, adds another layer of individuality to the quadruplets. This charming feature not only distinguishes her from her sisters but also tells a story that will surely captivate her parents and siblings as they grow older together. Though she may not have any distinguishing marks, Philomena carries her own kind of magic. Her effortless ability to blend in with her identical sisters adds an air of mystery and intrigue. The Vargas family delights in discovering Philomena's unique quirks and personality as she establishes her own identity within the fabulous foursome. Future Plans for Family Expansion Rachel and Marco Vargas, the parents of identical quadruplets, have shared their exciting plans for expanding their family. Despite the whirlwind of raising six children, the Rhode Island couple is open to adding more energetic girls or perhaps a little brother to their lively household. With their eldest son Walter feeling a bit outnumbered among his five sisters, Rachel expressed her desire to help him have a male counterpart. ""If I can give him a brother, I'd certainly like to do it,"" she said, hinting that they see their family growing beyond the current dynamic. Marco chimed in, sharing his optimistic outlook on their full house. He believes that as the children age, they will naturally keep each other entertained. ""They'll form a little society,"" he noted, highlighting the joys of sibling camaraderie in a bustling family setting. As they navigate the challenges of parenthood, the Vargas family's journey continues to inspire many. Rachel and Marco's hearts are open, embracing the beautiful chaos that comes with expanding their loving family."

Workday concerning allegations that Workday's AI-driven hiring tools discriminate against applicants over the age of 40. Continue reading for an in-depth analysis of these and other significant updates. Regulatory, Legislative & Litigation Developments AI Moratorium Language in Budget Legislation Draws Criticism Buried within the recent congressional budget legislation passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, referred to as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" is a proposal to implement a 10-year moratorium on state regulation of artificial intelligence, complicating the current AI regulatory environment. Advocates of the moratorium contend that it will prevent delays in the progress of companies operating within the rapidly evolving AI sector, which could be hindered by a confusing array of state regulations targeting similar issues. However, many legislators in both the House and Senate, along with state lawmakers across the country, have expressed concerns that this ban on state AI regulation would hinder states ability to enact crucial regulations to safeguard residents, workers, and consumers from the potential misuse of AI technologies. Following its passage in the House, the bill has advanced to the Senate, where it is presently under further examination and modification. A revised version ties the distribution of specific federal broadband funding to compliance with the moratorium. The Senate parliamentarian has ruled that this revision allows the moratorium to pass the Byrd Rule associated with reconciliation, advancing the moratorium closer to implementation.

976810c62d96fcec6b43bf859c74273b,2025-07-01 09:55:00,en,WEB,"  Homelessness in America has reached record levels. And if Congress passes President Trump's proposed budget – which he touts as the “ Big Beautiful Bill ” – both Rhode Island's and the country's homelessness crisis will only get worse. The president's proposal will cut $4 billion in services for people experiencing homelessness and eliminate proven programs like the Continuum of Care, which manages our state's homelessness response, the Youth Homelessness Demonstration Program, and permanent supportive housing — all of which form the backbone of a coordinated national response to homelessness. On the surface, some might celebrate these cuts as cost savings. But in practice, a growing crisis of homelessness - in red and blue states alike - will drive up public health and public safety costs, and cripple state and local communities. Advertisement In Rhode Island, these cuts could end funding for permanent supportive housing , forcing individuals and families from their homes. In addition, because these apartments can be rented only to low-income tenants, affordable housing units would sit empty and we'd see a plague of vacant properties casting shadows over dangerous and unnecessary tent encampments. Construction of new housing developments that are in the pipeline also would grind to a halt, putting construction and building trade jobs at risk. Get Rhode Map A weekday briefing from veteran Rhode Island reporters, focused on the things that matter most in the Ocean State. Enter Email Sign Up If Congress passes the president's budget and cuts funding for permanent supportive housing, Rhode Island's homelessness crisis will escalate further into a Category Five emergency. Hospitals will become bottlenecks, unable to discharge unhoused patients who have nowhere safe to go. Emergency shelters — already operating at capacity — will be overwhelmed, pushing more people back onto the streets. Police and first responders will be forced to manage health and behavioral crises that stem not from criminal activity, but from untreated illness and housing instability. Advertisement The proposed budget would also cause further harm to the nation's safety nets by putting an arbitrary two-year cap on social services for so-called abled-bodied adults and shifting the financial burden to state and local governments that are already stretched thin. The Big Beautiful Bill would gut Community Development Block Grants, end the HOME Investment Partnership Program, and paralyze dozens of other health and social service grants that protect people from falling into homelessness in the first place. Put most simply, the president's proposed budget will create chaos across the nation's housing systems. It would abandon evidence-based approaches in favor of a fragmented, underfunded system with overcrowded shelters and dwindling options for permanent housing. Permanent supportive housing has proven time and again to be a cost-effective solution to homelessness. It reduces emergency room visits, hospital stays, and shelter use — while restoring dignity, stability, and hope. It is one of the smartest investments we can make. Ending homelessness has never been a partisan endeavor. If we allow it to become one, the devastating fiscal and societal consequences of a prolonged crisis will not discriminate between red and blue states or urban and rural communities. If Congress approves the president's cuts to Homeless Assistance Grants and other vital programs, they are waving a white flag of surrender in the fight to end homelessness, and the consequences will be nothing short of catastrophic.

wall-228114267_29215,2025-07-01 11:07:19,en,VK,"  React is a popular front-end JavaScript library that is widely used for building user interfaces. With its component-based architecture and declarative programming model, React has become the go-to choice for many developers when it comes to creating complex and dynamic web applications. One of the key benefits of using React is its ability to manage state and data flow in a predictable and efficient manner. This makes it an ideal choice for developing writing applications that require real-time updates and collaboration features. In this article, we will explore some of the key considerations for building a writing service in React, including data management, user authentication, and collaboration features. Data Management When building a writing service, data management is a critical consideration. A writing service typically involves the creation and storage of large amounts of text data, which must be managed efficiently and securely. One way to manage data in a React writing service is to use a database system such as MongoDB or Firebase. These databases offer real-time synchronization and can be easily integrated with React using libraries such as React-Redux or React-Firebase. Another option is to use a serverless architecture such as AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions. These services allow you to run server-side code without having to manage the underlying infrastructure, making it easier to scale your application as needed. User Authentication User authentication is another critical consideration when building a writing service. Users must be able to securely log in and access their data, while also ensuring that their data is protected from unauthorized access. One way to implement user authentication in a React writing service is to use a third-party authentication service such as Auth0 or Firebase Authentication. These services provide a secure and reliable way to manage user authentication and can be easily integrated with React using libraries such as React-Router or React-Firebase. Collaboration Features Finally, (EditaPaper) => vk.cc/cMZDnO collaboration features are an essential aspect of any writing service. Users should be able to collaborate on documents in real-time, with features such as real-time editing, commenting, and version control. One approach to implementing collaboration features in a React writing service is to use a real-time collaboration library such as ShareDB or Firebase Realtime Database. These libraries provide real-time synchronization and conflict resolution, allowing multiple users to collaborate on the same document in real-time. Another option is to use a version control system such as Git, which can be integrated with React using libraries such as React-Git. This approach allows users to collaborate on documents using a familiar version control workflow, with features such as branching and merging. Conclusion Building a writing service in React requires careful consideration of data management, user authentication, and collaboration features. By using the right tools and libraries, you can create a robust and scalable writing service that meets the needs of your users. Whether you are building a personal writing app or a collaborative writing platform for teams, React provides the flexibility and power you need to bring your ideas to life. With its vibrant community and extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools, React is the perfect choice for building modern and dynamic web applications.Easy Pass is an electronic toll collection system used on toll roads, bridges, and tunnels in the United States. The system allows drivers to pay tolls electronically, eliminating the need for cash transactions and reducing congestion at toll plazas. In this article, we will provide a detailed overview of the Easy Pass system, how it works, how to get one, and the benefits of using it. Overview of the Easy Pass System The Easy Pass system uses a small electronic device that is installed in your vehicle, typically on the windshield or dashboard. When you pass through a toll plaza, the device sends a signal to the toll plaza's sensors, and the toll is automatically deducted from your Easy Pass account. The system works by linking your Easy Pass device to a prepaid account. You can add funds to your account using a credit card, debit card, or bank transfer. When you use the Easy Pass system, the toll amount is deducted from your account balance. When your account balance gets low, you will receive a notification to add more funds. You can also set up automatic payments, so your account will be automatically replenished when the balance gets low. How to Get an Easy Pass Getting an Easy Pass is a straightforward process. You can apply for an Easy Pass online, by mail, or in person at an Easy Pass customer service center. To apply, you will need to provide personal and vehicle information, including your name, address, vehicle make and model, and license plate number. You will also need to choose a payment method and decide how much money you want to add to your account. Once you receive your Easy Pass device, you can activate it by following the instructions provided. Benefits of Using Easy Pass There are many benefits to using the Easy Pass system. One of the most significant benefits is the time saved at toll plazas. With Easy Pass, you can drive through toll plazas without stopping, reducing congestion and saving time. Another benefit is the cost savings...."

mov_9D08993078E11A85C9A929168894607B,2025-07-01 12:00:00,en,WEB,"  Startups are declaring victory everywhere. Pepsi spent a monumental $2 billion for Poppi. E.l.f. cosmetics wired $1 billion to Hailey Bieber for Rhode. Most recently, Unilever swooped up Dr.Squatch for $1.5 billion. Most recently, start-up politician Zohran Mamdani upset Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral primary. Back in February, Mamdani was polling at a negligible one percent. He trounced Cuomo by 43.1 percent to 34.5 percent. These four startup successes show a great deal, individually and collectively, about not just the state of voters and consumers, but also about the zeitgeist and the changing ions in the air. Here's what Mamdani's upset of the mature brand Cuomo proves about legacy entities and institutions. What you see is not all that's there Much has been made of Mamdani's effective use of social media. I don't need to relitigate that. What hasn't been widely discussed, though, is that the hyper-targeted nature of Instagram and TikTok—and how their algorithms work—means that if you weren't in the potential voting audience, you likely weren't exposed to the full firehouse of his social media posts. As a result, the palpable sense of a movement being formed and gaining momentum, of a political phenomenon in the works, was totally lost on voters outside the Mamdani demographic, or even reporters. It's the availability heuristic at work, which describes the psychological process by which your worldview is shaped by that which you grok from your zone of perception. Featured Video An Inc.com Featured Presentation The message to legacy brands is that they, too—despite all their consumer research and the marketing tools available—are locked in their own narrow world of observation. The blinders they have on—that block a wide-angle view of the world—are hardwired into the human brain by evolutionary biology. Younger hunger The conventional wisdom is that young voters don't vote. According to researchers at the University of California, they are “fatalistic about critical problems such as economic inequality, climate change, and the future of democracy.” The election in America's largest city proved these experts, and so many others, wrong. Young people turned out because they have a hunger for change and a belief in new possibilities, no matter what you might think of their choice. The startup brand successes were all driven by the same muscular rejection of traditional options. This puts legacy brands in a double-bind. Their systems are both unable to innovate and connect with consumers on the emotional level that start-ups can. At the same time, those very systems crush the soul of these startup brands once they acquire them. As soon as the earn-out is paid, founders flee. A perfect example of an innovation-crusher, ironically, is Unilever, the buyer of Dr. Squatch. They acquired the hot Dollar Shave Club, turned it ice cold, and sold it to private equity. If legacy brands don't allow acquired brands to continue unaltered, they will destroy value. Inspiration before explanation Mamdani has been criticized for making promises without explaining how he will pay for them. For example, free buses and child-care, freezing the rent, and launching city-owned grocery stores. It has been said you campaign in poetry and govern in prose, and in this case, the candidate was Milton-esque. This is also true for marketing, especially in the exploding wellness and self-care category. David Beckham's IM8 promises “Daily Ultimate Longevity” through its “Cell Rejuvenation Technology.” Neuro's campaign—and how interesting that politicians and brands both run campaigns claims “neuroprotection, mitochondrial stabilization, and longevity in one capsule.” That's a lot of poetry. Too many legacy brands—in consumer goods, technology, and virtually every category—get the sequence wrong. They start with explanations and lose the audience before the conversation starts. Better to start with inspiration, which frames the brain, activates dopamine, and makes the consumer—or voter—ready and predisposed to believe. No laurels for legacy Andrew Cuomo, as both a multi-term governor and a son of a former governor, was the ultimate legacy candidate. Not many candidates have their last name emblazoned on a bridge. He behaved with that entitlement. The New York Times said it was widely acknowledged that his campaign was “joyless and lackluster.” The new reality is that legacy brands actually have to work harder than the newbies. They have to out-hustle their start-up competitors because creation in a vacuum can be much easier than shifting within a zone...."

The Senate voted 99-1 to strike the AI provision for the legislation after weeks of criticism from both Republican and Democratic governors and state officials. Originally proposed as a 10-year ban on states doing anything to regulate AI, lawmakers later tied it to federal funding so that only states that backed off on AI regulations would be able to get subsidies for broadband internet or AI infrastructure. A last-ditch Republican effort to save the provision would have reduced the time frame to five years and sought to exempt some favored AI laws, such as those protecting children or country music performers from harmful AI tools. But that effort was abandoned when Sen. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican, teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington on Monday night to introduce an amendment to strike the entire proposal. Voting on the amendment happened after 4 a.m. Wednesday as part of an overnight session as Republican leaders sought to secure support for the tax cut bill while fending off other proposed amendments, mostly from Democrats trying to defeat the package.

Opinions represent the viewpoint of the author. Unsigned editorials represent the consensus opinion of The Columbian's editorial board, which operates independently of the news department. While the majority of Washington voters did not support Donald Trump's successful reelection bid in 2024, he is nonetheless this state's president, too, so his administration should not be treating Washington differently than other U.S. states. But that is exactly what it is doing. Case in point: The U.S. Department of Justice's decision to intervene in Catholic leaders' lawsuit against Washington over the new law that requires clergy members to report child abuse or neglect, even if the information is learned during confession. Catholic leaders say the new law “forces priests to choose between breaking the sacred seal of confession” or face jail time, the Seattle Times reported. Harmeet K. Dhillon, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, said laws targeting religious practices “have no place” in society, the Seattle Times reported. Apparently, it depends just which society Trump's Justice Department is talking about, because several other states, including deep red Texas and Oklahoma, also have child abuse reporting laws that make an exception for the so-called penitent privilege. The Seattle Times notes it asked the Justice Department why it isn't targeting those states' laws as well, but it didn't respond, beyond sending the newspaper a link to its announcement about intervening in the Washington case. We are not taking a position on Washington's law and the Catholic Church's lawsuit against it. Rather, we think it's a fair question to ask why the DOJ is inserting itself into the lawsuit against our state, while not taking exception to similar laws in Texas, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and North Carolina. New Hampshire, for example, does have what it calls “clergy-penitent privilege,” but, according to the Victims Rights Law Center, “The clergy-penitent privilege does not constitute grounds for failing to report child abuse.” In Texas, the Victims Rights Law Center reports, “The requirement to report … applies without exception to an individual whose personal communications may otherwise be privileged, including … a member of the clergy.” And as News9.com in Oklahoma City reported, “Oklahoma law explicitly states that no privilege — such as doctor-patient or clergy-penitent privilege — relieves any person from the duty to report suspected child abuse or neglect.” The DOJ's intervention appears to be less about striving to champion religious freedom and more about punishing states led by Democrats. And that helps shed light on the administration's refusal to provide federal aid to help pay for tens of millions of dollars in damage to public property caused by the November bomb cyclone. As the Washington State Standard reported, the Trump administration denied the state's request for federal disaster relief in April. Washington filed an appeal, but the administration rejected it, with a Federal Emergency Management Agency official simply saying aid “is not warranted.” “They still refuse to explain their outrageous decision,” Gov. Bob Ferguson said in a statement, according to the Washington State Standard. “My team and I are working to exhaust every possible avenue to get additional support for our state's recovery. We cannot count on the Trump Administration to uphold its responsibilities to Washingtonians.” Trump is Washington's president too. But his administration's double-standard toward our state and its laws demonstrate disdain, not leadership."

Den amerikanska förvaltarprofilen och tennis-entusiasten Bill Ackman spelar nämligen dubbel tillsammans med Richey Reneberg som en gång i tiden var rankad världsetta i grenen. – Men Bill är bra och han spelar mycket. Plus att man inte alltid kan välja vart bollen ska, berättar Lassi Ketola som själv kom att spela men förlora i en finalmatch mot amerikanerna Jason Pinsky och Brandon O'Gara under helgens upplaga av Finance Cup, en återkommande tennisturnering för finansfolk. – Det är alltid väldigt tävlingsinriktat. De som är med här håller sig i form. Och USA tar alltid med sig några unga spelare. Det här är tennis på hög nivå. Lassi Ketola är ett typexempel bland de 52 spelare som deltar och har efter en karriär som aspirerande tennisproffs kommit att verka inom finansbranschen. Av allt att döma så finns det många kopplingar mellan börs och sporten. – Tennisen kräver ansträngning och ihärdighet. Det är också väldigt tävlingsinriktat och jag tror att detta är egenskaper som också passar bra i affärslivet, berättar Bill Ackman själv när han hälsar välkommen till den storstilade middag på lördagens kväll som rundade av veckoslutets turnering. Bill Ackman har slagit på stort Tennisens ekonomi är en förklarande faktor till att skaran atleter i finansbranschen är så stor, resonerar han. Pengarna flyter inte till spelarna i tillräckligt hög utsträckning vilket gör att ganska få spelare blir verkligt förmögna. – Inom tennisen så måste man faktiskt skaffa sig ett jobb efteråt, säger Bill Ackman. På honom själv går det förstås ingen nöd. Bill Ackman är en av USA:s mest framträdande hedgefondsprofiler, på senare tid även aktiv i landets politiska debatt och en hängiven Trump-supporter. Som värd för tennisturneringen, som växlar årsvis mellan att spelas i Europa och USA, har han slagit på stort. – Newport är otroligt, en spektakulär stad, säger han om den saltstänkta staden i USA:s minsta delstat Rhode Island mitt emellan Boston och New York. Finance Cup Är en årlig tennisturnering där Europas finansbransch gör upp mot Wall Street. Ett 20-tal deltagare som arbetar på kapitalförvaltare och banker brukar delta. Upplägget för själva turneringen har varierat genom åren, men nu spelas dubbelmatcher i två kategorier: över och under 55 år. Efter Bill Ackman hör Rob Pohly som grundat hedgefonden Samlyn Capital, fransmannen Loïc Féry och John Doran som är vd för tech-investeraren TCV, till de tyngsta namnen ur ett finansmanna-perspektiv. Vid sidan av Cevian-grundaren Christer Gardell deltar regelbundet bankiren Jan Olsson, fastighetsinvesteraren David Anving, samt Tobias Hildebrand vid Nordea, liksom Martin Persson som är fondförvaltare på Länsförsäkringar. Montenegrin-kanadensaren Milos Raonic, som bäst världstrea, var den högst rankade tennisspelaren i årets upplaga, men han närvarade enbart vid middagen. Mario Ančić, tidigare världssjua, spelade däremot och har så gjort sedan den första turneringen 2015. Bland de högst rankade tennisspelarna märks även Richey Reneberg, som varit världsetta i dubbel, samt egyptiern Ahmed El Mehelmy och holländaren Hendrik Jan Davids. Kuststräckan norr om Manhattan är ett välbeställd stråk av samhällen där gamla pengar blandas med träbåtar och New England-stil på kläderna. Newport, som ligger nära både Marthas Vineyard och Kennedy-klanens favorittillhåll Cape Cod, stoltserar också med en av tennisvärldens mest småtrevliga institutioner. International Tennis Hall of Fame är en historiskt präglad klubb, där bruna träbyggnader och ett anslutande museum omger ett dussin välklippta gräsplaner. – Jag röker inte gräs men jag spelar gärna på det. Och det här är det bästa gräs jag provat, skojar Bill Ackman till publikens jubel under middagen, för att sedan skämta vidare om det överdådiga marmorpalatset Marble House där middagen hålls. – Här finns trevliga kåkar att hyra. Det Vita huset-liknande palatset byggdes på 1800-talets slut som ett sommarboende för Alva Vanderbilt, som fick det i 39-årspresent av sina arvtagare till make, William Kissam Vanderbilt. – Jag frågar mig vad hon fick i fyrtioårspresent, skämtar svenske fastighetsinvesteraren David Anving om det amerikanska överdådet. Brokig skara finansfolk som samlas David Anving må vara en doldis inom det svenska näringslivet men är spindeln i nätet för den europeiska halvan av turneringen. Där spelar även Deutsche Bank-veteranen Jan Olsson och aktieaktivisten Christer Gardell framträdande roller. Det är en något brokiga skara finansfolk som samlats ihop från kontinenten. På Finance Cup kan man höra Loïc Féry, fransk finansman som äger ett fotbollslag, klaga över att han gjort sig illa i handleden då han skulle slå en lobb. Vid baren knorrar svenske Tobias Hildebrand över hur Richey Reneberg, stående vid samma bar, slog ut honom i en dubbel vid Stockholm Open 1997. – Jag ser fortfarande hans namn ingraverat i en pokal varje gång jag tränar på Kungliga tennishallen, berättar svensken som efter ett drygt kvartssekel verkar ha hämtat sig från nederlaget. Faktum är att han är på ett strålande humör. Det är alla, även om många haltar efter en lång dag av matcher. Christer Gardell brukar flyga in en kiropraktor till turneringarna, men han fick stanna hemma år då amerikanerna stod som värdar. Högst rankade tennisspelaren i samlingen är kroaten Mario Ančić, som slog Roger Federer i Wimbledon 2002. – Jag var som bäst rankad sjua i världen, berättar han under fördrinken till galamiddagen...."

From left, Timmy's mother Patty, Timmy, his father Tim, and his sister Julia. (Photos courtesy of the Howard family) KINGSTON, R.I. – July 1, 2025 – When Timothy “Timmy” Howard graduated from the University of Rhode Island with a bachelor's degree in communications in May, it was a joyous moment for himself and his loved ones. Just days later, tragedy struck when the 22-year-old passed away from an allergic reaction to peanuts while having a snack in his family's home in Southborough, Massachusetts. “He came in our room and woke us up, and said that he couldn't breathe,” his father Tim Howard said. “At that point, everything unfolded in a matter of minutes.” Timmy's parents called 911 and administered multiple epinephrine auto-injectors, commonly known as EpiPens, but the reaction was too far along. “Timmy was on the cusp of just starting his life,” his mother Patty Howard said. “We appreciate the support we've received from the URI community, Timmy's friends, and family during this very difficult time.” With the blessing of his family, Timmy's friends from URI's Phi Kappa Psi fraternity set up an online fundraiser on Give a Hand to benefit Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE), the nation's leading nonprofit organization dedicated to food allergy awareness, advocacy, research, and education. As of June 26, more than $29,000 has been raised from 659 donors. “It's amazing how much money has been raised,” said Patty. “The response has been tremendous and it's much appreciated.” One of Timmy's closest fraternity brothers, Kourosh Emami, spearheaded the FARE fundraiser. Timmy Howard, center, with two of his closest friends at the University of Rhode Island, Tyler Schultz, left, and Kourosh Emami. “Timmy taught me that goodness never has to be loud to be strong,” said Emami, who completed a bachelor's degree from URI in biological sciences in May. “He was always there for me when I needed it most—not with big gestures or grand speeches, but with an unwavering presence and real listening. In a world—and especially a college environment—that is often dominated by the loudest voices, Timmy never chased attention. He didn't need to. His authenticity and kindness spoke louder than words.” Emami and fellow fraternity brother Tyler Schultz lived with Timmy the last two years in a house they rented with others from their fraternity pledge class. “Timmy always had a smile on his face and never complained about anything,” said Schultz, a native of Livingston, New Jersey, who earned a bachelor's degree from URI in business administration. “He loved to be with everyone but also knew when he needed time for himself. He taught me so much about myself and how to treat others. He meant so much to me, not just as a friend or a roommate, but almost like another brother.” After Timmy's death received media attention, people from all over the world reached out to the Howard family to express support. “We've been contacted by parents who lost children in a similar way,” said Patty. “We need to come together to spread awareness about food allergies and try to influence positive changes, such as making it mandatory for EpiPens to be readily available in every school, camp, and first responder's vehicle. Early detection is key and EpiPens are the best defense with a severe food allergy reaction. In Timmy's situation, the EpiPens were not administered soon enough and could not stop his body from going into shock.” Patty also emphasized the need to clarify common misconceptions about food allergies. Timmy Howard, wearing a Boston Bruins jersey, surrounded by his Phi Kappa Psi fraternity brothers. “Some myths can be dangerous, such as thinking Benadryl is just as good as an epinephrine auto-injector when it comes to stopping a severe allergic reaction,” said Patty. “Benadryl will never stop a severe anaphylaxis reaction. Many people also don't realize that tree nuts and peanuts are two common, but separate food allergens. A peanut is a type of legume, such as beans and peas. They don't necessarily have the same health properties as tree nuts. Classifying these nuts can be critical for people who have severe allergies.” According to FARE, 33 million Americans have life-threatening food allergies, including one out of every 13 children. Peanut allergies are the most common food allergy in children under age 18 and the third-most common food allergy in adults. “Hopefully we can get to the root cause of why food allergies are on the rise and come up with a device for early detection of a severe anaphylactic reaction and eventually find a cure,” said Patty. “Not much has changed in my opinion in the 20 years our family has dealt with food allergies. There needs to be more done on diagnosis, early detection of an anaphylactic reaction, and access.” That is what Patty and Timmy's brothers at Phi Kappa Psi are hoping that funds raised will go to help. According to his family, joining Phi Kappa Psi enabled Timmy to form some of the closest friendships of his life. “Timmy had an infectious smile, but he could be quiet and shy,” said Patty. “Joining the fraternity helped him develop friendships. He loved hanging out with his frat brothers. He was authentic and genuine...."
mov_FB7B2B16170099DBBCFA4E5A73A1BEB7,2025-07-01 14:27:20,en,WEB,"  NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James and 15 other attorneys general sued the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon for unlawfully terminating more than $1 billion in bipartisan federal funding for school-based mental health services. Attorney General James and the coalition are challenging ED's abrupt decision to discontinue funding for two mental health grant programs – the Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grant Program (MHSP) and the School-Based Mental Health Services Grant Program (SBMH) – which Congress created in response to the worsening youth mental health crisis and a series of tragic school shootings, including in Parkland, Florida and Uvalde, Texas. The attorneys general argue that ED's terminations are unconstitutional and ideologically driven, and are urging the court to reinstate the funding and protect the critical youth mental health infrastructure schools have built under these programs. “By cutting funding for these lifesaving youth mental health programs, the Department of Education is abandoning our children when they need us most,” said Attorney General James. “These grants have helped thousands of students access critical mental health services at a time when young people are facing record levels of depression, trauma, and anxiety. To eliminate these grants now would be a grave disservice to children and families in New York and nationwide, and my office is fighting back to preserve these much-needed programs.” “SUNY is grateful to Attorney General James for protecting New Yorkers, including critical resources for mental health support,” said SUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr. “At a time when school-based mental health services are more important than ever, SUNY is proud that our campuses play a vital role in training mental health providers and we will vigorously defend this important work.” In 2018, following the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Congress established and funded MHSP to address a shortage of mental health professionals in high-need public schools. Two years later, Congress expanded these efforts with SBMH, which provided funding to help schools hire, train, and retain school-based mental health staff. In the wake of the devastating 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Congress dramatically increased funding for both programs, appropriating more than $100 million annually to each program through 2026 and requiring ED to submit detailed spending plans and biweekly updates. Each program was designed as a five-year initiative, with the goal of placing 14,000 new mental health professionals in schools, particularly those in low-income and rural areas. In the lawsuit, the attorneys general highlight the broad, bipartisan support behind these programs. As Republican Texas Senator John Cornyn noted, Congress “crafted this landmark law with a simple purpose: to reduce violence and save lives.” He explained that the law contains “commonsense measures to improve how our schools address mental health,” noting that “too often, adolescents with untreated mental health conditions become the very same perpetrators who commit acts of violence.” Attorney General James and the coalition emphasize that these programs have already demonstrated measurable success. In the first year alone, nearly 775,000 students received mental or behavioral health services. More than 1,200 school-based mental health professionals were hired and 95 percent retained. Student wait times dropped by 80 percent. Grantees reported a 50 percent reduction in suicide risk at high-need schools, lower absenteeism and behavioral incidents, and stronger student-staff relationships. Despite these successes, on April 29, 2025, the administration abruptly notified dozens of grantees that their funding would be discontinued, claiming that these program were no longer aligned with “current administration priorities.” The boilerplate notices included vague justifications with no specific findings or performance issues. In statements to Congress and the media, ED acknowledged that it targeted grants for discontinuation based on the programs' diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) goals, despite the fact that such efforts were required under longstanding federal law and were part of the announced criteria used to evaluate and award the grants. As a result of the administration's decision to discontinue mental health funding, Attorney General James and the coalition assert that, starting this fall, public schools nationwide will no longer reliably be able to offer critical mental health services. The attorneys general argue that if allowed to move forward, these terminations will force the layoffs of hundreds of school-based mental health professionals, abruptly end services for thousands of vulnerable students, dismantle graduate training pipelines that were helping to address nationwide shortages, and destroy projects that have been years in the making. New York stands to lose at least $19 million in previously approved funding as a result of these cuts, including over $7.6 million for the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Unless the terminations are reversed, SUNY Binghamton will be forced to pull mental health professionals from schools serving more than 9,000 rural students, laying off 10 full-time staff and several part-time employees and graduate assistants. SUNY Buffalo would be forced to end a fellowship program training school social workers to serve students in Western New York, jeopardizing care for an estimated 3,000 students. Several New York school districts and private institutions have also had their funding discontinued, jeopardizing mental health services for students in the Bronx, Queens, Brooklyn, Long Island, Hudson Valley, Finger Lakes, Mohawk Valley, Central New York, and other communities throughout the state. Attorney General James and the coalition argue that the cancellation of this funding is both unlawful and unconstitutional, as it undermines Congress' authority and equity directive and violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) because of the lack of notice. The attorneys general also contend that the administration breached the grant agreements and violated federal regulations that govern the continuation of grant awards. Under these regulations, once a multiyear grant is awarded, the decision to continue funding must be based on the grantee's performance. In this case, ED failed to offer any evidence that the grantees failed to meet performance standards and instead applied an ideological litmus test after the fact, leaving schools and students to suffer the consequences. The attorneys general are asking the court to declare these grant terminations unlawful, reinstate the funding for the full intended term of the awards, and prevent ED from imposing similar ideological conditions moving forward.

mov_44427D2760104F00B7CB206DB7F1A15B,2025-07-01 14:45:52,en,WEB,"  NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James and 15 other attorneys general sued the U.S. Department of Education (ED) and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon for unlawfully terminating more than $1 billion in bipartisan federal funding for school-based mental health services. Attorney General James and the coalition are challenging ED's abrupt decision to discontinue funding for two mental health grant programs – the Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grant Program (MHSP) and the School-Based Mental Health Services Grant Program (SBMH) – which Congress created in response to the worsening youth mental health crisis and a series of tragic school shootings, including in Parkland, Florida and Uvalde, Texas. The attorneys general argue that ED's terminations are unconstitutional and ideologically driven, and are urging the court to reinstate the funding and protect the critical youth mental health infrastructure schools have built under these programs. “By cutting funding for these lifesaving youth mental health programs, the Department of Education is abandoning our children when they need us most,” said Attorney General James. “These grants have helped thousands of students access critical mental health services at a time when young people are facing record levels of depression, trauma, and anxiety. To eliminate these grants now would be a grave disservice to children and families in New York and nationwide, and my office is fighting back to preserve these much-needed programs.” “SUNY is grateful to Attorney General James for protecting New Yorkers, including critical resources for mental health support,” said SUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr. “At a time when school-based mental health services are more important than ever, SUNY is proud that our campuses play a vital role in training mental health providers and we will vigorously defend this important work.” In 2018, following the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Congress established and funded MHSP to address a shortage of mental health professionals in high-need public schools. Two years later, Congress expanded these efforts with SBMH, which provided funding to help schools hire, train, and retain school-based mental health staff. In the wake of the devastating 2022 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Congress dramatically increased funding for both programs, appropriating more than $100 million annually to each program through 2026 and requiring ED to submit detailed spending plans and biweekly updates. Each program was designed as a five-year initiative, with the goal of placing 14,000 new mental health professionals in schools, particularly those in low-income and rural areas. In the lawsuit, the attorneys general highlight the broad, bipartisan support behind these programs. As Republican Texas Senator John Cornyn noted, Congress “crafted this landmark law with a simple purpose: to reduce violence and save lives.” He explained that the law contains “commonsense measures to improve how our schools address mental health,” noting that “too often, adolescents with untreated mental health conditions become the very same perpetrators who commit acts of violence.” Attorney General James and the coalition emphasize that these programs have already demonstrated measurable success. In the first year alone, nearly 775,000 students received mental or behavioral health services. More than 1,200 school-based mental health professionals were hired and 95 percent retained. Student wait times dropped by 80 percent. Grantees reported a 50 percent reduction in suicide risk at high-need schools, lower absenteeism and behavioral incidents, and stronger student-staff relationships. Despite these successes, on April 29, 2025, the administration abruptly notified dozens of grantees that their funding would be discontinued, claiming that these program were no longer aligned with “current administration priorities.” The boilerplate notices included vague justifications with no specific findings or performance issues. In statements to Congress and the media, ED acknowledged that it targeted grants for discontinuation based on the programs' diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) goals, despite the fact that such efforts were required under longstanding federal law and were part of the announced criteria used to evaluate and award the grants. As a result of the administration's decision to discontinue mental health funding, Attorney General James and the coalition assert that, starting this fall, public schools nationwide will no longer reliably be able to offer critical mental health services. The attorneys general argue that if allowed to move forward, these terminations will force the layoffs of hundreds of school-based mental health professionals, abruptly end services for thousands of vulnerable students, dismantle graduate training pipelines that were helping to address nationwide shortages, and destroy projects that have been years in the making. New York stands to lose at least $19 million in previously approved funding as a result of these cuts, including over $7.6 million for the State University of New York (SUNY) system. Unless the terminations are reversed, SUNY Binghamton will be forced to pull mental health professionals from schools serving more than 9,000 rural students, laying off 10 full-time staff and several part-time employees and graduate assistants. SUNY Buffalo would be forced to end a fellowship program training school social workers to serve students in Western New York, jeopardizing care for an estimated 3,000 students.

mov_C669C90559A351C7AEF112C88B595EBA,2025-07-01 14:47:02,en,WEB,"  The summer is offseason for a football writer like me. But beer season never stops, even if you're on vacation in the Maritimes. Paying attention to minor league hockey growing up in Rhode Island made me aware of the southeastern corner of Canada. Between that, some recommendations from acquaintances and a general appreciation of its Wikipedia page, I landed in Halifax for a four-day summer stay up north. With me were my family (i.e. children who could be indoctrinated to say things like ""dudes rock"" as we jumped into 51 degree water), a few friends, their families and the general desire to explore the area's non-Moosehead beers (I love Moosehead. It was the fancy beer I bought when I had a little extra money in college. But I can get it in Wisconsin, so...). Because my brain is broken in a way that's unable to completely shut off work (or remember things without documentation), I kept a log of all the best things I drank while in Nova Scotia. This is not an exhaustive list. I had four days there and I'm certain I missed so many great things. But I did get to try a fair amount of what the province has to offer. Here's what I liked most. Propeller Brewing Company's Galaxy IPA Music bingo at Propeller Brewing. So much 90s Canadian alt rock. This was a bit of luck. Propeller is on tap across Halifax, but its taproom happened to be less than a block from the hotel where I stayed my first night. The beers were all solid -- not incredible, but competently made expressions of classic craft brewing styles. The Galaxy IPA was fruity, tart and full-bodied. It gave off lots of citrus that weaved into piney hops. It's pretty good. The vibes at the bar however? IMMACULATE. While we encountered friendly people across Nova Scotia, the folks at Propeller were among the nicest. A music bingo host got us all caught up after joining the game late (and helping us win a generous prize of more beer). The basement arcade was packed with beer drinkers hanging out and watching Terminator 2 on a projection screen, collectively losing their minds every time Linda Hamilton messed someone up or Arnold Schwarzenegger rattled off a one-liner. The bathroom left me with this wisdom: Wisdom for all of us, via the Propeller Brewing Co. bathroom It was my first night in Halifax and I had found my people. Good beer, too. Nine Locks Brewing Company's Frig Off IPA Nine Locks Brewing It only felt right to try a Frig Off while within driving distance of where Trailer Park Boys was shot. This hazy IPA, tilted upward in tribute to the late John Dunsworth (a sensei in the world of acting drunk and pouring concrete). It also came with a fresh caught 1.5-pound lobster for about $40 USD, which felt like a good deal. Nova Scotia's got something for everybody. The Frig Off pours with a hefty, slow-fading head that unleashes waves of bitter citrus ringed by juuuuust a little bit of sugar. That bitterness gives way to an exceptionally smooth hazy ale. The hops settle in toward the back as the current that carries everything along; prevalent but not overwhelming. The fruit weaves through a velvet texture to create a layer of complexity and a clean finish. This was my favorite beer of the trip. North Brewing Company's Malternate Reality New England IPA A flight of beers at North Brewing Co. North Brewing Company's Timberlea Taproom was a godsend -- halfway between our rental house and downtown Halifax and a reliable center for good food and excellent beer both on tap and to-go. Everything in my flight was a ""B+"" or better, ranging from an array of pale ales to a German lager. More in Lifestyle The Malternate Reality and Pleasant Disposition each got the call to live, briefly, in our house fridge before getting crushed on a dock by at least one person who ""doesn't really drink pale ales."" The smell on the Malternate was a bit more sour than I expected, delivering a heap of tart orange up front. But that gives way to an almost sweet hoppiness that folds in just enough malt to give you a wonderfully balanced beer. It's not quite as crushable as the Disposition is, but it's not supposed to be...."

mov_37A20FD0BEAAF1821F74888E1304EFCD,2025-07-01 15:07:13,en,WEB,"  President Donald Trump signs executive orders in the Oval Office of the White House on Jan. 20, 2025. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/) President Donald Trump's energy emergency declaration, enacted through a Jan. 20 executive order, has drawn frequent criticism from environmentalists who argue the order serves as a front to expand the use of fossil fuels over clean energy resources. Now 15 states are suing the Trump administration, arguing the emergency order could bring them serious harm. The states, each represented by Democratic attorneys general, brought action on behalf of their residents and natural resources, arguing the federal government's use of emergency permitting procedures bypass critical ecological, historical and cultural resource reviews. “The Executive Order is unlawful, and its commands that federal agencies disregard the law and in many cases their own regulations to fast-track extensive categories of activities will result in damage to waters, wetlands, critical habitat, historic and cultural resources, endangered species, and the people and wildlife that rely on these precious resources,” the lawsuit reads. In response to a request for comment from Michigan Advance, White House Assistant Press Secretary Taylor Rogers reiterated the administration's position. “In the best interest of our economic and national security, President Trump declared a National Energy Emergency to save America's energy industry stifled by Joe Biden's radical climate agenda. Democrat State Officials can cry about our energy dominance while the rest of the country celebrates the lowest gas prices since 2021,” Rogers said. While the suit acknowledges the need for infrastructure to support a reliable and affordable energy supply for the states and the nation, it argues the president's powers are reserved for actual emergencies, noting earlier in the complaint that energy production in the U.S. is at an all time high and growing. The shortcuts inherent in these powers undermine the rights of the states, the complaint argues, noting the U.S. Army Corps of Engineer's regulations only authorize “emergency procedures” when normal procedures would result in unacceptable hazard to human life, significant loss of property, or immediate, unforeseen, and significant economic hardship. Federal agencies to date have limited emergency procedures to necessary projects during, or in the aftermath of natural or human-made disasters, according to the complaint. To prevent any potential harm, the plaintiff states asked the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington to declare the executive order unlawful and bar federal agencies from pursuing emergency permitting on non-emergency projects. In Michigan, Tribal Nations and environmental activists have spoken out as the Corps moves forward with emergency processing procedures for Enbridge's Line 5 tunnel project, which would replace dual oil and natural gas pipelines running through the lakebed where Lake Michigan and Huron meet, with a new segment housed inside a concrete-lined tunnel buried beneath the bedrock. While the tunnel project came as part of any agreement with the state to minimize the risk of an oil spill, opponents of the project argue construction would harm nearby wetlands, while still carrying risk for an oil spill. The project's public comment window came to an end on Monday. The states other than Michigan filing the lawsuit include Arizona, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin. This story was originally produced by the Michigan Advance which is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network, including the Daily Montanan, supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity."

Key Highlights JB Bail Bonds owner Jill Buratto pleaded guilty to insurance fraud Investigation found altered bond documents and diverted funds Buratto's bail agent license was revoked in May 2024 She was sentenced to probation, fined, and ordered to pay restitution A bail bond business owner and agent was convicted of insurance fraud after investigators found several years' worth of altered bond documents. On June 30, the Idaho Department of Insurance announced that Jill Marie Buratto, of Nampa, and owner of JB Bail Bonds in Meridian, pleaded guilty to insurance fraud. Buratto was found to be “falsely reporting and accounting for fiduciary and/or trust funds and diverting those funds to her own use” over a period of years, DOI stated in a release. She was a licensed bail agent and appointed to issue bail bonds by the Allegheny Casualty Company and International Fidelity Insurance (AIA) company in 2014. According to DOI, an investigation by its fraud unit discovered Buratto had altered penal amounts on several bail bond documents, submitting falsified documents to AIA in the amounts of $10,000 instead of $100,000. The department stated that she “paid significantly lower premiums and trust payments ($100 instead of $1,000 toward each account) while collecting the higher bond amounts from bailees).” The funds that were underreported were used for Buratto's personal spending. The bail bond owner's license was revoked on May 1, 2024, and on June 18, 2025, she was sentenced to five years of probation (the maximum sentence), 60 hours of community service, a $2,000 fine and was ordered to pay restitution. “Trust is essential in any profession, especially in the bail industry,” said Dean L. Cameron, director of DOI. “Families and those needing these services deserve honesty and integrity from those marketing bail bonds. When that trust is broken, it puts consumers and companies at risk.” Cameron added that his department is committed to holding bail agents to account and to ensure the integrity of the industry for residents of the state.

(""VMP"" or the ""Partnership""). VMP will seek to make structured credit investments in mining companies in the Americas. It will primarily target event-driven financing opportunities focused on debt refinancing, acquisition funding, and development capital, providing companies with flexible solutions to accelerate growth and drive shareholder value. VMP will be managed by Breakwall, which has an established track record of successfully investing credit capital across all aspects of energy and energy-adjacent value chains and of facilitating the growth and improvement of conventional, renewable, and ""next generation"" energy companies. This is the second energy credit focused partnership between Vitol and Breakwall. Valor Upstream Credit Partners, L.P. (""VCP""), which is focused on North American upstream oil and gas credit investments, has made over $1 billion in commitments since its launch in June 2023. Christopher Abbate, Jamie Brodsky, and Daniel Flannery, the Managing Partners of Breakwall, stated: ""We are thrilled to partner with Vitol on this new investment strategy.

mov_7F13C1D100441F95585B55B3DE4496D4,2025-07-01 16:03:00,en,WEB,"  Scooter Braun is transitioning his role at HYBE, the South Korean entertainment giant, moving from CEO of HYBE America to an advisory position which will have him joining the HYBE Board of Directors as a director and a senior advisor to chairman and CEO Bang Si-Hyuk. The move marks the end of a five-year run at HYBE, which is home to such K-pop acts as BTS and Katseye. The news was announced to HYBE staffers on Monday when Braun, dialing in from David Geffen's yacht where he is vacationing, notified employees that the move was “in the works for quite some time,” according to a source who adds that the five-year plan was initiated with the sale of Braun's Ithaca Holdings to HYBE in 2021. Braun will remain active in current HYBE projects, like the just-launched girl group Katseye. Braun intimated that he “isn't going anywhere” and will “still help guide” the artists on the HYBE roster. During the call, Braun shared with the staff that, when he set out for a career in music 25 years ago, it was after reading the Geffen biography The Operator. Today, as he closes this chapter of his career, he reminded his colleagues of what he's learned from Geffen: “Follow your dreams and anything can happen.” Braun built his business managing music artists like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, J Balvin, Demi Lovato and The Kid LAROI under the SB Projects banner. In 2024, he stepped away from the management business, announcing his decision on social media, where he noted, “I have been blessed to have had a 'Forrest Gump'-like life while witnessing and taking part in the journeys of some of the most extraordinarily talented people the world has ever seen. I'm constantly pinching myself and asking 'how did I get here?'” The exit from management coincided with a split from Bieber which turned contemptuous, as THR reported in April, due to financial consequences triggered by the cancelation of Bieber's Justice tour in 2022. In not fulfilling his contractual obligation to AEG (the tour's promoter) and completing the concert dates, for which he received a $40 million advance, Bieber was left owing more than $20 million to AEG. Then-manager Braun, through his company, covered what was owed in the form of a loan at a highly favorable (to Bieber) rate. In addition, the two were partnered in a number of other businesses including a record label and film projects. Braun also helped secure a $200 million catalog deal for Bieber's songwriting interests, possibly the largest nest egg in music history for an artist under 30. (Worth noting: Hailey Bieber, who married Justin in 2018, recently sold her Rhode Beauty skincare brand to e.l.f. Beauty for $1 billion; Braun was a seed investor.) THR has learned that a settlement between Braun and Bieber is now completed. “Scooter and Justin squashed their issues and are in a good place,” says a source who adds that Braun's last act at HYBE was to close the book on the squabble and “leave the company, and Justin, in a good position.” Reps for Bieber declined to comment on the settlement. Stepping into the CEO position in Braun's place and leading all day-to-day duties is Isaac Lee, who has been chairman of HYBE Latin America since November of 2023. Lee's new title is chairman and CEO of HYBE Americas. In addition to running HYBE's operations in Mexico, Miami, and Medellin, Lee will also have oversight of Nashville-based Big Machine Label Group (BMLG) and Quality Control Media Holdings, headquartered in Atlanta. While Braun's next move is unclear, HYBE chief Bang Si-Hyuk commented, “Scooter has been an extraordinary partner, a visionary executive, and a true catalyst for cultural exchange. His contributions have been vital in establishing our ambitious presence in the U.S. market. I am deeply grateful for his leadership, his astute instincts and his unwavering passion for artists. We wish him immense success in his exciting next chapter and look forward to continuing our partnership in executing HYBE's global vision.” More in Business Braun also remains one of HYBE's largest individual shareholders. In announcing his new role, Braun said: “Being a part of HYBE and witnessing its remarkable growth has been one of the most inspiring chapters of my professional journey. Chairman Bang is a true visionary and a musical genius. What he has built with HYBE is unparalleled. I am incredibly proud of our collective accomplishments and look forward to supporting Chairman Bang and CEO Jason Jaesang Lee in their continued success as I step into what's next.”"
d32c7a3702e174048f0a8f35f86556b0,2025-07-01 16:23:00,en,WEB,"  Meghan Markle has officially launched her As Ever brand rosé — and with quite a steep price tag. The 2023 Napa Valley Rosé starts at $90 for three bottles, plus $20 flat-rate shipping, meaning you'll have to spend $110 total to try it. Shoppers can also opt for a six-bottle package for $159 or a 12-bottle case for $300. The bottles will begin shipping July 9. However, shipping isn't available in all U.S. states. Those in Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Mississippi, Rhode Island, and Utah who were hoping to try Meghan's newest product will have to wait. And in Hawaii, shipping is only available to the counties of Hawaii and Kauai. International shipping is also unavailable. Still, the hefty price tag didn't appear to deter shoppers, as the rosé sold out in less than an hour. The rosé marks Meghan's first alcoholic offering. “With soft notes of stone fruit, gentle minerality and a lasting finish, this bespoke blend is launching just in time for summer entertaining,” a description for the rosé reads. Meghan's foray into alcoholic beverages comes as the company restocked some of its products in June after selling out in less than an hour during the initial April launch . Among those products were $15 Flower Sprinkles, $14 Crepe Mix, $14 Shortbread Cookie Mix with Flower Sprinkles, and $12 Herbal Teas in three flavors: hibiscus, lemon ginger, and peppermint. The teas, however, have since sold out again. As Ever's June re-launch also introduced two new products: a $28 Limited-Edition Orange Blossom Honey and a $9 Apricot Spread. Both products also quickly sold out. While Meghan didn't restock her viral $9 Raspberry Spread, it will be coming back soon, according to As Ever's website. The restocks and new products follow Meghan's public questioning of her brand . A Page Six report from early June revealed Meghan will be adding “hospitality services in the nature of provision of food and drink” and “hospitality services in the nature of provision of temporary accommodation” to her business, likely in the form of eventual restaurants and hotels. Only weeks earlier, the Duchess said in an interview with Fast Company that she was planning to take a “step back, gather data from the launch, and figure out exactly what As Ever could be.” “I want to really focus on the hospitality angle of As Ever, but as we take the learnings, we can understand what the customer's needs are seasonally,” Meghan told the publication. “My heart is very deeply in my home. Everything comes from being rooted in the love story of your home and garden, and then you can imagine different verticals coming out of that.” Asked whether she might explore moving into clothing one day, Meghan responded: “Fashion is a category I plan to explore down the line because I find it to be an intriguing space for me.”"

4ad5b3bf395a99d7e29bfb76844b02d0,2025-07-01 17:00:00,en,WEB,"  Is The BedJet Cooling System Actually Worth The Price Tag? Here's What Users Are Saying We may receive a commission on purchases made from links. With healthy sleep being an important facet of great overall health, it's no wonder that a ton of people are investing in gadgets to make their bedrooms feel more relaxing. Whether it's an elaborate white noise machine or one of those fancy alarm clocks with gentle music that mimics the sun rising, there's no shortage of ways to make the ritual of sleep an even better experience. But one crucial component to catch better Z's? Having the right temperature under your blanket. After all, most of us spend a good chunk of our lives on our beds. Here at SlashGear, we've featured a viral TikTok cooling blanket in the past, which somewhat hit the right notes and performed well enough during our hands-on review. But for people who have a little more budget, there are other sleepy time gadgets that may be a better fit for your lifestyle, like the BedJet Cooling System. Founded by Mark Aramli, one of the brains who helped keep astronauts comfy during their mission near the stars, BedJet has been around since 2013. Initially a Kickstarter project, the BedJet system has undergone several iterations over the last decade. These days, the 3rd generation BedJet cooling system boasts the ability to instantly cool or warm your bed, prevent the icky nighttime sweat, and use remote or app-based control. But what else truly sets it apart from all the bed-related gadgets out there? What makes the BedJet Cooling System different One of the things that makes the BedJet system unique is that it doesn't just cool, but it uses technology to determine the best temperature for your body throughout the night. Because of this, you can enjoy science-backed, optimized temperature instead of a generic standard one. Plus, it has an added wake-up trigger feature, which helps signal your body to start the day in a less stressful way than an alarm clock. To support its claims, BedJet shares endorsements from board-certified sleep specialists. Although it's not meant to take the place of a full air conditioner or a proper room heater, there are a couple of key advantages to owning a BedJet cooling system. For example, instead of investing in separate heating or cooling blankets, you can stick to one for a year-round temperature control mechanism. In addition, it's a neat, localized way to manage temperature for people who have to share a bed, but don't have the same preferences with its BedJet Dual Zone. And of course, for people who love supporting local businesses, you'll be happy to know that BedJet isn't just based in Rhode Island, but it's also founded by an American engineer and used by some of the country's top athletes. Not to mention, the sleep technology company has made a commitment to giving back to the community with the Aramli Foundation, which has a list of local beneficiaries that include hospitals, churches, shelters, and community centers. What people have to say about the BedJet Cooling System On the official BedJet website, the American sleep brand shares that its BedJet cooling system has collectively garnered 4.7 stars from over 8,300 verified reviewers. While this is already a pretty high rating on its own, it also boasts that 83% of reviewers have even given it a perfect 5 stars, which inspires a lot of confidence. But what do reviewers on other third-party online retail platforms have to say about it? On Amazon, the BedJet 3 Sleep System has generated an average of 4.4 stars from more than 3,000 reviews. Although several users mentioned apprehensions with the product's price, many were pleasantly surprised at its performance and say they can't live without it after trying it out. In terms of in-depth reviews, an independent test by Country Living gave the sleeping technology product a pretty positive outlook, except for the fact that they thought it was both expensive and didn't look great. On the other hand, another independent review from Sleepopolis, which is known for testing hundreds of mattresses, has also given it an impressive 4.7 stars. Apart from citing the same concerns, they also mentioned concerns with the noise, which may or may not be an issue for you, depending on whether you love white noise or not. That said, if you don't have extra money to get the BedJet Cooling System, there are other gadgets that can keep the sweat away during the sweltering heat of summer."

In related news, a federal judge has conditionally certified a nationwide collective action in Mobley v. Workday, addressing claims that Workday's AI-based hiring tools systematically discriminate against applicants over the age of 40. Read on for a comprehensive review of these and other important developments. Regulatory, Legislative & Litigation Developments AI Moratorium Language in Budget Legislation Draws Criticism Hidden within the recent congressional budget legislation passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, known as the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" is a proposal that would impose a 10-year moratorium on state regulations governing artificial intelligence, adding complexity to the existing regulatory framework. Supporters argue that this moratorium will prevent hindrances to companies working in the fast-paced AI industry, which may be bogged down by a confusing and inconsistent set of state laws targeting similar regulatory concerns. Conversely, many members of Congress in both chambers, along with state lawmakers, have raised alarms that this moratorium would obstruct states from enacting vital regulations to protect their citizens, workforce, and consumers from the potential misuses of AI technology. Following approval in the House, the bill has moved to the Senate for further deliberation and amendment. An updated proposal ties certain federal broadband funding to adherence to the moratorium, with the Senate parliamentarian ruling that this adjustment allows the moratorium to comply with the Byrd Rule applicable to reconciliation, thus bringing the moratorium closer to realization.

mov_674DC792ECFF4344A3E3364C7B204038,2025-07-01 17:05:00,en,WEB,"  By Nate Raymond (Reuters) -A federal judge on Tuesday blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with plans to overhaul the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services by substantially cutting its workforce and shuttering entire agencies within the department. U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose in Providence, Rhode Island, issued an injunction at the behest of a group of Democratic-led states who challenged a plan HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr announced in March to consolidate agencies and fire 10,000 of the department's employees. The layoffs, in addition to earlier buyout offers and firings of probationary employees, reduced the number of full-time HHS employees to 62,000 from 82,000 and left key offices unable to perform statutory functions, the states alleged. As part of the restructuring plan, HHS said it was also collapsing 28 divisions into 15 and closing half of its 10 regional offices. After the announcement, employees at agencies under HHS including the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration were abruptly put on administrative leave on April 1 and told they would be formally terminated on June 2. Democratic attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed on May 5 argued that the intended effect of the restructuring was to dismantle key HHS programs. They argued Kennedy lacked the authority to launch the widespread layoffs and restructuring, which have led to infectious disease labs closures, research being abandoned and partnerships suspended. The states also argued the administration violated the U.S. Constitution by usurping Congress' authority to create and fund the agencies' operations. The job cuts and agency restructurings were carried out as part of the vast government cost-cutting initiative spearheaded by President Donald Trump's billionaire ally Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency. The states said the cuts left CDC unable to meet statutory mandates to investigate diseases due to lab closures, put Head Start centers that support early childhood programs at risk of closing, and had jeopardized work on mental health and addiction treatment. Their lawsuit said FDA after the job cuts also missed a deadline to approve a new vaccine for COVID-19 and canceled a key test for the bird flu virus.

A new report analyzing federal mortality data found that suicides involving firearms made up 58% of all gun deaths in 2023 — the latest year with available data. In total, 27,300 people died by gun suicide in 2023, according to the report from the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions and the Johns Hopkins Center for Suicide Prevention. The findings are based on finalized data from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In all, 46,728 people died from gun-related injuries in 2023, according to the CDC's Wonder database. Gun homicides fell for the second year in a row, dropping from 20,958 in 2021 to 19,651 in 2022 and 17,927 in 2023. Despite the decline, the 2023 total ranks as the fifth highest on record for gun homicides, according to the report. Rural, less populated states recorded the highest gun suicide rates in 2023. Wyoming led the nation with about 19.9 gun suicide deaths per 100,000 residents — nearly 10 times the rate of Massachusetts, which had the lowest at about 2.1 per 100,000. “People are just using guns when it comes to considering suicide because it's highly lethal and it's easily accessible,” said Rose Kim, the lead author of the report and the assistant policy adviser at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions. “That's really a deadly combination, and it's really driving the suicide epidemic in our country.” Suicide has remained the leading category of gun death in the U.S. for nearly three decades, according to the report. That trend has continued even as public attention and legislative action have largely focused on gun homicides and mass shootings. More than a handful of both Republican-led and Democratic-led states have passed or enacted new gun policies this year, ranging from permitless carry in North Carolina and a statewide ban on “red flag” or extreme risk protective orders in Texas to bans on assault-style weapons in Rhode Island to rapid-fire devices in Oregon. Recently, the Michigan Senate approved legislation that would ban bump stocks and ghost guns. In Washington state, a new law set to take effect in May 2027 will require prospective gun buyers to obtain a five-year permit through the Washington State Patrol. Alabama Republican Gov. Kay Ivey in March signed into law a bill that made Alabama the 26th state to outlaw gun conversion devices, also known as auto sears, which can turn semiautomatic firearms into fully automatic weapons. In April, she signed into law a measure that allows people experiencing suicidal thoughts to surrender a firearm to a licensed gun dealer. Kim said some state policies can help reduce gun deaths, such as safe storage laws, firearm purchaser licensing and extreme risk protection orders. “It's also important to recognize that there are public health interventions, evidence based, that can really address gun suicides and save lives,” she said in an interview. Men were nearly seven times more likely than women to die by gun suicide in 2023, according to the Johns Hopkins report. The highest rate of firearm suicide was among men 70 and older. For the fourth consecutive year, firearms remained the leading cause of death among youth under 17 in 2023, with 2,581 deaths recorded. Among young people aged 10 to 19, gun suicide totals remained relatively unchanged year over year — 1,252 in 2023 compared with 1,238 in 2022 — but racial and ethnic breakdowns showed stark disparities. Since 2014, the gun suicide rate for Black youth 10 to 19 had more than tripled, rising from 1 death per 100,000 people to 3.3 in 2023.

(AP) — A federal judge has ruled that the recent mass layoffs at the U.S. Health and Human Services were likely unlawful and ordered the Trump administration to halt plans to downsize and reorganize the nation's health workforce. U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose in Rhode Island granted the preliminary injunction sought by a coalition of attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia in a lawsuit filed in early May. DuBose said the states had shown “irreparable harm,” from the cuts and were likely to prevail in their claims that the “HHS's action was both arbitrary and capricious as well as contrary to law.” “The executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,” DuBose wrote in a 58-page order handed down in U.S. district court of Rhode Island. Her order blocks the Trump administration from finalizing layoffs announced in March or issuing any further firings. HHS is directed to file a status report by July 11. The ruling applies to terminated employees in four different divisions of HHS — the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the Center for Tobacco Products within the Food and Drug Administration; the Office of Head Start within the Administration for Children and Families and employees of regional offices who work on Head Start matters; and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. eliminated more than 10,000 employees in late March and consolidated 28 agencies to just 15. Combined with previous layoffs by President 's administration, about a quarter of the agency's workforce has been slashed, according to the lawsuit. The attorneys general argued that the massive restructuring was arbitrary and outside of the scope of the agency's authority. The lawsuit also says the action decimated essential programs and pushed burdensome costs onto states. “The intended effect … was the wholesale elimination of many HHS programs that are critical to public health and safety,” the lawsuit argued. The cuts are part of a federal “Make America Healthy Again” directive to streamline costly agencies and reduce redundancies. Kennedy told senators at a May 14 hearing that there is “so much chaos and disorganization"" at HHS. But the restructuring has eliminated key teams that regulate food safety and drugs, as well as support a wide range of programs for tobacco, HIV prevention and maternal and infant health. Kennedy has since said that because of mistakes, 20% of people fired might be reinstated. The states who joined the lawsuit have Democratic governors, and many of the same states — plus a few others — also sued the Trump administration over $11 billion in cuts to public health funding.

On Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Melissa DuBose in Providence, Rhode Island issued an injunction following a legal challenge from 19 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia. The states filed their lawsuit on May 5 against the restructuring plan announced in March by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. The blocked plan included firing 10,000 department employees and consolidating 28 divisions into 15. The administration also intended to close half of the department's 10 regional offices. According to the lawsuit, earlier buyout offers and firings of probationary employees had already reduced HHS full-time staff from 82,000 to 62,000. The states argued this reduction left key offices unable to perform their required functions. The Democratic attorneys general argued in their lawsuit that Kennedy lacked authority to implement such widespread layoffs and restructuring. They claimed the changes had already resulted in infectious disease labs closing, research being abandoned, and partnerships being suspended.

The city hasn't released the videos from the body-worn cameras that Letourneau and other officers wore, although the attorney general's office said it had no objection once all the witnesses were interviewed. They did not respond to a Globe request last week for just Letourneau's video, although it is clearly in the public's interest. The city also hasn't responded to a public-records request made two weeks ago for the police radio and dispatch calls from the shooting.

That's all he was doing,” Fontes said of Yidana, who is still hospitalized with a bullet wound to his shoulder . “[The officer] needs to be fired. If you're doing that, bro, what if it was a little kid?” Advertisement On Friday, nearly three weeks after the shooting, Fontes pointed to the bullet holes at the BVCAP building at 32 Goff Ave. and then across the intersection to Broad and Exchange streets, where he saw the officer pointing a gun from behind the door of his cruiser mid-morning on June 8. Investigators found multiple shell casings there, outside an optometrist's office. It was perhaps 150 feet away from where Yidana was shot, just outside Slater House, the apartment building at 10 Goff Ave. where he lived. Bullets also struck a vehicle parked nearby on Goff Avenue. “You're shooting from the intersection over there, but you only hit him one time,” Fontes said. “But everything else is going everywhere else.” The Slater house apartment building at 10 Goff Ave. in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Sebastian Yidana, a resident, was standing outside the building playing with a toy gun when he was shot by a Pawtucket police officer. Amanda Milkovits/Globe Staff In the days before he was shot, Yidana was often outside Slater House playing with the brightly colored camouflage, orange-tipped plastic gun. He told his mother that he'd bought it online and enjoyed the sounds it made. Yidana played with the toy so much that he'd already broken part of it, Fontes said. Other residents of Slater House could watch from the windows, and anyone passing by could see Yidana as he danced with the toy gun, pointed it at himself, and threw his hands in the air, Fontes and other witnesses said. Yidana was a familiar presence on the block, down the street from the train station and across from a high-rise for elderly residents, a bus stop and a Walgreens where people gathered to drink and smoke in the parking lot. “He's harmless,” Fontes said. “His mustache weighs more than him.” Police officers drove by often, occasionally stopping on calls. Yidana's mother said some of the officers knew her son, knew about about his disabilities and had gotten him help in the past. Fontes said he once saw officers with Yidana during an incident at the Walgreens, and he interrupted to tell them that Yidana had mental disabilities. Advertisement “They said, 'Mind your business. We know,'” Fontes recalled. On the morning of June 8, as an officer was checking on someone else at Slater House, another resident asked him to talk to Yidana, because he was worried that the toy gun could lead to trouble. The officer brushed it off, Fontes said. A little while later, Yidana went outside with his toy. Suddenly, Fontes said, he and his friend James Dean heard gunfire. Dean bolted outside first, his hands in the air, screaming at the police officer who was across the intersection pointing a gun at Yidana.

mov_DCADBEF656961BF33508CEE23405E612,2025-07-01 18:27:30,en,WEB,"  Washington — A federal judge in Rhode Island has blocked the Department of Health and Human Services from implementing mass layoffs and overhauling some of its sub-agencies, finding there to be ""no rational basis"" for the Trump administration's reorganization plans that would have ""devastating consequences"" across the country if enacted. The suit was brought by 19 Democratic attorneys general and Washington, D.C., in May, seeking to block an agency restructuring plan announced by HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. in March. Their complaint warned of ""severe, complicated, and potentially irreversible"" consequences to public health services nationwide if the plan went forward, potentially ""paralyzing"" the agency ""by means of a confusing reorganization."" ""Critical public health services have been interrupted, databases taken offline, status of grants thrown into chaos, technical assistance services gone, and training and consultation services curtailed. These are not unsubstantiated fears,"" Judge Melissa DuBose wrote in her opinion granting the states' request for a preliminary injunction. ""HHS has failed to produce a shred of evidence that services to States and access to critical information would continue uninterrupted, that the harms are minimal or not irreparable, or that it is authorized to act absent Congressional action,"" she added. The judge also ordered the parties to address whether and how the Supreme Court's recent ruling limiting universal injunctions should apply to her order. In that case, which stemmed from President Trump's attempt to end birthright citizenship, the Supreme Court limited the use of universal injunctions in cases with individuals as plaintiffs, but gave lower courts more latitude in cases brought by states. The states had cited concerns with the restructuring at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the FDA's tobacco products center, the Office of Head Start and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation. ""The Executive Branch does not have the authority to order, organize, or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,"" DuBose wrote. As part of Kennedy's restructuring plan, he moved to lay off some 10,000 employees at the nation's health agencies and ordered remaining officials to draw up plans to reorganize their work. Several offices and teams are slated to move under the plans, many into a new agency Kennedy wants to create called the Administration for a Healthy America, or AHA. Most of those employees remain off the job after getting their layoff notices in April but are still being paid, due to cases that sought to block their terminations. ""HHS is the backbone of our nation's public health and social safety net — from cancer screenings and maternal health to early childhood education and domestic violence prevention,"" said New York Attorney General James in a statement after the ruling. In May, a federal court in California blocked the Trump administration's mass layoff attempts, including at HHS, though the Supreme Court is considering whether to lift a lower court's injunction and allow it to move forward with the administration's plans for reductions in force, or layoffs. More in Politics ""The people who were subject to the reduction in force are on administrative leave, and they will remain on administrative leave until the injunction is lifted,"" Kennedy said at a House Energy and Commerce Committee hearing last week. Multiple federal health officials said planning has been ongoing for the next steps of the reorganization and merger, even as Kennedy has cited the court rulings as a reason to dodge questions about the restructuring on Capitol Hill. Officials from the Health Resources and Services Administration visited the CDC's campuses in Atlanta in recent weeks, they said, in a meeting of senior leaders between the two agencies. Most remaining teams focused on chronic disease from the two agencies are supposed to start being transferred into the new AHA agency, Kennedy has said, if the injunction is lifted. A few hundred layoffs have also been reversed in the weeks since the initial cuts, including those of scientists, researchers and health officials the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health and the FDA. But officials have also been told that further layoffs might be demanded by the Trump administration from health agencies in order to ""balance out"" the jobs that were restored. ""At that point, we will make decisions. And, you know, in some cases, there have been gaps in our ability to perform our duties. I've brought people back,"" Kennedy said.

mov_3BCF5078BF05D13E705C424CF0B18327,2025-07-01 18:28:23,en,WEB,"  Home Newsroom BOISE — Attorney General Raúl Labrador announced today that all 55 attorneys general, representing all eligible states and U.S. territories, agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family. The Sackler family has also informed the attorneys general of its plan to proceed with the settlement, which would resolve litigation against Purdue and the Sackler family for their role in creating and worsening the opioid crisis across the country. Idaho stands to receive up to $24 million over the next 15 years. “The companies responsible for driving the opioid crisis in our country are finally being held to account,” said Attorney General Labrador. “While these settlements cannot repair the broken lives and families, hopefully we can prevent the wreckage of future addiction with targeted investments in drug treatment and prevention efforts in Idaho.” Under the Sacklers' ownership, Purdue manufactured and aggressively marketed opioid products for decades, fueling the largest drug crisis in the nation's history. The settlement ends the Sacklers' control of Purdue and their ability to sell opioids in the United States. Communities across the country will directly receive funds over the next 15 years to support addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery. This settlement in principle is the nation's largest settlement to date with individuals responsible for the opioid crisis. Most of the settlement funds will be distributed in the first three years. The Sacklers will pay $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay roughly $900 million in the first payment, followed by $500 million after one year, an additional $500 million after two years, and $400 million after three years. Like prior opioid settlements, the settlement with Purdue and the Sacklers will involve resolution of legal claims by state and local governments. The local government sign-on and voting solicitation process for this settlement will be contingent on bankruptcy court approval. A hearing is scheduled on that matter in the coming days. Not including the Purdue and Sackler settlement, Attorney General Labrador has previously secured settlements totaling nearly $32 million in funds specifically for Idaho from companies that helped fuel the opioid epidemic, including Allergan, Kroger, Mylan, Teva Pharmaceutical, CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, and Walmart. Since taking office in 2023, Attorney General Labrador has obtained over $161 million in consumer protection settlements against companies for deceptive marketing and harmful products. Attorney General Labrador is joined in securing this settlement by the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, American Samoa, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Guam, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Northern Mariana Islands, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming."

mov_3AE696F661DE994AB40E02E37BB1B918,2025-07-01 18:45:00,en,WEB,"  NORTH CHARLESTON — As two of his siblings hid under a bed as their father allegedly shot the family dog, a young boy was able to escape and seek help, police say. The boy later told police his father, 30-year-old Chavas Lee Rhodes entered the apartment unit in the early morning hours of July 1 and told his son ""All of you are going to die,"" according to an incident report. Rhodes is charged with 11 criminal offenses including kidnapping, first-degree burglary, first-degree domestic violence and animal cruelty. In a packed morning bond hearing later in the morning of July 1, Rhodes' former partner spoke of the danger she and her three children feel. The three children she and Rhodes share, all 10 years or younger, are scared of their father. Magistrate Judge Amanda Haselden set a $360,000 total surety bond on eight charges but she denied bond on the burglary, kidnapping and domestic violence charges. Rhodes will remain in pre-trail detention until his first General Sessions court date, slated for mid-August. Attempted kidnapping Shortly before 1 a.m., Rhodes reportedly entered his ex-partner's apartment within the KRC Greenwood complex adjacent to Dorchester Road. The apartment door was unlocked, but Rhodes was legally barred from the home due to a no-contact order issued after a prior domestic violence assault. Rhodes first came upon his son and the family's chihuahua, Logan, who barked at Rhodes. The man trained a Glock at the small rat terrier mix and fired, the report states. Rhodes began calling out for his other two children, who'd been hiding under a bed in a back room. As he made his way through the apartment, Rhodes' son was able to slip out the front door to seek a neighbor's help. Rhodes found the hiding children. He covered their heads with a blanket and led them back through the apartment. But when a girl caught sight of Logan dead on the floor, she sank to the floor in tears. She adamantly told Rhodes she wouldn't go with him. The childrens' mother was in the parking lot when she got a call from one of her children who told her their dad was inside and had killed their dog, according to the police report. She ran upstairs to the apartment where Rhodes turned his gun on her. She pushed the weapon away. Thinking police were outside, Rhodes turned and ran out the back door and vaulted the balcony. As police searched for Rhodes, they stopped a rideshare driver in the area who'd allegedly been on the way to pick up Rhodes. Other officers tracked Rhodes with the help of a Dorchester County Sheriff's Office police dog. They also retraced Rhode's path to find a black Glock handgun and one of his children's cell phones in a bush. A bevy of priors Attorney Donna Taylor spoke on Rhodes' behalf. She said he'd been living in Goose Creek and was born there. Rhodes was an employee at Chucktown Mobile Seafood. Magistrate Judge Amanda Haselden granted bail on eight charges, but denied to set bail on three violent charges, against Chavas Lee Rhodes Tuesday, June 1. Caitlin Bell/Staff A victim's advocate spoke of how Rhodes traumatized all three of his children. ""The victim and her minor children are deathly terrified of Mr. Rhodes,"" said the victim's advocate. Rhodes has been charged with domestic violence in varying degrees five times prior to July 1, according to records from the State Law Enforcement Division. The victim's advocate advised the judge that several of these charges involved the current victim and her children. The most recent incident of domestic violence occurred in Lexington County in August 2022, according to court records. Rhodes pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of second-degree domestic violence. He was sentenced to a year of probation. In a May 2020 incident, Rhodes reportedly strangled the mother of his children unconscious and punched her multiple times in the face, according to an incident report. The pair's children were present in the motel room at the time. Police charged Rhodes with domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature. He pleaded to a reduced charge of second-degree domestic violence in early 2021. Rhodes was sentenced to time served and did not spend time in prison, according to court records. Rhodes' history was recounted at the bond hearing by a North Charleston police officer. ""This defendant is an extreme danger to the community,"" he said. The judge noted the severity of the allegations against Rhodes in denying bond on the three violent charges. She advised that he seek mental health and substance abuse treatment."

After about 10 days, she was moved to the neurologic step-down unit, which provides an intermediate level of care between the ICU and a general medical-surgical floor. In the step-down unit, she experienced awful hallucinations and delirium (temporary state of confusion). Relief came after several days courtesy of the palliative care team, which adjusted her medications until her symptoms eased. Liz spent just over a week in the step-down unit before being transferred to Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital Boston. As she discovered, she had a long road ahead. ""I was literally starting from the ground up,"" she said. ""I had physical therapy and rehabilitation as well as occupational, cognitive, and speech therapy. I had to relearn how to do everything from walking to matching colors and shapes."" After two weeks at Spaulding, Liz finally returned home. Her recovery continued with assistance from the Spaulding outpatient team, who worked with her on things like making sandwiches, improving her balance, and walking on a treadmill. She experienced both breakthroughs and painful setbacks. ""I broke down so many times because I wanted my brain to work, and it wouldn't cooperate,"" she said. ""I wish I could say I was happy just to be alive, but there was a lot of frustration and moments when I felt sorry for myself."" A question that stuck with her Weeks in bed had sapped Liz of most of the muscle she had gained from dancing, running, and lifting weights over the years. However, she was determined to walk again on the bike path near her home. Over time, she managed to get out there, accompanied by Mike or friends at first. Nearly three months after her surgery, Liz had a follow-up visit with Dr. Patel. She had no memory of him from her hospitalization and couldn't wait to meet him face to face. ""I wanted to give him a huge hug and thank him profusely,"" she said. ""He's such a kind, empathetic, and compassionate provider and human being."" Dr. Patel was also looking forward to seeing Liz. ""When I walked into the room, I remember thinking, 'Wow, what an amazing outcome,'"" he said. ""You can't even tell this woman had almost died."" Before the two had a chance to hug, Dr. Patel had a question for Liz: ""What are you going to do with your second chance at life?"" She's since put a lot of thought into that query. Ongoing neurological care Soon after Liz saw Dr. Patel, Dr. Smirnakis referred her to neurologist Samuel Snider, MD, for her ongoing care. During virtual and in-person visits, Dr. Snider performs tests to measure vision, cognition, strength, and more. Dr. Snider describes his role as a ""quarterback"" who coordinates various aspects of Liz's treatment and recovery. Managing medications for issues like seizures, mood, and fatigue is a key responsibility. ""My job is to support her with what she needs to get back to a level of function that she's happy with,"" he said. ""I'm trying to keep her safe without giving her any medications that will interfere with what she needs to do while reintegrating into her previous life."" ""He's incredible. I've never experienced a provider like him,"" Liz said. ""He'll answer the phone or reply to a text at any time of the day. He's dedicated and knowledgeable, and I feel very safe in his care."" A series of milestones capped by a marathon Within six months of her surgery, Liz achieved a series of impressive milestones. First, she got back to running. Then she received clearance to drive again. She also returned to her job, slowly ramping up to full-time, on-site work. The biggest milestone came just over a year post-surgery, when she and Mike were married in Providence, Rhode Island. But she wasn't done yet. After completing a 10-mile road race, Liz set her sights on the 2025 Boston Marathon. She had long dreamed of running Boston. When she got a runner's bib via a local charity, she decided to go for it. The day of the marathon featured gorgeous weather and an energetic, supportive crowd. Liz made it a point to soak it all in...."

mov_C3D5AD0E5312E13F86D471A3323CDE86,2025-07-01 19:02:09,en,WEB,"  A new law in Texas will require many popular products to have a label warning consumers that it contains ingredients “not recommended for human consumption.” It targets M&Ms, Doritos, Mountain Dew, and probably at least one of your grocery store guilty pleasures. The law, which was officially signed by Gov. Greg Abbott, requires any food containing one of more than 40 additives to include the label on its packaging by 2027. Here's a closer look at the additives in question, what nutritionists have to say about the MAHA-adjacent legislation, and more. What is Texas's food label law? The law aims to align the Lone Star State with the more cautious approach to processed food seen in Europe. There, food additives — like artificial dyes and preservatives — are strictly regulated. The label, which would be found up and down grocery-store aisles, would read: “WARNING: This product contains an ingredient that is not recommended for human consumption by the appropriate authority in Australia, Canada, the European Union, or the United Kingdom.” The hope is this will nudge manufacturers to strip their items of the additives. These ingredients, which slip through the cracks of a regulatory loophole, have become a priority of the “Make America Healthy Again” movement. Some major companies — from General Mills to Nestle — have already committed to removing dyes from their products, but the food industry is still pushing back against the law. “The ingredients used in the U.S. food supply are safe and have been rigorously studied following an objective science- and risk-based evaluation process,” the Consumer Brands Association trade group wrote in a letter to Abbott. “The labeling requirements of SB 25 mandate inaccurate warning language, create legal risks for brands and drive consumer confusion and higher costs.” The regulation would only apply to food labels “developed or copyrighted” on or after Jan. 1, 2027 — meaning that companies would only have to include the warning on food labels they've redesigned or updated, like when new ingredients are added, the Washington Post reports. In general, the move to pay closer attention to these ingredients has been applauded by experts, says Kathleen Melanson, a professor of nutrition at the University of Rhode Island. “Nutrition professionals and other health organizations have been advocating for more scrutiny of food additives for a long time,” she tells us. However, Dr. Melanson and others in her field say they're not quite sure how state legislators came up with their list of 44 ingredients. And there appear to be some discrepancies. The Associated Press reports that three of the additives — partially hydrogenated oils, Red Dye No. 4, and Red Dye No. 3 — have already been restricted in the U.S., and that some of the other ingredients are allowed in Australia, Canada, the E.U., or U.K. What additives are on the list? A whole range of artificial dyes are included, from Red No. 3 to Yellow No. 5, which have been controversial for some time. That's because they've been linked to hyperactivity and neurobehavioral issues in children and cancer risk. However, the research supporting this is limited, and some of it has only been proven in animals, Dr. Melanson says. There are several preservatives that have been blacklisted, like butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) and butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), which prevent fats in food from going bad. Both ingredients have also been linked to cancer — although, again, in studies on animals, not humans — and BHA is being reviewed in the E.U. for its potential to disrupt hormones. Emulsifiers (or chemicals that help water and oil blend), thickeners, and stabilizers also made the list. Some of these compounds, like propylene glycol, have been linked to allergic reactions and could worsen the symptoms of kidney and liver disease. More in Health You can see the full list of 44 additives that would get a warning label here. Dr. Melanson sees the focus on additives as a net positive, but she believes that the more important takeaway for consumers is to minimize the amount of ultra-processed foods in their diets. “Whether or not a food has a certain dye in it, the main focus should be on getting enough fiber, protein, and other nutrients you need from whole foods,” she says."
mov_56B53FF7CE74A318A85764DDB81D7980,2025-07-01 19:07:41,en,WEB,"  WASHINGTON (AP) — The sprawling Republican budget bill approved by the Senate Tuesday removes a proposed tax on solar and wind energy projects but quickly phases out tax credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy. The Senate approved the bill 51-50 as President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers move to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under former President Joe Biden. Vice President JD Vance broke a tie after three Republican senators voted no. The bill now moves to the House for final legislative approval. The excise tax on solar and wind generation projects was added to the Senate bill over the weekend, prompting bipartisan pushback from lawmakers as well as clean energy developers and advocates. The final bill removes the tax but mostly sticks with legislative language released late Friday night and would end incentives for clean energy sooner than a draft version unveiled two weeks ago. Some warn of spike in utility bills Democrats and environmental groups said the GOP plan would crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans' utility bills. The measure jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects slated to boost the nation's electric grid, they said. “Despite limited improvements, this legislation undermines the very foundation of America's manufacturing comeback and global energy leadership,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. If the bill becomes law, “families will face higher electric bills, factories will shut down, Americans will lose their jobs, and our electric grid will grow weaker,'' she said. The American Petroleum Institute, the top lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill's passage. “This historic legislation will help usher in a new era of energy dominance by unlocking opportunities for investment, opening lease sales and expanding access to oil and natural gas development,'' said Mike Sommers, the group's president and CEO. While Democrats complained that the bill would make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans said the measure represents historic savings for taxpayers and supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability. In a compromise approved overnight, the bill allows wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law's enactment to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,'' or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit. More in Politics The bill retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032. Changes to the renewable energy language — including removal of the excise tax on wind and solar — were negotiated by a group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Iowa Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley. Iowa is a top producer of wind power, while Murkowski is a longtime supporter of renewable energy as crucial for achieving energy independence, particularly for isolated rural communities in Alaska. Murkowski, who voted in favor of the final bill, called her decision-making process “agonizing.” “I had to look on balance, because the people in my state are the ones that I put first,” she told reporters after Tuesday's vote. “We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination.” GOP bill said to be 'massively destructive' Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called the bill a “massively destructive piece of legislation” that “increases costs for everyone by walloping the health care system, making families go hungry and sending utility bills through the roof.” The bill “saddles our children and grandchildren with trillions and trillions of dollars in debt — all to serve giant corporations, fossil fuel polluters and billionaire Republican megadonors who are already among the richest people on the planet,” Whitehouse said. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican and former chairman of the Senate Energy panel, hailed the bill for rescinding many elements of what he called the Biden administration's “green new scam,” including electric vehicle tax credits that have allowed car owners to lower the purchase price of EVs by $7,500. The bill also blocks a first-ever fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas production that industry groups fiercely opposed, increases oil and gas leases on public lands and revives coal leasing in Wyoming and other states. “Today, the Senate moved President Trump's agenda forward,'' said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican who chairs the Senate environment committee. Clean energy advocates were deeply disappointed by the bill, which they argue undoes much of the 2022 climate law approved by Democrats. “By eliminating a number of clean energy incentives and slashing others, this bill represents a significant step backward for America's energy future,” said Nathaniel Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit that seeks to accelerate the global transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. “Curtailing incentives for electricity generated from wind and solar power is particularly shortsighted'' and will raise energy prices for households and businesses and threaten reliability of the electric grid, Keohane said.

The lawsuit, filed Tuesday morning in the Northern District of California, argues the Trump administration's to the Department of Homeland Security illegally exposed confidential health information, including immigration status. The attorneys general are seeking to block Washington from using the information for immigration enforcement purposes or acquiring further Medicaid data. The case adds to the dozens of legal challenges Bonta's office has launched or joined against the Trump administration as the top California lawyer to the president. It also comes after over Los Angeles protests sparked by immigration raids, which prompted President Donald Trump to deploy the National Guard and Marines to the state against Gov. Gavin Newsom's wishes. AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement Bonta said the data seizure created “a culture of fear” that will have a “chilling effect” on health care access, particularly for immigrants and people seeking reproductive or gender-affirming care. “This isn't about cutting waste or going after fraud,” Bonta told reporters at a virtual press conference Tuesday. “This is about going after vulnerable people who entrusted the state and the federal government to help them access health care, a basic human right.” The Trump administration has argued the data-sharing maneuver was legal and will ensure Medicaid benefits are reserved for U.S. citizens. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The unprecedented data grab, , targeted residents of California, Illinois, Washington state and Washington, D.C., all of which offer public health insurance benefits for undocumented immigrants. It sparked outrage from Newsom, Democratic leaders from other states and data privacy advocates, who . AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement Approximately 78 million people nationwide are enrolled in Medicaid, . Around 1.7 million undocumented immigrants in California are enrolled in Medi-Cal, the state's implementation of Medicaid, which has been available to everyone in the state regardless of immigration status since 2024. Attorneys general from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington joined California in Tuesday's lawsuit, according to Bonta's office. The attorneys general allege the Trump administration's data transfer violates the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, better known as HIPAA, which bars providers from sharing protected health information without patient consent. They further claimed the data transfer runs afoul of privacy protections in four other federal laws as well as the U.S. Constitution's spending clause. Bonta said it's the latest example of Trump's “total disregard for the law.” AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement “We're taking the president to court again for the 28th time in 23 weeks — more than once a week — because that's how often he's breaking the law,” Bonta said.

Immigration officials have previously and to identify undocumented immigrants. It also comes amid a spike in ICE arrests as agents execute raids at schools, immigration courts and hardware stores. Trump has praised the agency for cracking down on illegal immigration, while Democrats have repudiated ICE's efforts as inhumane and blasted the agency for arresting people with no preexisting criminal record. “We need to call this what it really is: the latest salvo in the president's anti-immigrant campaign, an attack on public health and a breach of public trust that will have detrimental consequences for years to come,” Bonta said Tuesday.

mov_26F6CBF6FD90990A822FD88CC9D46205,2025-07-01 19:09:12,en,WEB,"  WASHINGTON (AP) — The sprawling Republican budget bill approved by the Senate Tuesday removes a proposed tax on solar and wind energy projects but quickly phases out tax credits for wind, solar and other renewable energy. The Senate approved the bill 51-50 as President Donald Trump and GOP lawmakers move to dismantle the 2022 climate law passed by Democrats under former President Joe Biden. Vice President JD Vance broke a tie after three Republican senators voted no. The bill now moves to the House for final legislative approval. The excise tax on solar and wind generation projects was added to the Senate bill over the weekend, prompting bipartisan pushback from lawmakers as well as clean energy developers and advocates. The final bill removes the tax but mostly sticks with legislative language released late Friday night and would end incentives for clean energy sooner than a draft version unveiled two weeks ago. Some warn of spike in utility bills Democrats and environmental groups said the GOP plan would crush growth in the wind and solar industry and lead to a spike in Americans' utility bills. The measure jeopardizes hundreds of renewable energy projects slated to boost the nation's electric grid, they said. “Despite limited improvements, this legislation undermines the very foundation of America's manufacturing comeback and global energy leadership,” said Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of the Solar Energy Industries Association. If the bill becomes law, “families will face higher electric bills, factories will shut down, Americans will lose their jobs, and our electric grid will grow weaker,'' she said. The American Petroleum Institute, the top lobbying group for the oil and gas industry, applauded the bill's passage. “This historic legislation will help usher in a new era of energy dominance by unlocking opportunities for investment, opening lease sales and expanding access to oil and natural gas development,'' said Mike Sommers, the group's president and CEO. While Democrats complained that the bill would make it harder to get renewable energy to the electric grid, Republicans said the measure represents historic savings for taxpayers and supports production of traditional energy sources such as oil, natural gas and coal, as well as nuclear power, increasing reliability. In a compromise approved overnight, the bill allows wind and solar projects that begin construction within a year of the law's enactment to get a full tax credit without a deadline for when the projects are “placed in service,'' or plugged into the grid. Wind and solar projects that begin later must be placed in service by the end of 2027 to get a credit. The bill retains incentives for technologies such as advanced nuclear, geothermal and hydropower through 2032. Changes to the renewable energy language — including removal of the excise tax on wind and solar — were negotiated by a group of Republican senators, including Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski and Iowa Sens. Joni Ernst and Chuck Grassley. Iowa is a top producer of wind power, while Murkowski is a longtime supporter of renewable energy as crucial for achieving energy independence, particularly for isolated rural communities in Alaska. Murkowski, who voted in favor of the final bill, called her decision-making process “agonizing.” “I had to look on balance, because the people in my state are the ones that I put first,” she told reporters after Tuesday's vote. “We do not have a perfect bill by any stretch of the imagination.” GOP bill said to be 'massively destructive' Rhode Island Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, called the bill a “massively destructive piece of legislation” that “increases costs for everyone by walloping the health care system, making families go hungry and sending utility bills through the roof.” The bill “saddles our children and grandchildren with trillions and trillions of dollars in debt — all to serve giant corporations, fossil fuel polluters and billionaire Republican megadonors who are already among the richest people on the planet,” Whitehouse said. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, a Republican and former chairman of the Senate Energy panel, hailed the bill for rescinding many elements of what he called the Biden administration's “green new scam,” including electric vehicle tax credits that have allowed car owners to lower the purchase price of EVs by $7,500. The bill also blocks a first-ever fee on excess methane emissions from oil and gas production that industry groups fiercely opposed, increases oil and gas leases on public lands and revives coal leasing in Wyoming and other states. “Today, the Senate moved President Trump's agenda forward,'' said West Virginia Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a Republican who chairs the Senate environment committee. Clean energy advocates were deeply disappointed by the bill, which they argue undoes much of the 2022 climate law approved by Democrats. “By eliminating a number of clean energy incentives and slashing others, this bill represents a significant step backward for America's energy future,” said Nathaniel Keohane, president of the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, a nonprofit that seeks to accelerate the global transition to net-zero greenhouse gas emissions. “Curtailing incentives for electricity generated from wind and solar power is particularly shortsighted'' and will raise energy prices for households and businesses and threaten reliability of the electric grid, Keohane said.

mov_9CE58AC7E8A4AFB53B7CEB09D1FCCB80,2025-07-01 19:42:00,en,WEB,"  BOISE — Attorney General Raúl Labrador announced today that all 55 attorneys general, representing all eligible states and U.S. territories, agreed to a $7.4 billion settlement with Purdue Pharma and its owners, the Sackler family. The Sackler family has also informed the attorneys general of its plan to proceed with the settlement, which would resolve litigation against Purdue and the Sackler family for their role in creating and worsening the opioid crisis across the country. Idaho stands to receive up to $24 million over the next 15 years. ""The companies responsible for driving the opioid crisis in our country are finally being held to account,"" said Attorney General Labrador. ""While these settlements cannot repair the broken lives and families, hopefully we can prevent the wreckage of future addiction with targeted investments in drug treatment and prevention efforts in Idaho."" Under the Sacklers' ownership, Purdue manufactured and aggressively marketed opioid products for decades, fueling the largest drug crisis in the nation's history. The settlement ends the Sacklers' control of Purdue and their ability to sell opioids in the United States. Communities across the country will directly receive funds over the next 15 years to support addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery. This settlement in principle is the nation's largest settlement to date with individuals responsible for the opioid crisis. Most of the settlement funds will be distributed in the first three years. The Sacklers will pay $1.5 billion and Purdue will pay roughly $900 million in the first payment, followed by $500 million after one year, an additional $500 million after two years, and $400 million after three years. Like prior opioid settlements, the settlement with Purdue and the Sacklers will involve resolution of legal claims by state and local governments. The local government sign-on and voting solicitation process for this settlement will be contingent on bankruptcy court approval. A hearing is scheduled on that matter in the coming days. Not including the Purdue and Sackler settlement, Attorney General Labrador has previously secured settlements totaling nearly $32 million in funds specifically for Idaho from companies that helped fuel the opioid epidemic, including Allergan, Kroger, Mylan, Teva Pharmaceutical, CVS Pharmacy, Walgreens, and Walmart. Since taking office in 2023, Attorney General Labrador has obtained over $161 million in consumer protection settlements against companies for deceptive marketing and harmful products. Attorney General Labrador is joined in securing this settlement by the attorneys general of Alabama, Alaska, American Samoa, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia, Guam, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, North Dakota, Northern Mariana Islands, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, U.S. Virgin Islands, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming."

Additionally, a federal judge has conditionally certified a nationwide collective action in Mobley v. Workday, related to claims that Workday's AI-based hiring tools discriminate against applicants older than 40. Continue reading for a detailed exploration of these critical updates. Regulatory, Legislative & Litigation Developments AI Moratorium Language in Budget Legislation Draws Criticism Nestled within the latest congressional budget bill passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, dubbed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" is a provision that would establish a 10-year moratorium on state regulation of artificial intelligence, complicating the current AI regulatory landscape. Proponents assert that the moratorium will prevent delays for companies engaged in the rapidly evolving AI sector, which could be hindered by a confusing and varied collection of state laws addressing similar issues. However, numerous members of Congress from both the House and the Senate, along with state lawmakers nationwide, have expressed concerns that the proposed ban on state AI regulation would inhibit states from passing essential regulations to safeguard their residents, workforce, and consumers against the misuse of AI technology. After its passage in the House, the bill has transitioned to the Senate, where it is currently being reviewed and amended. A revised version of the bill conditions certain federal broadband funding on compliance with the moratorium. The Senate parliamentarian has determined that this revision allows the moratorium to satisfy the Byrd Rule associated with reconciliation, moving the moratorium closer to implementation.

n0tfelj,2025-07-01 19:49:20,en,REDDIT,"  Yes. I keep saying this because for one thing I didn't grow up here. I've lived elsewhere and known people from (I always use the example of Pennsylvania). The farther west you go in the USA, the more of a ""social freeze."" In my opinion it starts with St. Louis and progresses west. I am not counting California, which has a different reputation--people saying ""let's do such-and-such"" and flaking. But Google ""Seattle Freeze"" and see what people say about how hard it is to break into social circles there. By contrast, if you've ever been to or known anyone from (again, I use the example of Pennsylvania) people are just more ""hail-fellow-well-met."" It's expected and natural that people strike up conversations with the whole community in a bar. I had the same experience in Providence, Rhode Island when we visited. You will be invited down the street to another bar with people you started talking to in the first bar. No one thinks a thing about it. I put it down to there being more people of Italian and other ""more talkative"" extractions in the East, and there being more people of Scandinavian (taciturn) extractions in the Upper Midwest. There's a chapter in the book _I Don't Care About Your Band_ where a woman from New York was sick of the dating scene there and met a man from Minneapolis who was PERFECT on paper. But when she met him he was such an extreme cold fish she couldn't hack it. He didn't even KNOW he was a cold fish. People from KC are not as cold of fishes as people from, say, Minneapolis or God Forbid, Seattle, have a reputation for, but they are colder fishes than they realize. People in KC will give you the shirt off their back. Just you TRY to have car trouble in KC without 1500 people stopping to risk their lives to help you. Just don't ask them to talk to someone they didn't arrive at the bar with. That's a bridge too far! I think they ""don't know"" it's ""acceptable."" They think it's ""weird."" It's not ""weird"" on the East Coast. It's a breath of fresh air. The first time I visited Chicago I was scared everyone would be very stuck-up to me because I am not real fashionable or skinny or good-looking and I have a Southern accent (I am leaving the South out of this social-friendliness discussion because it is a whole other kettle of fish, and social acceptance depends WAY too much in the South on who your family is)  now where was I. The first time I visited Chicago, I was totally surprised how friendly people were!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! People from St. Louis and points west just don't know they are colder fish than they think they are. I noticed in Denver, which in some ways you'd think would be a PARADISE, people were all in BAD MOODS! why?????????? Now I will say something nice about KC. Acceptance is not based on what you drive or what you are wearing. Can't say the same for SOME places. (Texas) (I've known people from KC move to Texas and move back saying it's too materialistic...and it is) But just you TRY to eat alone in Pittsburgh without someone starting a friendly conversation. I don't mean creepazoids trying to flirt. I mean the person at the next table going ""Yeah they need to trade (name of ballplayer) etc. etc. that sort of thing."

tw_sl_91bc7cd60a8d97615dcfadecac28f412,2025-07-01 20:07:09,en,WEB,"  JOHNSTON, R.I. – With the whirl of conveyor belts around him, Marc Delisca built a cardboard box and filled it up, placing smaller parcels inside. The package in Delisca's hands was somewhere around the midpoint of the order fulfillment process now in full swing inside Amazon's sprawling, 3.8-million-square-foot, five-story center in Johnston. From one end to another, the process spans a hybrid of robotic and human efforts. Automated machines deftly move products around the floor, while people pack bins and boxes, among other things. And while the $400 million facility first opened its doors to its now more than 1,500 full-time workers in October, site leader Sultan Kabiawu said the operation had reached what he considered “a new maturity point” by Tuesday morning. “We've grown to a point where we're able to serve the demand that we would like to serve in the local area,” Kabiawu said. Christopher Gavin/Globe Staff So set the backdrop of Tuesday's official ribbon cutting for the center – the end of a years-long effort to get the online retailer up and running off of Route 6, about eight miles west of downtown Providence. The location is prime for Amazon: Kabiawu said the site allowed the company to reduce the time it takes to get orders to customers – the latest piece in the retailer's regionalization strategy. The facility holds approximately 41 million items spanning the consumer spectrum, from toys and books to electronics and “everyday essentials,” he said. But local and state officials on hand Tuesday were also quick to point out a few other numbers. Thanks to a tax deal hammered out in 2021, the facility is expected to generate an average of $7.2 million a year in property taxes, or approximately $144 million over the next two decades. Amazon said, among other investments, it also pledged another $19 million for “local priorities, including education, public safety, youth sports, senior center, and municipal land trust.” The project is “the essence of what we do here in Johnston,” Johnston Mayor Joseph Polisena, Jr. said Tuesday. The town of nearly 30,000 people plays host to variety of major corporations: FM Global, the insurance company, is headquartered here. Citizens Bank boasts a 123-acre campus in town, too. “Here in Johnston, we have fully embraced our local, regional, and national transformation into a service economy,” Polisena said. “The premise we follow here is simple: The more commercial tax revenue you generate, the less you need to ask from your residents. That formula has worked for us, and it's honestly one that can work anywhere.” Christopher Gavin/Globe Staff Brad Griggs, who leads economic development for Amazon in New England, the mid-Atlantic region, and Canada, said the company is “proud to call Rhode Island home.” The facility picks, packs, and prepares packages for transport to sorting and logistics facilicites across the Northeast, he said. Construction on the center began in 2022, and according to Kabiawu, the facility is now fully staffed. Wages start at $20.50 per hour. Governor Dan McKee said Amazon has been “a great partner” for the state. “They're helping us with our small business transition into this world of [online] retail,” McKee said. More than 60 percent of Amazon sales are from independent sellers, most of them small- and medium-sized businesses, according to the company. In Rhode Island, those sellers averaged more than $160,000 in annual sales and sold more than 4 million items last year, Amazon said. Christopher Gavin/Globe Staff Among the local sellers is John Speights, owner of Cooper's Cask Coffee, based in East Greenwich. Speights, who previously had a 20-year career in tech, officially launched the business in 2015, after he began roasting coffee in a garage for fun, he said. These days, the business has a small staff: two-full time employees and five-part-time workers during the holiday season, he said. “Amazon has been huge for us.

mov_945843E2ADC5A81BC052E19B855FE293,2025-07-01 20:22:32,en,WEB,"  Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell joined 15 of her peers from across the country in a federal lawsuit Monday challenging the Department of Education for “illegally withholding congressionally approved funding for mental health programs in K-12 schools,” according to a statement from her office Tuesday. The Education department awards grants for five years and then makes yearly decisions to continue each grant's funding, the statement said. On April 29, the department sent “boilerplate notices” to grant recipients “claiming that their grants now conflicted with the Trump Administration's priorities and funding would be discontinued,” the statement said. A request for comment on the lawsuit was sent to the Education Department. The lawsuit, filed Monday in a federal court in Washington state, alleges that the funding cuts from the department “violate the Administrative Procedure Act and the U.S. Constitution,” the statement said. The lawsuit seeks to have a federal judge rule the funding cuts are illegal and grant an injunction to stop the cuts, according to the statement. Education in Massachusetts has seen $106 million in federal funding cuts under the Trump Administration, according to a state database. “As our young people face a nationwide mental health epidemic, it is critical to ensure they have access to the resources they need, including mental health professionals in schools,” Campbell said in the statement. “The Trump Administration does not have the power to arbitrarily revoke grant funding that provides critical mental health services to our students.” “I will continue to fight against unlawful federal actions that harm our children,” she said. Campbell signed the lawsuit with attorney generals from three other New England states: Connecticut, Maine, and Rhode Island. The remaining states are California, Colorado, Delaware, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin. The lawsuit names the Department of Education and Education Secretary Linda McMahon. Funds for Project Beacon, a University of Massachusetts Boston program that prepares 50 school psychologists and counselors to work in “local, high-need communities to increase students' access to educational services and to promote school safety through prevention,” will be cut, the statement said. The program works with public schools in Brockton, Lawrence, and Quincy. “Because of the termination of this program, thousands of low-income American students across several school districts in Greater Boston will lose the support of these psychologists and counselors in training,” the statement said. In April, Campbell sued the Trump Administration for cutting education funding that benefits low-income and unhoused students and those suffering long-term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. She also sued the administration to challenge an executive order for election restrictions."

mov_DBEEBA3E7787F3F6AFF35424451485FE,2025-07-01 21:10:33,en,WEB,"  Emil Wolferseder of Exeter pumps gas at the Mobil station on South County Trail in Exeter on Tuesday, July 1, 2025, the first day a 3-cent increase in Rhode Island's gas tax took effect. (Photo by Laura Paton/Rhode Island Current) You wouldn't know a contested hike in state taxes on fuel began Tuesday by scanning local gas stations. Average gas prices in Rhode Island dropped 1 cent per gallon from Monday, and were 2 cents less than the daily average in neighboring Massachusetts, according to AAA. Yet the extra 3-cents-per-gallon tax — bringing the per-gallon tax to 41 cents — drew sharp criticism from Gov. Dan McKee. The gas tax was already scheduled to rise by 1 cent per gallon, from 38 to 39 cents, on July 1 before the legislature stepped in to aid the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority (RIPTA). In a June 25 press conference, McKee blasted lawmakers for “unnecessary” tax and fee increases in the approved fiscal 2026 budget, including on gasoline. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi countered that the revenue from the extra tax on motorists was crucial to shoring up the state's cash-strapped public bus system. “RIPTA can't afford service cuts,” Shekarchi said in an interview Tuesday. “They're a lifeline for a lot of people.” But the road to fiscal solvency for RIPTA requires more than raising prices at the pump. Looking to close a remaining $10 million fiscal 2026 shortfall, RIPTA is eyeing service cuts and fare increases, with a series of public hearings starting July 28. Annual revenue from the state gas tax is already falling amid a rise in electric vehicles and a work-from-home culture that decenters driving. Transit advocates insist the state needs to look for alternative solutions. “The gas tax is a losing proposition when relying on it to fund transportation infrastructure or public transit because it's a melting ice cube,” said John Flaherty, senior adviser for Grow Smart RI. “The question is how to fund public transportation in a more stable and robust way, without there being a lot of pain and tradeoffs.” McKee says the pain has already begun. He insisted the hike in state gas taxes would hurt working families while putting Rhode Island “out of line” with neighboring states. Before Tuesday's increase, Rhode Island already ranked 14th among states for motor fuel taxes, according to the Tax Foundation. Massachusetts remains at 27 cents per gallon, while Connecticut sits at 52 cents per gallon, including a state excise tax and a separate, 8% wholesale tax on petroleum products. More in U.S. Flaherty acknowledged that Rhode Island's higher gas tax, compared with Massachusetts, might sway drivers to fill up across state lines. Others may not even notice. “Some people won't give it another thought, they just go where it's convenient,” Flaherty said. “Then you have people who have apps on their phone to check the price at every gas station.” Shekarchi is among the latter, favoring Harss gas station on Warwick Avenue in Warwick for its competitive prices. He was unsympathetic to McKee's declaration that raising gas taxes would hurt working families. “I drive down West Shore Road in Warwick and pass 10 gas stations,” Shekarchi said. “The cost varies by 10 to 12 cents, depending on where you go.” House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi, left, and Gov. Dan McKee, stand divided over an increase in the state gas tax that took effect July 1. (Photos by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current) Will motorists even notice? Compared with a new, $4 per person monthly fee on state health insurance premiums, the gas tax increase is not a noticeable burden for most people, said Michael DiBiase, president and CEO of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. The business-backed policy group typically opposes tax increases that could jeopardize the state's economic standing. But DiBiase supported the move to raise gas taxes to create a sustainable revenue source for transportation — something the state has been sorely lacking. In the fiscal 2025 budget, lawmakers used one-time federal pandemic aid to help RIPTA fill its deficit, making a return to the table inevitable. The gas tax is a losing proposition when relying on it to fund transportation infrastructure or public transit because it's a melting ice cube. – John Flaherty, senior adviser for Grow Smart RI Throughout the 2025 session, lawmakers considered a host of ideas for more alternative RIPTA funding sources — a straight allocation of general revenue, money from fees on rideshare companies, a mileage-based user fee, and a greater share of the state gas tax. Lawmakers last updated the state's century-old gas tax in 2014, calling for a biennial adjustment in the per-gallon rate based on the Consumer Price Index. But subsequent adjustments only considered inflation from the year immediately prior, rather than the two prior years. Sen. Samuel Zurier, a Providence Democrat, introduced legislation to ensure that the two prior years are included in biennial inflation adjustments. Zurier's bill failed to advance out of committee, but he viewed the budget provision increasing the gas tax for RIPTA's benefit as achieving the same goal. Zurier sponsored a second bill, which also stalled in committee, to increase RIPTA's share of gas tax revenue. A short history of the gas tax Money from the motor fuel tax has historically been divided across a host of state agencies and programs. More than half of funds go to the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, with a 27% share to RIPTA. Other beneficiaries include the Rhode Island Bridge and Turnpike Authority, the Office of Healthy Aging, and the Underground Storage Review Board, which receives half of a 1 cent-per-gallon environmental fee tacked on to state gas charges to address underground storage tank leaks. The other half of the 1-cent environmental fee has gone to RIPTA since 2009. A portion of the gas tax revenue is also used to pay down debt service on state transportation bonds backed by future federal highway funding...."

Eyalet yönetimi tarafından yapılan basın açıklamasına göre, bu tarihi bir gelişme olup, eyaletin emniyet ve asayiş hizmetlerinin modernizasyonuna yönelik kararlılığını bir kez daha göstermektedir. Uzun yıllardır hizmet veren Umut Vadi Kışlası, doğal yıpranma ve günümüzdeki modern operasyonel ihtiyaçları karşılama konusundaki yetersizlikleri nedeniyle yeniden yapılandırma gereksinimini ortaya koymuştu. Yapılan bu yatırım, Rhode Island Eyaleti Polis Teşkilatı'nın (Rhode Island State Police) hem personelinin çalışma koşullarını iyileştirmeyi hem de halka daha etkin ve hızlı hizmet sunabilmesini amaçlamaktadır. Yeni Umut Vadi Kışlası'nın inşası, eyaletin halk sağlığı, kamu güvenliği ve acil durum müdahale kapasitesini güçlendirecek kapsamlı bir projenin parçasıdır. Bu modern tesis, en son teknolojiyle donatılacak olup, polis memurlarının görevlerini daha verimli bir şekilde yerine getirmeleri için gerekli tüm imkanları sağlayacaktır. Beklentiler arasında, gelişmiş iletişim sistemleri, daha geniş ve modern ofis alanları, eğitim olanakları ve personel dinlenme ve refah alanlarının iyileştirilmesi yer almaktadır. Rhode Island Eyaleti yetkilileri, bu projenin sadece bir bina inşası olmadığını, aynı zamanda eyaletin kamu güvenliği altyapısına yapılan stratejik bir yatırım olduğunu vurguluyor. Yeni kışla, yerel toplulukların güvenliğini sağlamak, suçla mücadele etmek ve acil durumlara daha hızlı ve etkili bir şekilde müdahale etmek için Eyalet Polisi'nin operasyonel kabiliyetini önemli ölçüde artıracaktır. Bu önemli gelişme, Umut Vadi ve çevresindeki topluluklar için de olumlu yansımalar yapacaktır. Yerel polis varlığının güçlenmesi ve daha modern bir karakolun hizmete girmesi, hem suç oranlarının azaltılmasına hem de vatandaşların kendilerini daha güvende hissetmelerine katkı sağlayacaktır. Projenin detayları ve inşaat takvimi hakkında önümüzdeki günlerde daha fazla bilgi paylaşılması beklenmektedir. Ancak şimdiden, Umut Vadi Kışlası'nın yeniden inşasının, Rhode Island halkının güvenliği ve refahı için atılmış önemli ve ileriye dönük bir adım olduğu açıktır.

mov_8D6E5F46B2D1E8223E666BAD75412B66,2025-07-01 22:16:26,en,WEB,"  ABSTRACT A 30-year veteran of the Providence Police Department writes: Police officials gave us a powerful reminder of what can go wrong when insiders make decisions designed to protect their own FULL TEXT Link to Image As a 30 year member of the Providence Police Department and a legislator who has served 14 years in the Rhode Island General Assembly, I applaud Steph Machado's reporting on the ruling of a three-member police review panel in the case of Providence Police Sergeant Joseph Hanley (""Providence sergeant who beat handcuffed man in 2020 will be returned to active duty."") This was a terrible decision, but it was hopefully the last gasp of an antiquated, failed approach to confronting police misconduct cases. In deciding this final case under the old Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights (LEOBOR) process, Cranston Police Major Todd Patalano and retired Providence Police Sergeant Robert Boehm, former head of the Providence Police union, gave us a powerful reminder of what can go wrong when insiders make decisions designed to protect their own, rather than prioritizing what is best for the community. In a 2-1 ruling, these panel members voted to suspend Sgt. Hanley for 45 days without pay instead of firing him, essentially saddling the department with an officer the panel unanimously agreed had violated Providence's use-of-force policy four separate times when he kicked and stood on the legs of a Black man already in handcuffs and uttered profanities at him while doing so. The testimony of other officers on the scene and their body camera footage made it difficult for members of the panel to ignore the violence Sgt. Hanley engaged in. (Although it should be noted Sgt. Hanley's own body camera footage was unavailable, as he violated policy by never turning it on, then claimed it somehow ""flew off"" at some point in the process.) Unfortunately, Major Patalano and Sgt. Boehm were content to explain away his bad behavior when it came time to hold Sgt. Hanley accountable for his actions. They railed against the alleged politics that drove Providence city officials to want to fire someone who engaged in violent behavior, apparently believing it was wrong to recognize the public demand for accountable policing in communities across the country after the murder of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minnesota. They angrily denied Sgt. Hanley's no contest plea of simple assault in the case was an admission of guilt, even though it constituted an agreement that the facts of the case were ""substantially true"" and came after a district court judge found him guilty of simple assault in the case, only to have that case result in a mistrial when an appeal was made in Superior Court. And they took particular exception to their fellow panel member, Providence Commander Timothy O'Hara, having the audacity to offer a vigorous dissenting opinion, where he suggested Sgt. Hanley should be fired for his actions-a position shared by the current and previous Providence Police Chief. It is worth noting here that Commander O'Hara is the only member of the panel who will have to work with Sgt. Hanley again and manage the other Providence officers that will have to serve with him, negotiating the legitimate concerns that come with having someone who has engaged in this kind of violence back on the streets and representing the department. It's ironic that for all these objections that Sgt. Hanley's advocates on the LEOBOR panel made about political motivations and how this process worked, they are the ones who gamed the system to get the outcome they wanted. They knew a new process was taking effect that would do away with the LEOBOR panel, where the accused individual facing the tribunal had a say who would be on it. They knew that under the LEOBOR system, Sgt. Hanley's no contest plea would keep the matter a misdemeanor. They knew they had to get their ruling in before a new system kicked in that would replace the LEOBOR panel with three officers randomly selected from a list, along with two civilians-a retired judge and an attorney-each selected by the chief justice of the Rhode Island Supreme Court. While there is reason to believe this new review process created by the Law Enforcement Officers' Due Process, Accountability and Transparency Act will produce more careful, reasonable outcomes that better serve the public interest, the damage done by the decision in Sgt. Hanley's hearing will harm the Providence Police Department for some time to come. It is my hope that Providence Mayor Brett Smiley will appeal this final flawed outcome under the LEOBOR process and even consider seeking an Ethics Commission review of the matter, as Major Patalano is also a Rhode Island State Senator who should have sought an ethics ruling on whether his participation on this panel was a potential conflict of interest. There are those who are happy to decry legitimate efforts to hold police officers accountable for the public work they do as being politically motivated or caving to public pressure. The fact is, with a review process that refuses to hold violent officers accountable for their actions, we threaten to destroy public trust in police officers who do their job the right way and we make their essential work more difficult. It is my hope our new approach in Rhode Island will avoid the mistakes and tone-deaf arguments made in this case and ensure that a range of voices and perspectives will act to promote effective policing that is positively engaged with our communities. State Representative Raymond A. Hull (D-6, North Providence, Providence) is a Deputy Speaker and currently serves as the commanding officer of the Housing Unit in the Providence Police Department."

Attorney General Phil Weiser and his counterparts in 19 states are suing the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, according to a news release issued by his office. The attorneys general said the mass transfer of the data violates the law and asked the court to block any new transfer or use of this data for immigration enforcement purposes. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. “The personal health care data collected about Medicaid beneficiaries is confidential, to be shared only in narrow circumstances that benefit public health and the integrity of the Medicaid program,” said Weiser, a Democrat. “There's no reason to share this sensitive data with immigration or law enforcement agencies. We're suing to protect Colorado's Medicaid program and the health and welfare of the people it serves.” In early June, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that administers the nation's health program for low-income Americans, made a “lengthy and detailed” data request to Colorado's agency that administers Medicaid, according to Marc Williams,  public information officer with the Department of Health Care Policy and Financing. The request was made to seven other states, he said, without providing details on which ones. The Associated Press reported CMS has shared personal information of Medicaid from people living in California, Illinois, Washington state and Washington D.C., with the Department of Homeland Security, the agency in charge of immigration enforcement and the administration's deportation push. In response, advocacy groups in Colorado raised a variety of privacy, safety and health concerns. An HHS spokesperson told CPR last month the request was within the agency's authority. “HHS and CMS take the integrity of the Medicaid program and the protection of American taxpayer dollars extremely seriously,” said U.S. Health and Human Services spokesperson Andrew Nixon, in an email. “With respect to the recent data sharing between CMS and DHS, HHS acted entirely within its legal authority – and in full compliance with all applicable laws – to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them.” “Colorado's immigrant communities should never have to fear that accessing life-saving care could lead to detention or deportation,” said Nicole Cervera Loy, Policy and Campaign Manager at the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition, in an email to CPR. “This unprecedented request for sensitive health data is not about program integrity—it's about surveillance and punishment. We call on state leaders to reject this directive and uphold Colorado's values of dignity, safety, and care for all.” The coalition highlighted in the suit that “the Trump administration's illegal actions are creating fear and confusion that will lead noncitizens and their family members to unenroll, or refuse to enroll, in emergency Medicaid for which they are otherwise eligible, leaving states and their safety net hospitals to foot the bill for federally mandated emergency healthcare services,” according a news release from the Attorney General's Office. Colorado joined the following states in the legal challenge: Arizona, California, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

Aunque es común ver cielos iluminados por explosiones pirotécnicas en la víspera del Día de la Independencia, las leyes que permiten, restringen o prohíben estos artefactos varían ampliamente entre estados, condados y ciudades.

The now-removed tax had only been added to the bill Friday, and it immediately sparked a wave of protest from unions, researchers, clean energy advocates and even Elon Musk. Experts argued that it would raise prices for electricity across America, damaging a clean energy industry already getting shellacked by the loss of various tax credits in the bill. The cuts to credits remained in the bill's text Tuesday, and Vice President J.D. Vance provided the tie-breaking vote to send the bill back to the House of Representatives. Republican Sens. Joni Ernst of Iowa, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Chuck Grassley of Iowa negotiated the tax's removal, per Politico. June 30, 5:50 p.m. California is in the middle of a reckoning over its sky-high electricity prices, with the Legislature and Gov. Gavin Newsom each pushing efforts to cut residents' expensive bills. But there is nothing Sacramento can do about a new bombshell from Senate Republicans in Washington: a tax on solar and wind projects that experts say will drive up Californians' energy prices. On Friday, one week before President Donald Trump's self-imposed deadline for signing his ""One Big, Beautiful Bill Act,"" Senate Republicans released a fresh version of the bill that includes the new tax, which would hit any new solar and wind facilities that include materials or design from a ""prohibited foreign entity"" like China. The bill already had language stripping away federal incentives for renewable energy, as SFGATE reported, but the quiet Friday change put Trump and his party even more firmly on the attack. The move, critics say, is sure to raise energy prices nationwide. Those critics are plentiful. Several Democratic senators lambasted the plan on Sunday during a debate period for the bill. Even a few Republican senators appear to be pushing back. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's policy head, Neil Bradley, said on X that he supports the bill but that the new provision would increase energy prices and should be removed. Unions like International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers and North America's Building Trades Union blasted the legislation for damaging the country's infrastructure ambitions, with the latter group writing, ""If enacted, this stands to be the biggest job-killing bill in the history of this country."" On X, Tesla CEO Elon Musk called the anti-renewables tax ""utter madness,"" and wrote that it ""gives handouts to industries of the past while severely damaging industries of the future."" (The bill includes a new subsidy for metallurgical coal.) It's the latest of a few episodes that have seen Musk skewer Trump's landmark bill, in defiance of their formerly close relationship. Why would the tax raise California's energy prices? It's a matter of supply and demand, largely related to a nascent tech boom. The massive data centers that train and run artificial intelligence are currently driving up energy demand. In an ideal world, these buildings would be fueled by cheaply produced electricity, stored in batteries to prevent even tiny outages. That's the exact type of facility, often known as ""solar plus storage,"" that's currently blooming across America - but that would be hugely disincentivized under Trump's new scheme. As more data centers are built, then, America's main source of new, cheap power would no longer be growing as steadily alongside them. California's high energy costs are largely related to an overhaul of the state's electrical infrastructure to prevent wildfires, but a slowdown on new solar and battery projects could compound some residents' price woes. The new tax would raise costs for building solar and wind projects by 10% to 20%, according to estimates from research firm Rhodium Group and prominent Princeton energy researcher Jesse Jenkins. The San Francisco think tank Energy Innovation, which focuses on climate policy, analyzed the bill before the new excise tax was added and helped CNN publish an estimate that California's energy prices would be 11% higher with the bill than without it. It's also projecting that the bill will cause hundreds of thousands of job losses. Republicans have a few reasons for pushing cuts to green energy credits and the new tax. Their legislation would add trillions of dollars to the national debt, and they see axing credits for wind and solar as a handy money-saver. Energy Secretary Chris Wright touted those savings in an op-ed for the New York Post on Friday, in which he called the renewable subsidies ""wasteful and counterproductive."" Trump is a longtime hater of wind and solar power, and he has seemed to never quite understand the recent transformative cost savings of building and storing solar. In a Sunday interview with Fox News, he said: ""I don't want windmills destroying our place. I don't want these solar things where they go for miles and they cover up a half a mountain and they're ugly as hell."" Various Democrats, including Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island and Brian Schatz of Hawaii, tried to get some points through to their colleagues about the bill's anti-renewables provisions on the Senate floor on Sunday. Whitehouse pointed to Texas, where a huge buildup of solar energy over the past few years has pushed down energy prices. Schatz discussed the rising demand for electricity, mainly from data centers, and framed renewables as the ideal solution. Of solar and battery storage, he said, ""It's growing, it's cheap, it works."" ""People voted for Donald Trump for all sorts of reasons,"" Schatz said. ""But no one voted for higher energy bills.""

""Tough would be a good word to use, "" said Meador, who officially retired as the WVU men's hoops Head Athletic Trainer on Monday. ""You'd walk into the coach's office and they would say, 'Here comes the bearer of bad news, ' things like that. Yeah, there were definitely tough situations you had to deal with when it came to injuries and whether or not guys could play."" But here's the thing, that was just one aspect to Meador's journey at WVU, a small one at that. Nicknamed ""Doc "" by the coaches and players, Meador's 41 years at the school represents some of the most fascinating eras in the athletic department's history, from the old Atlantic 10 days through the Big East and Big 12 and from Gale Catlett to John Beilein to Bob Huggins and beyond. ""The travel and locations definitely come to mind, "" he said. ""I remember those old locations in the Atlantic 10 in places like Rhode Island and St. Bonaventure. Then you move to the Big East and then the Big 12. ""It's really amazing how much has changed over the years. When I first began, there was no way you'd think college athletes would be getting paid by the schools. Now, they're getting paid and they're getting NIL. It's like the whole face of college athletics changed right in front of me."" ""How's Doc doing ?"" Truck Bryant is quick to recall Meador as ""one of the guys."" ""The relationship players had with Doc was great, but it was different, "" said Bryant, a WVU standout from 2008-2012. ""Spending time with Doc meant something bad had happened. You pulled a hamstring or twisted your ankle. You never got to hang out with him over good news. ""But, I'll say this: Doc did an amazing job of taking care of the players and he gave WVU everything he had. He was just as much a part of the team as anyone else."" It was that camaraderie that made the job less of a job for Meador. ""Guys came to me broken, "" he said. ""That's kind of a bad way to put it, but I understood that no one really wanted to see me. ""Then you start putting the pieces back together. That was my job. You'd put in long hours with players. You get to know them and know who they are and then you play a part in them getting back on the floor and helping them get back to realizing their dreams. That's the most satisfying feeling."" That feeling never diminished over 41 years, even as his list of patients continued to grow season after season. ""I can't tell you how many times former players come back to town for a visit and one of the first things they ask is, 'How's Doc doing ?' "" said Bryan Messerly, the sports communications director for WVU men's basketball who spent 25 years working with Meador. ""I think he's built extremely good relationships with players and coaches over the years. He's earned a lot of respect."" That respect was built from Meador going above and beyond just simply being the guy to tape up a sore ankle or wrapping up a tight hamstring. A great example may have come in the days before WVU played in the 2010 Final Four. Bryant had broken the fifth metatarsal bone in his right foot the week before and surgery required screws being inserted into his foot to hold the bone in place. In the days before the Mountaineers traveled to Indianapolis to face Duke, Meador was driving to North Carolina to meet with specialists who had developed a prosthesis that may have helped Bryant play in the Final Four. ""It ended up not being exactly what we needed, "" Meador said. ""That one was tough. We tried everything we could to get Truck back out on the floor, but we just couldn't get that one to go."" Bryant missed out on the Final Four, but came back healthy for his junior and senior seasons and then a nine-year pro career overseas. ""To me, I would trace my ability to play nine years professionally back to Doc, "" Bryant said. ""The work we did in rehab is what allowed me to keep going. ""Even when I was playing professionally, I'd still come back to see Doc. If it was something to do with treatment, I'd go to Doc and he always welcomed me with open arms."" An extended stay A native of Oxford, Ohio, Meador first came to Morgantown for a year of graduate school at WVU. ""My wife tells me all the time how I'd told her one year in Morgantown and then we would head back to Ohio, "" Meador said. ""That was 41 years ago. We enjoyed it here...."

The number of residents age 65 years and older in the Myrtle Beach metropolitan area grew by 6.3% last year, making it the fastest-growing metro area for senior citizens in the U.S., according to population estimates the U.S. Census Bureau released last week. During the 2020s, Myrtle Beach's senior population has grown by more than 22%, also the fastest rate in the United States this decade. Senior citizens now make up more than a quarter of the around 413,000 residents in metro Myrtle Beach, which once was known for being a budget beach destination. The community with a mile-long boardwalk and 200-foot Ferris wheel used to attract biker rallies which the city tried to end in the late 2000s because of the noise, traffic and rowdiness. But now the noisy streets have had to make room for quiet diners and pickleball courts. The COVID-19 pandemic played a role in the area's senior boom as people in such places as Ohio and New York who had been vacationing for years in Myrtle Beach realized they could retire early or work from home anywhere, said Mark Kruea, a longtime public information officer for Myrtle Beach who is now running to be mayor. “Many people converted that thought into action,” Kruea said. “The climate's great, taxes are low, there's a wealth of opportunities for recreation, dining and shopping.” A graying United States The U.S. population age 65 and older rose by 3.1% last year, while the population under age 18 decreased by 0.2%.

With homestead and a small Veteran's exemption we cut our property taxes in nearly 1/2. If Governor Desantis thinks he can replace property tax revenue with revenue from the tourist industry and continuing to tax non homesteaders, those that work in the various tourist service industries need to be able to afford to live in Florida. Even without having the burden of paying property taxes, Florida's still high home prices and high home owner's insurance rates makes it difficult for a 1st time buyer to afford a home in Florida or afford to pay rent on a decent apartment. It will be interesting to see how this unfolds."

This eye-opening map breaks it down for us, showcasing the top-earning companies headquartered in each U.S. state. The results reveal fascinating insights into the economic engines that power different regions of America. Let's start with the giant at the center of it all: Walmart in Arkansas, generating an eye-popping $486 billion in annual revenue. That is more than the GDP of many countries. The retail titan not only dominates its state but stands as the largest company in the entire nation by revenue. Texas is home to ExxonMobil, pulling in $226 billion annually. It reflects Texas's historic and ongoing importance in the global energy sector. In California, Apple tops the list with $216 billion, reinforcing its role as the crown jewel of Silicon Valley and a global leader in innovation, design, and consumer electronics. In Nebraska, Berkshire Hathaway claims the top spot with $224 billion in revenue. Warren Buffett's investment conglomerate exemplifies strategic diversification across insurance, railroads, utilities, and consumer goods. Washington is powered by Amazon, earning $136 billion (1P etc). Its influence on retail, logistics, cloud computing, and entertainment is reshaping industries around the globe. CVS Health in Rhode Island, with $132 billion in revenue, illustrates the sheer scale of the healthcare and pharmacy sector in America. Similarly, UnitedHealth Group leads Minnesota with $185 billion, a figure that highlights the importance of insurance and managed healthcare. In Michigan, General Motors brings in $166 billion, maintaining the state's long-standing automotive legacy. Nevada's top company is Las Vegas Sands Corp. with $12 billion, representing the entertainment and casino industry's financial might. In Virginia, Mars Inc. leads with $45 billion, reminding us that iconic candy brands can also generate enormous business returns. Tennessee is powered by FedEx with $50 billion, reinforcing its position as a global logistics leader. Georgia is home to The Home Depot, bringing in $88 billion, underlining the strength of the home improvement sector. These companies are more than revenue generators. They are job creators, innovation drivers, and global influencers. They help shape consumer behavior, environmental impact, public policy, and international business dynamics.

74231B9A9C6FF7B5CE507CA15CCD9020,2025-07-02 08:15:34,en,PRINT,"  In an order on Tuesday, a judge found the Trump administration's plans to drastically change the structure and mission of the Department of Health and Human Services was probably unlawful. A federal judge on Tuesday temporarily blocked the Trump administration from moving forward with a dramatic reorganization of the Department of Health and Human Services, finding that the mass firings and organizational changes were probably unlawful. In an opinion accompanying the order, Judge Melissa R. DuBose of the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island said that Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s efforts to wipe out entire programs and reorient the agency's priorities and work far exceeded his authority. ''The executive branch does not have the authority to order, organize or implement wholesale changes to the structure and function of the agencies created by Congress,'' she wrote. A coalition of 19 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia had banded together in a lawsuit led by Letitia James, the New York attorney general, seeking to reverse Mr. Kennedy's plan to cut 10,000 federal health workers after mass layoffs began in April. The lawsuit also challenged his reorganization of the sprawling department, which included paring down 28 federal divisions to 15. The layoffs and restructuring effectively eliminated programs that assisted local officials with a variety of public health issues ranging from testing for sexually transmitted diseases to anti-smoking campaigns to lead-poisoning outbreaks, the states contended, resulting in the loss of critical services almost overnight. In her order, Judge DuBose, an appointee of President Joseph R. Biden Jr., laid out a withering civics lesson, offering the government ''a brief reminder about the bedrock doctrine of separation of powers that governs the relationship between the United States.'' She added that the changes at the agency would have knock-on effects for the entire country, and that the Constitution expressly prevented someone in Mr. Kennedy's position from attempting such a ''concentration of power in one part of the government.'' In recent testimony to Congress, Mr. Kennedy said that more than 700 staff members from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention who had been let go had since been brought back. It is unclear how many of the public health gaps described by states in the litigation remain unaddressed. Andrew Nixon, a spokesman for Mr. Kennedy, said on Tuesday that the agency stood by its ''decision to realign this organization with its core mission and refocus a sprawling bureaucracy that, over time, had become wasteful, inefficient and resistant to change.'' He said the reorganization was meant to help the department reverse chronic disease and advance U.S. leadership in biomedical research. The agency is reviewing the court's decision and considering next steps, he added. Ms. James applauded the judge's order as relief, however temporary, for ''our most vulnerable communities.'' ''H.H.S. is the backbone of our nation's public health and social safety net -- from cancer screenings and maternal health to early childhood education and domestic violence prevention,'' she said in a statement. '' Today's order guarantees these programs and services will remain accessible and halts the administration's attempt to sabotage our nation's health care system.'' Shortly after taking office, President Trump ordered nearly every agency to undergo a drastic overhaul and present plans for large-scale layoffs. During a court hearing in May, Molly Thomas-Jensen, an attorney with the New York Attorney General's Office, outlined some of the services that were cut as a result of Mr. Kennedy's efforts to follow that directive, including screening for hearing loss in newborns, tracking of maternal mortality and testing for sexually transmitted diseases. ''Secretary Kennedy has admitted that performing a careful review of job responsibilities before laying off 10,000 employees would have taken too long and would have resulted in a loss of political momentum,'' Ms. Thomas-Jensen said. '' He also conceded that he believed that 20 percent of these layoffs would be mistakes, and that that was always the plan.'' Elizabeth Hedges, a lawyer for the Justice Department, argued that the agency was working within its discretion to get rid of redundant functions. ''As an executive agency, it has to have some authority to order its affairs,'' Ms. Hedges said. She said many of the harms that states outlined were hypothetical and not imminent. She also argued that the changes to the department were not finalized, and therefore could not be challenged yet. State and federal officials submitted declarations describing the effect of the cuts that were evident in May. A Wisconsin official said that leaders of Milwaukee Public Schools discovered flaking lead paint and lead dust in school buildings -- and children with elevated blood-lead levels. When they turned to the C.D.C. for help, the agency ''declined the request due to the April 1 staff cuts,'' the declaration said. Other states also detailed the shuttering of the C.D.C.'s lead-exposure assistance unit, which has since been reinstated. In Michigan, officials said they relied on specialists from the C.D.C. to inspect a renovated public health lab so that it could restart operations. It was still waiting for a response from the agency several weeks later, according to a declaration by Elizabeth Hertel, director of the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Several states said they relied on the C.D.C. to fund help lines that people could call if they wanted support for quitting smoking, but that they got notice that their funding would end in the fall. In Michigan, the grant covered 11 staff positions and their $1.3 million Quitlink program, which provides help to those seeking to stop smoking, a declaration said. State officials in New York and Virginia said they already had to lay off about a dozen tobacco control workers each and pared back services, including support on the help lines. In West Virginia, high school students bemoaned the loss of a small anti-vaping program that gave them a chance to educate lawmakers in Charleston about policies that could help their school."
mov_08C6F1EAC6AED6B5612D0D36F4069EFF,2025-07-02 08:18:26,en,WEB,"  Preserving Our Heritage Archives & Museum has recently come into the stewardship of a vast collection of original Chambersburg area newspapers and we took some time this past winter to process through these and bring some of those materials back to life for all to enjoy. Educational leadership: New Waynesboro assistant superintendent committed to First Choice Each month we will present some of this material here in its originally published form. Today we stop by a Guilford farm, known as the Hassler homestead. Enjoy: One of the leading and successful farmers of Franklin County who has turned the half-century mark, is David Alexander Hassler, of Grindstone Hill. He was born on the Hassler homestead October 30, 1840, was the youngest son of Mr. and Mrs. John Hassler, of Guilford Township. His father was a son of Abram Hassler, one of the first settlers of the township, having removed here from Lancaster County. Many years ago Abram Hassler purchased what was then known as 'the tract of the Lost Spring,' from one of the Chambers family. 'The tract of the Lost Spring, or Dry Spring,' was named by the Indians. The tradition is that there had been a spring on the tract near where the original house was located, but the spring had disappeared before the purchase by Mr. Hassler. It is said that the Indians came there for water, this being the only spring in that locality. It is probable that this is true as the grant of land was referred to as 'The Tract of the Lost Spring' in a deed given in 1764. The tract contained about 400 acres. All of the original buildings have disappeared except that of a stone house which is very well preserved and is still in use as a storage house by the present owner. The dwelling house is built of sandstone and contains two rooms on the second floor and one on the first. It was built by Abram Hassler, the early settler. David Hassler tells a story of his grand-father bearing on the purchase of the tract, which is very amusing. After the land was purchased his grandfather was compelled to make three trips from Lancaster County before he was able to get possession. He made the trips on horse back, carrying the money in a three bushel bag. The first time he came, Mr. Chambers would not take the money and he was forced to return. The second time Mr. Chambers was still unwilling to close the contract. This time he left the money with a neighbor, Michael Helman. The third time he got permission from Mr. Chambers to sow clover seed on the farm. This Mr. Chambers was very willing for him to do and in this way gave Mr. Hassler possession without knowing it. Old newspapers now in the stewardship of Preserving Our Heritage Archives & Museum in South Mountain contain vast amounts of information about Franklin County area people and places, including Hassler homestead in Guilford Township. David A. Hassler was educated in the public schools of his native township and assisted his father on the Hassler homestead until 1865, when he married Charlotte Snyder (a daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Snyder) and began farming on his own account. He has been successful for over fifty years, all of the time (except three years, when he worked the Speilman farm in Antrim Township), he tilled the soil where he now lives. His farm is located about a half-mile south-west of the Grindstone Hill Church, on the Shady Grove road. The land is well improved and very productive. The buildings are modern and attractive. Mr. Hassler gives his entire time and attention to his apple orchard and the raising of poultry and hogs. He keeps three cows, a large flock of chickens and has sixteen hogs. His chickens are of the Plymouth Rock and Rhode Island red varieties. The orchard contains six acres. The principal varieties are York Imperial and Grimes Golden. These apples Mr. Hassler handles for market. He has a number of other varieties that he raises for his own use. He claims that the York Imperial and Grimes Golden are good bearers, excellent keepers and first class market apples. The farm land he leases to his neighbors by the year. More Once Upon Our Times: New Waynesboro Firemen's Hall cost $8,500 in 1900 In politics Mr. Hassler is a Democrat and has always been an active party worker, although he never aspired to public office. For many years he has been a member of the Grindstone Hill Reformed Church and has served as Deacon and in other church offices. He is a man of sound judgment and has firmly established himself in the confidence of his neighbors and the community. “Once Upon Our Times” is written by the Rev. Lee E.

mov_5C371725F21FCAABA1D3BE51F57CFE7D,2025-07-02 10:25:41,en,WEB,"  It's been 26 years since Julia Roberts supercharged the body positivity discussion by rocking up at the Notting Hill premiere with hairy armpits. It was a pivotal moment: one that inspired us to burn our razors (as it were) and embark on a proud new era for body hair. It wasn't quite body positivity, but it was certainly something: the inspiration for a whole generation of celebs (Drew Barrymore, Lady Gaga) to follow suit and attempt to make armpit hair a thing. Roberts' move could easily have been the starting point for a revolution: a great reclaiming of female bodies, in all their hairy glory. But was it? was supposed to be the last great taboo, smashed by , just like we smashed the glass ceiling. And yet… it feels like progress has come to a halt. Worse, it feels like it's going back entirely. Yes, body hair has never been so normalised. But it also feels like it's never been so controversial. I'm a young woman living in London, and yet I don't feel especially liberated when it comes to showing off my own. When summer comes along, the razor comes out, and any glimpse of stubble is reason enough to swap skirts for jeans that day. The same goes for most of my friends. These days, women are more relaxed about body hair than they used to be – but many of them still shave. “I shave my pits every now and then when it bothers me,” Jasmine, 30, tells me. “I used to not shave them for a while and never felt ashamed but definitely noticed people staring more and my family made comments. “I'm all for women not shaving but I feel like it does take a certain amount of bravery to show body hair. It still takes guts to do it and not feel judged.” It's not just body hair. If the late 2010s were characterised by body positivity, then the 2020s seem to be marking a turning point. In 2018, a study showed that one in four women under the age of 25 had stopped shaving their armpits. Nike's 2019 ad campaign showed Nigerian American model Annahstasia Enuke standing with her arm over her head, proudly showing off her armpit hair. Billie, a body-care brand, made waves in 2018 with a razor ad that actually showed body hair; American hair care brand Fur launched in 2017 with a range of products specifically designed to care for body hair, including pubic hair. And yet. Lizzo, once feted for her curves, is now on Ozempic, the catwalks have regressed too, with plus size models basically disappearing entirely. like Adele and Emma Corrin, who have previously talked about not shaving, don't seem to have impacted the fact that Hollywood is still predominantly white, skinny and hairless. I've not seen an advert displaying women's body hair for years. It's official: the body positivity movement has made a screeching U-turn and is heading back the way we came. “I would almost posit that it's returning a little bit more to a hairless norm now than it was maybe five years ago,” Fur's co-founder Lillian Tung says. “And that's okay. 99 per cent of people remove pubic hair and body hair at some point in their lives for a variety of reasons. There always has been and always will be an incredible amount of variety.” Lately, though, people do seem to be edging back towards the razor. Maybe it's due to the rise in 'clean girl beauty'. Think Hailey Bieber (whose business Rhode peddles in much of the same), the Hadids, Kendall Jenner, sporting slicked-back buns, immaculate manicures and white t-shirts. This trend first appeared at the start of the 2020s and while it's always been popular, it's certainly never been as popular as it is right now: there are more than 500k 'cleangirlaesthetic' posts on TikTok, and almost one million 'cleangirl' ones. Ripped tops, unbrushed hair and hairy legs: well, they're still there. But they're not leading the conversation right now. Instead, TikTok is awash with women going to Pilates classes, sipping matcha lattes and reading about tradwives. Plus OnlyFans, and its porn-esque aesthetic, is introducing a new generation to hairless bodies. With Trump holding court in Washington, it's not surprising that more traditional gender norms are reasserting themselves: the image the Republicans (and right wing governments more generally) tend to celebrate is that of the woman keeping house and getting dressed for her husband. That involves going hairless. After all, you can't be a clean girl with body hair. “Stuff like clean girl beauty or cottage core or luxury in the fashion space... I feel like a lot of these things seem very simple or innocent but in a way actually speak to the rise of conservatism and fascism that we're seeing, not just in the US but globally,” says Dominic Cadogan, the beauty editor at Glamour UK. “We've got Pete Davidson removing his tattoos, for example. I feel like all of these things exist under this umbrella of trends, that maybe speak to Gen Z's interest in conservatism, whether they know or not.” The right-wing takeover of the online space is ongoing. TikTokers like Estee Williams boast hundreds of thousands of followers and advocate for 'traditional' female values; the 'clean girl' trend is remarkable in its lack of diversity, spotlighting predominantly white, thin women doing their beauty routines. For most people (including myself), hair-free is still king. “To my mind, there's something about a woman being soft and smooth that's appealing,” says Madeleine, 40...."

Caliva and Ziya's romantic affairs captured people's interest after it abruptly ended. Online users picked sides between the boyfriend Caliva and ex-girlfriend Ziya. The details of how their breakup came about made many people rally behind Caliva. A TikTok post by @updates_house showed Caliva and Ziya's conversation that lead to a breakup. The boyfriend Caliva started the conversation expressing concern that she has become nonchalant in a paragraph. Instead of responding Ziya focused on his grammar and puncuation, insisting that she was not able to read it. She also complained that her phone was not working well and they could not talk. Between her complaints she asked what he was busy with for the day and if he was applying for jobs but he responded saying no which she did not like. In one of the exchanges, she told him she was working and he responded with a picture of himself lying in bed. Girlfriend explains break-up In a follow-up video, the Ziya explained that she wanted to help him build his career. Caliva currently volunteers at Rhode Music Radio station. She complained that his CV wasn't up to par when she looked at it and she was only trying to get him to hustle. Ziya said she also felt like he was insecure because other men who wanted her had money and she wnted to help him get to the same level. SA backs young man Tiktok users who caught wind of the story quickly chose who they supported and many were with Caliva. People encouraged him to follow his passion for radio. Many felt like Ziya's criticism of her ex-boyfriend's English was uncalled for because she makes mistakes in English too. Many speculated that Ziya wanted a provider man as she is also a mother of one.

mov_7301F4A6DF35CD7B25BAB569F092B5C4,2025-07-02 13:12:01,en,WEB,"  During the Gilded Age, wealthy families built extravagant mansions in New York City. Fifth Avenue was known as ""Millionaires' Row"" with homes belonging to the Astors and Vanderbilts. Most Gilded Age mansions in New York City were torn down to make way for new developments. Business tycoons in the Gilded Age lived in style, but it came at a cost. New York City's Fifth Avenue was once home to ""Millionaires' Row,"" where the wealthiest magnates of the Gilded Age built palatial homes as symbols of their success. At the same time, the Gilded Age was a period marked by staggering income inequality. A 2021 article in The Journal of Economic Inequality found that in 1913, the richest 0.01% of Americans held 9% of the country's wealth. The article also estimated that the modern imbalance is even higher than the Gilded Age, with 10% of US wealth controlled by the top 0.01%. As the lopsided extravagance of the Gilded Age began to give way to the social and political reforms of the Progressive Era, the gargantuan mansions began to fall out of fashion. Not to mention, the cost of employing enough staff to manage them made the homes difficult to maintain. Most of the Gilded Age mansions in New York City were demolished to make way for commercial or apartment buildings, but many still stand in Newport, Rhode Island, where families like the Vanderbilts and the Astors spent their summers in similar luxury. Take a look at just some of the houses that once lined ""Millionaires' Row."" William H. Vanderbilt was heir to Cornelius Vanderbilt's railroad and steamship fortune as his oldest son. Built in 1882, the Triple Palace housed the Vanderbilts and two of their daughters in separate but connected sections. Designed by architects John B. Snook and Charles B. Atwood, the Triple Palace featured stained-glass windows, a shared courtyard, and an art gallery spanning three stories with 207 paintings sourced from Europe, Untapped New York reported. William K. Vanderbilt and his wife, Alva Vanderbilt, enlisted architect Richard Morris Hunt to build them a French chateau-inspired home out of white limestone in order to cement their place in high society. They spent $3 million to construct the mansion in 1882, which would cost around $98 million today, Vogue reported. Since the Vanderbilts' fortune consisted of ""new money,"" their ""Petit Chateau"" was considered tasteless by elite ""old money"" families like the Astors. While 660 Fifth Avenue is no more, Marble House, the Vanderbilts' summer home in Newport, Rhode Island, still remains standing. Located on Fifth Avenue between 57th and 58th Streets, architect George B. Post designed the original mansion in 1883, and Richard Morris Hunt designed an expansion in 1893. At the time, it was thought to be the largest single-family home in New York City, Untapped New York reported. Braisted Realty Corporation purchased the Vanderbilt home in 1926, and it was demolished soon after. Bergdorf-Goodman's flagship store, which is still open today, was erected on the site in 1928. The mansion's gilded Louis XVI-style parlor didn't last, but other parts of the Vanderbilts' mansion remain in New York City. Its grand wrought-iron gates were installed outside Central Park's Conservatory Garden. Sculptural reliefs from its covered entrance now decorate the lobby of the Sherry-Netherland Hotel. The marble and mosaic mantlepiece from the entrance hall is on display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The mansion took 14 years to build and included four art galleries, a swimming pool, and its own private rail line to transport the coal needed to heat the enormous home, according to the Museum of the City of New York. It cost around $6 million to build when it was finished in 1911, or around $203 million today. It was demolished in 1927 and replaced by a luxury co-op building. After her husband, William B. Astor, died, Caroline Schermerhorn Astor lived in one section of the mansion, and her son, John Jacob Astor IV, lived in the other. Caroline Schermerhorn Astor was known for curating ""the Four Hundred,"" a list of high-society families who came from ""old money"" and shunned those with newer fortunes. She hosted many high-profile events in her Fifth Avenue mansion, where the ballroom could hold 1,200 people, DuJour reported. John Jacob Astor IV, who was one of the world's richest men, died in the sinking of the Titanic in 1912. In 1926, the American Art Association auctioned off the contents of the Astor mansion before its demolition, including its paintings, furniture, and architectural elements like decorative ceilings. The Temple Emanu-El synagogue now stands in its place on Fifth Avenue. It took three years to build Brokaw House, which was completed in 1890 by the architectural firm Rose and Stone, according to the New York Preservation Archive Project. Modeled after a French chateau, the four-story mansion featured an Italian marble entrance hall, stained-glass windows, ornate wood carvings, and a full staff. After Brokaw's death, the mansion was used as office space before it was torn down in 1965. Schwab opted to build his mansion further west, on Riverside Drive, where it covered an entire city block between 73rd and 74th Streets. The mansion included a pool and bowling alley, The New York Times reported. In 1936, Schwab offered to sell the home to the city of New York to serve as its mayoral residence, but the city declined. It was torn down in 1948 and replaced with an apartment complex.

mov_97BB10EBE93AB43A852623757EF4199C,2025-07-02 13:17:42,en,WEB,"  Scarlett Biancuzzo might be Rhode Island's next great journalist, but first, she's taking her talents to the University of Missouri. The Bristol native and Barrington High School graduate just won a $60,000 journalism scholarship from Rhode Island PBS and The Public's Radio – now known as Ocean State Media – and she's heading to one of the most prestigious journalism schools in the country. Biancuzzo was chosen from 38 applicants for the scholarship, which is now in its eighth year (the scholarship is part of a $1 million fund created at the Rhode Island Foundation). I asked Biancuzzo to tell us more about her passion for journalism and her goals. Q: When did you decide that you wanted to pursue journalism as a career? Biancuzzo: I decided to pursue a career in journalism after enrolling in Barrington High School's television production, CTE pathway program. I enrolled in this program in order to have the opportunity to attend Barrington High School rather than my assigned district school. After immersing myself in the CTE pathway, I met my adviser, John West, who pushed me to join our school's broadcasting program, ENN. I quickly found myself jumping at the opportunities to help others tell their stories. This exploration into journalism, sitting down with someone who hasn't had the pathway to tell their story, amplified my deep interest in this career. Ultimately, the opportunity to learn about and listen to others and share that with an audience, is what made me want to pursue a career in journalism. You're off to the University of Missouri, which has one of the most prestigious journalism programs in the country. What made you choose to become a Tiger? A multitude of reasons. After applying to 12 different universities and having many opportunities at hand, I was at a crossroads of not knowing which college to enroll in. I explored each university while in search of what made their journalism program unique, and when researching and touring Mizzou, I fell in love with their“Missouri Method.” This method includes a hands-on approach from one's first day of classes – an opportunity to learn by doing. In addition to this method, I also was drawn to the community at Mizzou as it is a big school with a tight community feel. If you could cover any story in the world right now, what would it be? The Russia-Ukraine War. We are indirectly involved with several wars worldwide. My empathy and focus at this time of my life is drawn toward the many experiences on the ground of all sides, rather than the politicians and the military. With this opportunity I would fly to the Ukraine and talk to the civilians there who are affected by it on a daily basis. I would want to sit down with them and ask how this war changed their lives, specifically people within my age range. While I am afforded the opportunity to receive a higher education, I would like to know how young people in war-torn countries are handling the realities of war. Are they able to receive higher education? Are they even able to finish school? This chance would mean learning more, not just for my own curiosity, but for the world to know the hardships they are enduring. What's the No. 1 thing journalists (and readers) should know about your generation? Gen Z is a generation filled with passion and curiosity. I may not be able to speak for my entire generation, but I can speak for both myself and those closest to me, that our generation is a strong one, often equipped with grit to face challenges. We have faced many hardships already with not only coming of age during the time of COVID-19, but also maturing during a time of various wars taking place overseas and experiencing political unrest in our own divided country. We have seen fundamental rights taken away, and, with that, we have risen to the occasion. I want readers and other journalists to look at my generation and know that we are strong and not afraid to have our voices heard. Let's flash forward 10 years. Where will we find Scarlett Biancuzzo? In 10 years, I'll be pursuing a successful career in journalism. It is my goal to have a career by this time, working for a large news network as a broadcast journalist. Broadcast journalism is truly an open-ended career with countless opportunities that I plan to take, head-on.

California is leading a coalition with 19 other states in a lawsuit against the Trump administration for transferring Medicaid data to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which houses U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Democrat Attorney General Rob Bonta said the federal lawsuit filed Tuesday in the Northern District of California represents the 28th time in 23 weeks – or more than once a week – that California is challenging the president in court. “Upon information and belief, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)'s Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) handed over a trove of individuals' protected health data obtained from States, including California, Illinois, and Washington, to other federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security (DHS),” the complaint says. “Millions of individuals' health information was transferred without their consent, and in violation of federal law.” Those states allow non-U.S. citizens to enroll in Medicaid programs that they say pay for their expenses using only state taxpayer dollars. The Associated Press first reported last month that the sharing of data by HHS to DHS included addresses, names, social security numbers, immigration status and claims data for enrollees in those states. DHS: ASSAULTS ON ICE NOW UP NEARLY 700% OVER SAME TIME LAST YEAR California Attorney General Rob Bonta is leading a coalition of 20 state attorneys general in a new lawsuit against the Trump administration filed Tuesday. (Justin Sullivan/) “In doing so, the Trump administration silently destroyed longstanding guardrails that protected the public's sensitive health data and restricted its use only for purposes that Congress has authorized, violating federal laws including the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA),” the lawsuit says. The complaint alleges violations of several other federal privacy laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, known as HIPPA. HHS has claimed that the transfer of data to DHS is meant “to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them.” “But Congress itself extended coverage and federal funds for emergency Medicaid to all individuals residing in the United States, even those who lack satisfactory immigration status,” the complaint says. “The States have and will continue to verify individuals' eligibility for federally funded Medicaid services using established federal systems and cooperate with federal oversight activities to ensure that the federal government pays only for those Medicaid services that are legally authorized.” Attorneys general from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington joined the suit. “President Trump, Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are weaponizing Medicaid to fuel their anti-immigration campaign,” Bonta said at a virtual press conference. “They're threatening the personal health data of 78.4 million individuals who are enrolled in Medicaid and the children's health insurance program, CHIP, for their mass surveillance and federal immigration enforcement plans.” DHS Secretary Kristi Noem attends a roundtable discussion after touring a migrant detention center, dubbed “Alligator Alcatraz,” located at the site of the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Ochopee, Florida, on July 1, 2025. (ANDREW CABALLERO-REYNOLDS/AFP via ) “This isn't about cutting waste or going after fraud,” Bonta said. “This is about going after vulnerable people who entrusted the state and the federal government to help them access health care, a basic human right.” The complaint says they intend to “protect their State Medicaid programs, and to prevent them from being used in service of an anti-immigrant crusade, or other purposes unrelated to administration of those programs.” Under Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz's leadership, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) “is aggressively cracking down on states that may be misusing federal Medicaid funds to subsidize care for illegal immigrants – that includes California,” HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon said in a statement to Fox News Digital. “This oversight effort – supported by lawful interagency data sharing with DHS – is focused on identifying waste, fraud, and systemic abuse.” “HHS acted entirely within its legal authority – and in full compliance with all applicable laws – to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them,” Nixon added. “We are not only protecting taxpayer dollars – we are restoring credibility to one of America's most vital programs. The American people deserve accountability. HHS is delivering it.” FEDERAL JUDGE REFUSES TO BLOCK TRUMP'S LA NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYMENT ON NEWSOM'S TIMEFRAME The plaintiffs claim their states “will lose federal funds as fear and confusion stemming from the disclosures cause noncitizens and their family members to disenroll, or refuse to enroll, in emergency Medicaid for which they are otherwise eligible, leaving States and their safety net hospitals to foot the bill for federally mandated emergency healthcare services.” HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. testifies before the House Energy and Commerce Committee Health Subcommittee on June 24, 2025. (Kayla Bartkowski/) “States will also ultimately bear the negative public health costs associated with reduced utilization of healthcare for childbirth and other emergency conditions,” the complaint says. “Meanwhile, the public will suffer irreparable damage due to increased morbidity and mortality.” Bonta noted California's Medi-Cal program provides public healthcare coverage for one out of every three Californians, including more than two million noncitizens. Because not all noncitizens are eligible for federally funded Medi-Cal services, California uses state-only funds to provide a version of the Medi-Cal program to all eligible state residents, “regardless of their immigration status,” he said. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “The Trump Administration has upended longstanding privacy protections with its decision to illegally share sensitive, personal health data with ICE. In doing so, it has created a culture of fear that will lead to fewer people seeking vital emergency medical care,” Bonta added in a statement. “I'm sickened by this latest salvo in the President's anti-immigrant campaign. We're headed to court to prevent any further sharing of Medicaid data — and to ensure any of the data that's already been shared is not used for immigration enforcement purposes.” The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Key Highlights AI technologies are rapidly realizing science fiction visions *The Diamond Age* predicted a personalized AI tutor decades ago Wearable AI raises privacy and behavioral concerns AI in education could revolutionize learning and social norms (THE CONVERSATION) Every time I read about another advance in AI technology, I feel like another figment of science fiction moves closer to reality. Lately, I've been noticing eerie parallels to Neal Stephenson's 1995 novel “The Diamond Age: Or, A Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.” “The Diamond Age” depicted a post-cyberpunk sectarian future, in which society is fragmented into tribes, called phyles. In this future world, sophisticated nanotechnology is ubiquitous, and a new type of AI is introduced. Though inspired by MIT nanotech pioneer Eric Drexler and Nobel Prize winner Richard Feynman, the advanced nanotechnology depicted in the novel still remains out of reach. However, the AI that's portrayed, particularly a teaching device called the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer, isn't only right in front of us; it also raises serious issues about the role of AI in labor, learning and human behavior. In Stephenson's novel, the Primer looks like a hardcover book, but each of its “pages” is really a screen display that can show animations and text, and it responds to its user in real time via AI. The book also has an audio component, which voices the characters and narrates stories being told by the device. It was originally created for the young daughter of an aristocrat, but it accidentally falls into the hands of a girl named Nell who's living on the streets of a futuristic Shanghai. The Primer provides Nell personalized emotional, social and intellectual support during her journey to adulthood, serving alternatively as an AI companion, a storyteller, a teacher and a surrogate parent. The AI is able to weave fairy tales that help a younger Nell cope with past traumas, such as her abusive home and life on the streets. It educates her on everything from math to cryptography to martial arts. In a techno-futuristic homage to George Bernard Shaw's 1913 play “Pygmalion,” the Primer goes so far as to teach Nell the proper social etiquette to be able to blend into neo-Victorian society, one of the prominent tribes in Stephenson's balkanized world. No need for 'ractors' Three recent developments in AI – in video games, wearable technology and education – reveal that building something like the Primer should no longer be considered the purview of science fiction. In May 2025, the hit video game “Fortnite” introduced an AI version of Darth Vader, who speaks with the voice of the late James Earl Jones. While it was popular among fans of the game, the Screen Actors Guild lodged a labor complaint with Epic Games, the creator of “Fortnite.” Even though Epic had received permission from the late actor's estate, the Screen Actors Guild pointed out that actors could have been hired to voice the character, and the company – in refusing to alert the union and negotiate terms – violated existing labor agreements. In “The Diamond Age,” while the Primer uses AI to generate the fairy tales that train Nell, for the voices of these archetypal characters, Stephenson concocted a low-tech solution: The characters are played by a network of what he termed “ractors” – real actors working in a studio who are contracted to perform and interact in real time with users. The Darth Vader “Fortnite” character shows that a Primer built today wouldn't need to use actors at all. It could rely almost entirely on AI voice generation and have real-time conversations, showing that today's technology already exceeds Stephenson's normally far-sighted vision. Recording and guiding in real time Synthesizing James Earl Jones' voice in “Fortnite” wasn't the only recent AI development heralding the arrival of Primer-like technology. I recently witnessed a demonstration of wearable AI that records all of the wearer's conversations. Their words are then sent to a server so they can be analyzed by AI, providing both summaries and suggestions to the user about future behavior. Several startups are making these “always on” AI wearables. In an April 29, 2025, essay titled “I Recorded Everything I Said for Three Months. AI Has Replaced My Memory,” Wall Street Journal technology columnist Joanna Stern describes the experience of using this technology. She concedes that the assistants created useful summaries of her conversations and meetings, along with helpful to-do lists. However, they also recalled “every dumb, private and cringeworthy thing that came out of my mouth.” These devices also create privacy issues. The people whom the user interacts with don't always know they are being recorded, even as their words are also sent to a server for the AI to process them. To Stern, the technology's potential for mass surveillance becomes readily appar..."

The number of residents age 65 years and older in the Myrtle Beach metropolitan area grew by 6.3% last year, making it the fastest-growing metro area for senior citizens in the U.S., according to population estimates the U.S. Census Bureau released last week. During the 2020s, Myrtle Beach's senior population has grown by more than 22%, also the fastest rate in the United States this decade. Senior citizens now make up more than a quarter of the around 413,000 residents in metro Myrtle Beach, which once was known for being a budget beach destination. The community with a mile-long boardwalk and 200-foot Ferris wheel used to attract biker rallies which the city tried to end in the late 2000s because of the noise, traffic and rowdiness. But now the noisy streets have had to make room for quiet diners and pickleball courts. The COVID-19 pandemic played a role in the area's senior boom as people in such places as Ohio and New York who had been vacationing for years in Myrtle Beach realized they could retire early or work from home anywhere, said Mark Kruea, a longtime public information officer for Myrtle Beach who is now running to be mayor. “Many people converted that thought into action,” Kruea said. “The climate's great, taxes are low, there's a wealth of opportunities for recreation, dining and shopping.” A graying United States The U.S. population age 65 and older rose by 3.1% last year, while the population under age 18 decreased by 0.2%. In the past two decades, seniors have increased from 12.4% to 18% of the U.S. population, while the share of children has dropped from 25% to 21.5%, according to the population estimates. Maine, Vermont, and Florida were the only three states where older adults outnumbered children as recently as 2020. But four years later, those states were joined by Delaware, Hawaii, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia. Maine last year had the oldest median age at 44.8, while Utah's was the youngest at 32.4. Groups that saw the most growth The share of the U.S. population that is Hispanic reached 20% last year for the first time, helped by an annual gain of 1.9 million Hispanics mostly through migration. In pure numbers, the Hispanic population grew the most last year in the New York, Houston and Miami metro areas. When it comes to growth rates, the biggest gains were in smaller metros such as Ocala, Florida; Panama City, Florida; and St. Joseph, Missouri. For Black residents whose growth last year was split between migration and natural increase, the biggest gains were in the Houston, New York and Dallas-Fort Worth metro areas in pure numbers. Bozeman, Montana, and Provo, Utah — metro areas with tiny Black populations to start with — were tops in growth rates. In pure numbers, the New York, Dallas-Fort Worth and Seattle metro areas had the biggest Asian population gains, and the growth came primarily from migration. The largest growth rates were in three metro areas with small Asian populations: Farmington, New Mexico; Bismarck, North Dakota; and Burlington, North Carolina. The non-Hispanic white population in the United States declined slightly last year, but it grew the most in the Nashville, Tennessee; New York and Charlotte, North Carolina metro areas in pure numbers. The biggest growth rates for the white population were in the Myrtle Beach; Daphne-Fairhope, Alabama; and Wilmington, North Carolina metro areas. The decline in the white population was driven by deaths outpacing births."
mov_9B481A679164FC5972B630C87373FE4F,2025-07-02 15:04:21,en,WEB,"  Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea J. Campbell has opened another front in her ongoing legal battle with the Trump administration, charging that the Republican White House exposed private health information as it prosecutes its mass deportation campaign. The lawsuit, filed by Democrat Campbell and 19 of her colleagues nationwide, in U.S. District Court in California's Northern District on Tuesday, names U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert K. Kennedy Jr. and U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem as defendants. ""Disclosing individuals' private health data for the purpose of immigration enforcement puts lives at risk. These actions are yet another example of the Administration creating unnecessary fear and confusion among our residents,” Campbell said in a statement. “Congress has made it clear that emergency Medicaid coverage extends to all individuals, regardless of immigration status. I will continue to fight against cruel and unlawful policies that harm our residents,” she said. Kennedy's advisers ordered the release of a dataset that includes the private health information of people living in California, Illinois, Washington state, and Washington, D.C., to the Department of Homeland Security, The Associated Press first reported last month. All of those states allow non-U.S. citizens to enroll in Medicaid programs that pay for their expenses using only state taxpayer dollars. The unusual data sharing of private health information, including addresses, names, social security numbers, immigration status, and claims data for enrollees in those states, was released to deportation officials as they accelerated enforcement efforts nationwide. The data could be used to help the Department of Homeland Security locate migrants in its mass deportation campaign, experts said. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who led the legal action, said the Trump administration's data release violates federal health privacy protection laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the AP reported. “This is about flouting seven decades of federal law policy and practice that have made it clear that personal healthcare data is confidential and can only be shared in certain narrow circumstances that benefit the public's health or the Medicaid program,” Bonta said during a news conference on Tuesday. The Trump administration has sought to arm deportation officials with more data on immigrants. In May, for example, a federal judge refused to block the Internal Revenue Service from sharing immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help agents locate and detain people living without legal status in the U.S. The lawsuit filed by Campbell and her colleagues asks a federal judge to block any new transfer or use of this data for immigration enforcement purposes. It argues that the administration violated a brace of federal laws, including the Administrative Procedure Act, Social Security Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Modernization Act, Privacy Act, and Spending Clause. The lawsuit also “highlights that the Trump Administration's illegal actions are creating fear and confusion that will lead noncitizens and their family members to disenroll, or refuse to enroll, in emergency Medicaid for which they are otherwise eligible, leaving states and their safety net hospitals to foot the bill for federally mandated emergency healthcare services,” Cambell's office said in its statement. Other states joining the legal action included Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

mov_543D7AF69EE9237C2F1E317B3B77265B,2025-07-02 15:15:29,en,WEB,"  Michigan's AG joins 20 states in suing Trump for sharing Medicaid data with ICE, claiming the administration is breaching privacy laws. LANSING, Michigan — Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced Wednesday she's joined a 20-state coalition filing a federal lawsuit against the Trump Administration for illegally sharing personal Medicaid health data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, challenges the Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) decision to transfer confidential healthcare records to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for immigration enforcement purposes. ""Our personal healthcare data is exactly that: personal,"" Nessel said. ""It should remain confidential and be accessible only to agencies directly involved with Medicaid. This unlawful move by the Trump Administration to grant access to unrelated entities will undoubtedly harm the health, privacy, and well-being of all Michiganders."" States learned on June 13 through news reports that HHS had transferred massive Medicaid data files containing millions of Americans' personal health records to DHS. Reports indicate the federal government plans to use this information to create a database for ""mass deportations"" and large-scale immigration enforcement. The data sharing breaks 70 years of legal precedent. Since Medicaid's creation in 1965, federal law has required that personal healthcare data remain confidential, shared only in narrow circumstances benefiting public health and program integrity. In Michigan, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) cover more than 2.6 million residents – over 25% of the state's population, including more than 1 million children. The Attorney General's office says it was not aware that Michigan residents' data has been transferred to DHS. The Trump Administration claims the data transfer ensures ""Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them."" However, Congress itself extended emergency Medicaid coverage to all U.S. residents, regardless of immigration status. The coalition argues the administration's actions will cause noncitizens and their families to avoid emergency medical care they're legally entitled to receive, forcing states and hospitals to cover federally mandated services while potentially causing preventable deaths. The lawsuit alleges violations of the Administrative Procedure Act, Social Security Act, HIPAA, Privacy Act and other federal laws. The states seek to block future data transfers and prevent DHS from using existing data for immigration enforcement. Joining Michigan in the lawsuit are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. With 78.4 million Americans enrolled in Medicaid and CHIP nationwide, the data transfer could represent one of the largest healthcare privacy breaches in U.S. history."

He died at the airport in November 2022. Life's a beach In Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, the rents are just as sky-high as in any major city. So Marcio Mizael Matolias came up with a unique solution. Known by locals as the 'Sand King', he spent decades living on Barra da Tijuca beach in a sandcastle of his own design. The structure is built around a wooden frame and redecorated daily with his incredible sand sculptures. At a snail's pace Known in China as the Great Snail Man, Liu Lingchao was famous for carrying his house around on his back. The wannabe invertebrate made the 60kg hut out of bamboo and plastic sheets, after losing his job in 2008, and started lugging it around while he collected rubbish. He regularly hauled it from his rural village to the city of Liuzhou, where he sold empty plastic bottles for recycling. Closet case A homeless woman in Kasuya, western Japan, spent more than a year living on the top shelf of a stranger's closet. She was arrested in May 2008 after being spotted on the homeowner's security footage, moving around his property and nicking food from his fridge. The unidentified 57-year-old told police he had become suspicious after noticing food going missing. Mall's well that ends well Artist Michael Townsend spend four years living in a shopping centre in Rhode Island, US, after building himself a secret room. And he didn't just move in alone – he brought his wife and several friends, who spent their time in the Providence Place Mall relaxing on the sofa and playing video games. He was finally caught in 2007 after hosting a party for a visiting Chinese artist. Tree's company An Indian man, named only as Sanjay, spent nine months living in a guava tree after falling out with his wife. The 25-year-old, from Mumbai, had the mother of all strops after catching her cheating with a neighbour in 2012, pals said. He apparently refused to come down until she apologised – so she moved in with her parents. Fire underground The town of Centralia, Pennsylvania, must have been very special at some point. It was once a thriving mining town – until a devastating blaze in 1962 caused flames to spread through an underground network of coal tunnels. It has apparently been on fire ever since. Most of the residents moved out, but incredibly, a handful are still living there.

I sat down with the team recently to talk about what's been happening at the General Assembly, including the budget. One of our key budget initiatives was including more funding to raise Medicaid reimbursement rates for primary care physicians. Rhode Island has lagged other states in what it allows for reimbursement rates for Medicaid patients, and as a result, many doctors have chosen to practice elsewhere. I've heard from many people struggling to find doctors and health care in Rhode Island. I completely empathize - I don't have a primary care doctor myself right now. My PCP opted to leave the medical field early due to burnout. This was a very challenging fiscal year, but the budget crafted by the General Assembly met the critical needs of our state. We also did a lot of really good things for our communities. Read the full story:"

mov_7AEEB7A50FB07F4342D5F3533D91E955,2025-07-02 15:58:07,en,WEB,"  (written by Islander) Nearly a decade after their inception, the Rhode Island based black metal band Ancient Torment will at last release their debut album after a handful of shorter records that have emerged beginning in 2019. Entitled Follow the Echo of Curses, it will be discharged by the Eternal Death label on August 1st. Although this is a first album, it's not the work of novices: The band's lineup includes members of such bands as Witch King, I, Destroyer, and Cruciamentum, and former members of Black Sorcery (among other bands). And it doesn't sound like a novice work either. The music is often vast and emotionally devastating in its dynamic renditions of fury, torment, and desolation, the kind of experiences that swallow up listeners and hold them captive to the band's intentions. Not for naught does Eternal Death describe the album as “an immersive, introspective journey through the shadows of abysmal suffering and mysteries of death's embrace.” To help blaze the path toward the record's release, today we're premiering one of its six expansive songs, “Under the Guise of Virtue“. In this song Ancient Torment attack without prelude, discharging a dense and malicious anti-harmony of viciously roiling riffage and hammering beats, a layered swarm of abrasion and tire-iron blows augmented by blistering screams behind the mic. As the song continues surging forward the drum rhythms change to punk beats and the emotional quality of those amply layered guitars (both caustic and fire-bright) changes too: Still frantic, they elevate and broaden the expanse of the music to near-symphonic scale, but the melody becomes intensely bereft, a storm of suffering and desperation. The music begins to sound like a conflict among warring forces. One side cruelly attacks with blast-beats and unhinged fretwork blizzards; another creates glorious, swirling exhortations and summons feral energies; and still, while the music blazes and wildly pulsates, a lead guitar pierces through the maelstrom and seems to wretchedly wail, manifesting the pain. The song's darker and more devastating moods eventually become even more shadow-cast as the tempo slows. In the low end the music seems to stagger and heave, and the vocals transition from scorching derangement to gloomy tones, half-spoken and half-sung. But the spectacular storms spin up again, reprising the ravishing motifs that so extravagantly marked the song's opening phases. “Under the Guise of Virtue” is an incredibly intense, incredibly engulfing, incredibly adrenaline-triggering experience, and melodically very memorable as well. The album was recorded at Distorted Forest Studio, described as “a space of reclusive solitude in the woods of northern Rhode Island”, over the early months of 2024. It was mixed by Josh Welshman (Flux Studios NYC), mastered by Dan Lowndes (Resonance Sound Studio), and features cover art by David Thiérrée. Find pre-order and further info about the album and the band below. We've also included a stream of the first advance track from the album, “Sorrow Verses“, which is every bit as ravaging, as dynamic, and as wholly immersive as the song we've just premiered, and maybe even more emotionally shattering, nearly overpowering in its rendering of torment and loss.

tw_sl_576f29211a51eca451c4960f054f4407,2025-07-02 16:49:36,en,WEB,"  PAWTUCKET, R.I. — Within seven seconds of throwing open his cruiser door, Pawtucket Police Officer Thomas Letourneau shot across a wide intersection where vehicles waited at a traffic light, wounding a mentally disabled man holding a toy gun about 150 feet away. The scene captured by surveillance video from a local restaurant was among 16 videos that the city of Pawtucket released late Tuesday evening in response to numerous public-records requests regarding the June 8 shooting of 28-year-old Sebastian Yidana. Surveillance video from Mangos Restaurant at 15 Exchange St., Pawtucket, R.I., shows Officer Thomas Letourneau arriving and shooting at Sebastian Yidana. It's also the only video the city released that shows the shooting. The footage from Letourneau's body-worn camera was edited to show only 4 minutes and 2 seconds after the shooting occurred. That clip begins with Letourneau handcuffing James Dean, a resident who was tackled by police as he yelled at officers not to shoot Yidana. It is labeled “redacted” and does not show the shooting itself. Footage from the body-worn camera of Pawtucket Police Officer Thomas Letourneau on June 8, 2025, shows his actions after he shot Sebastian Yidana. Letourneau can be heard trying to catch his breath and cursing. Another officer walks him to a cruiser and tells him to take a seat inside. “F--k. My body camera's on, f--k,” Letourneau says and throws his sunglasses on the dashboard. “Don't talk to anybody, all right?” a third officer tells him soon after. “Take a breath.” The other videos captured the chaotic aftermath, as swarms of officers responded in seconds to Letourneau's call about “shots fired.” Officer Matthew Levasseur jumped out of his cruiser with his gun drawn, shouting at Dean, a resident who was shouting at police as he stood with Yidana. “Get out of the way so we can help him!” Levasseur shouted. Levasseur was the first officer to reach Yidana. He called for a rescue and yelled for gloves, and asked the fallen man's name. “I might die,” Yidana answered softly, barely audible under James' screams. “I hope I die.” Video from the body camera worn by Pawtucket Officer Matthew Levasseur on June 8, 2025, shows the aftermath of the shooting of Sebastian Yidana. “You're not gonna die, buddy,” Levasseur responded. He pulled on gloves and put pressure on Yidana's bleeding wound. “Was it an officer who did this?” Levasseur asked, several times. “Yes,” Yidana said. Dean had his hands in the air, screaming, “Toy gun!” as Officer Andrew Dutra drew his gun and shouted for him to get on the ground. Letourneau tackled Dean to the pavement, and as the officers handcuffed him, Dean kept asking, “Why am I getting arrested?” One officer picked up the camouflage-colored, orange-tipped, plastic toy gun that Yidana dropped when he was shot. When Officer Nicholas Dadona saw it, he sounded confused. “That's not the gun,” Dadona can be heard saying on the video from his body-worn camera. “Where's the real gun?” Pawtucket Police Department Yidana had been playing with the toy gun as he stood at the corner of Goff Avenue and Broad Street, outside his apartment building at 10 Goff Ave. “He's been doing that with the gun the last couple of days, out here, going up to people's cars,” a woman was overheard telling another officer on one of the videos released by the police department. Scott Fontes, another resident who was taken into custody, is heard on video telling Dudona that Yidana had been outside with the toy gun when he heard sudden pops of gunfire. “I hope that kid don't die,” Fontes said. “Who the f--k shot him?” The bullets also struck a parked vehicle and the front of the Blackstone Valley Community Action Program building on Goff Avenue. Amanda Milkovits/Globe Staff Yidana's family said the videos do not explain why he was shot. “Please, please release all of the videos right now,” implored Yidana's mother, Regina Socree. “I don't understand why they are playing this game. Release them so we can see what actually happened. This is a human being we are talking about.” Yidana was diagnosed with bipolar disorder and schizophrenia when he was in his late teens; his mother said the police are aware of his mental illness. From his bed at Rhode Island Hospital, Yidana told the Globe recently that he bore no ill will against Letourneau...."

Is an automated line the same as fully robotic?

It's literally in the name The community bears the cost multiple times over, and receives no benefit; besides faster delivers, maybe.

Although Diana called us saying she had been backed up in traffic, she arrived on time and we were provided with an interesting presentation of her machine quilting journey. More on that later but first . . .     UFOs (Unfinished Objects)     We had to minimized some of the routine presentations due to our meeting being relocated to the Iris Hotel in Falmouth (story for another day) and only had a couple of hours for Diana's trunk show. Reveals such as Show & Tell, Block of the Month, and Comfort Quilts were delayed until our July meeting. Our UFO coordinator, Susan N-C, wasn't able to attend the meeting this month but a few members who weren't going to be available to attend next month's meeting brought in their projects to prove they had done their due diligence. I apologize for not getting clear photos but our space was a bit tight this month. CLICK ON PHOTO TO ENLARGE                               Janet S. brought in her memorable ""Lighthouses of Cape Cod"" quilt and spring-colored churn dash. Charlotte Toia showed off this amazing quilt titled ""Zoo Portrait"". The pattern designer is Cassandra Ireland Beaver. Pauli P. is still recovering from her surgery but glad to see she was back at her sewing machine. She completed the dreamy mermaid quilt but check out the background! Lastly, Sharon P. finished this peaceful pastel star quilt. Thanks for the eye candy ladies!! Diana Annis was our featured presenter in June. Diana is a machine quilter on both domestic and longarm machines. She is also an AQS Certified Appraiser of Quilts and Quilted Textiles. Diana describes herself as follows:      I have stitched in one way or another all my life. The quilting bug hit in 1976 during the rebirth of the quilting movement. But in the 80's a family ensued and making clothes and gifts for my family were a priority. During this time I took the opportunity to study advertising design at the Rhode Island School Of Design. I still go back and once in a classroom - I'm home. In 2002 I found myself between jobs and needing to make a change. I jumped in with both feet and bought a longarm quilting machine. I was one of the first machine quilters to work on Quilts of Valor. I am completely hand guided, (no computer), and my favorite is custom quilting. My own quilts have been exhibited across the country and have won numerous awards. Some works have been exhibited in several galleries, a calendar, magazines, books and online. I have recently begun to work on my own patterns and to pattern some of my antique quilts. Antiques and American history are a big interest for me and feed my love of quilt history. It was clear to see that Diana puts as much consideration into how her quilting will enhance her quilt top as well as how it can bring meaning to the back. The example below clearly shows what a solid black backing stitched with red thread can achieve. Using a different color thread in the bobbin created this dramatic affect. The red buttons on the back were used to cover the stitching of the colored buttons on the stars on the front. CLICK PHOTOS TO ENLARGE               These quilts were some Diana created as she expanded her quilting journey. The middle quilt was part of a challenge for a group she belonged to. Each member picked a letter that spelled out a phrase (unfortunately I didn't write it down) and designed their own letter and panel. The large letter was appliqued on and the remaining sentiment was stenciled then stitched around. The sample on the right is an example of machine Trapunto. Here's one example of how to achieve this look. https://youtu.be/fDjw4Wo37ew?feature=shared CLICK PHOTOS TO ENLARGE                   Here are a few more of Diana's quilts. Diane designed the fun wallhanging on the right for a challenge and the quilt is titled ""Who Me?"" . Each owl features a different expression and all but one has the same quilted background. Can you guess who the culprit is? Such fun! CLICK PHOTOS TO ENLARGE                   This amazing quilt top was made by Diana's friend and she asked Diana to quilt it.

The number of residents age 65 years and older in the Myrtle Beach metropolitan area grew by 6.3% last year, making it the fastest-growing metro area for senior citizens in the U.S., according to population estimates the U.S. Census Bureau released last week. During the 2020s, Myrtle Beach's senior population has grown by more than 22%, also the fastest rate in the United States this decade. Senior citizens now make up more than a quarter of the around 413,000 residents in metro Myrtle Beach, which once was known for being a budget beach destination. The community with a mile-long boardwalk and 200-foot Ferris wheel used to attract biker rallies which the city tried to end in the late 2000s because of the noise, traffic and rowdiness. But now the noisy streets have had to make room for quiet diners and pickleball courts. The sun starts setting near the Springmaid Pier, Feb. 4, 2023, in Myrtle Beach, S.C. (AP Photo/Chris Seward, file) The COVID-19 pandemic played a role in the area's senior boom as people in such places as Ohio and New York who had been vacationing for years in Myrtle Beach realized they could retire early or work from home anywhere, said Mark Kruea, a longtime public information officer for Myrtle Beach who is now running to be mayor. “Many people converted that thought into action,” Kruea said. “The climate's great, taxes are low, there's a wealth of opportunities for recreation, dining and shopping.” A graying United States The U.S. population age 65 and older rose by 3.1% last year, while the population under age 18 decreased by 0.2%. In the past two decades, seniors have increased from 12.4% to 18% of the U.S. population, while the share of children has dropped from 25% to 21.5%, according to the population estimates. Maine, Vermont, and Florida were the only three states where older adults outnumbered children as recently as 2020. But four years later, those states were joined by Delaware, Hawaii, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia. Maine last year had the oldest median age at 44.8, while Utah's was the youngest at 32.4. Groups that saw the most growth The share of the U.S. population that is Hispanic reached 20% last year for the first time, helped by an annual gain of 1.9 million Hispanics mostly through migration. In pure numbers, the Hispanic population grew the most last year in the New York, Houston and Miami metro areas. When it comes to growth rates, the biggest gains were in smaller metros such as Ocala, Florida; Panama City, Florida; and St. Joseph, Missouri. For Black residents whose growth last year was split between migration and natural increase, the biggest gains were in the Houston, New York and Dallas-Fort Worth metro areas in pure numbers. Bozeman, Montana, and Provo, Utah — metro areas with tiny Black populations to start with — were tops in growth rates. In pure numbers, the New York, Dallas-Fort Worth and Seattle metro areas had the biggest Asian population gains, and the growth came primarily from migration. The largest growth rates were in three metro areas with small Asian populations: Farmington, New Mexico; Bismarck, North Dakota; and Burlington, North Carolina. The non-Hispanic white population in the United States declined slightly last year, but it grew the most in the Nashville, Tennessee; New York and Charlotte, North Carolina metro areas in pure numbers. The biggest growth rates for the white population were in the Myrtle Beach; Daphne-Fairhope, Alabama; and Wilmington, North Carolina metro areas. The decline in the white population was driven by deaths outpacing births. Originally Published: July 2, 2025 at 3:06 PM EDT"

tw_sl_2f31cc513ad1b080c9e2a3de2cb227ab,2025-07-02 19:15:07,en,WEB,"  Limited-time offers and deals on artificially scarce products are helping grocers win shoppers at brick-and-mortar locations, according to a new report from data analytics firm Placer.ai. These highly sought after product drops are resonating with shoppers at Trader Joe's and Target in particular, both of which launched special deals this spring. Trader Joe's released a limited-edition branded mini tote bag in 2024 and brought it back in April, driving up foot traffic. And Target grabbed shoppers' attention with its high-profile product drop in April from the Kate Spade Collection of apparel, shoes, accessories, and home goods. Placer.ai noted in a blog post that the Trader Joe's tote bag raised foot traffic by 21.2% on the day of the launch, making it the grocer's busiest day of 2025. “The success of the program may stem in part from Trader Joe's strong appeal to consumer segments heavily influenced by social media,” according to Placer.ai's Elizabeth Lafontaine. “In April 2025, the chain saw a higher penetration among 'Educated Urbanites' and 'Young Professionals' compared to the wider grocery industry—two groups that would be heavily clued into viral product trends.” The Kate Spade Collection drop from Target drew less foot traffic than its past limited-time product deals, possibly because of the launch on its website, Target.com. Related:Target enters summer deals season with grocery deals “In-store visitation on launch day (Saturday, April 12) was down 6.8% compared to the release day of 2024's collaboration with designer Diane Von Furstenberg and down 3.0% compared to the launch day of 2023's collaboration with Agua Bendita, Rhode, and Fe Noel,” according to the report. The report noted that “the collection also debuted on Target.com at midnight PST the same day, so in-store traffic may not reflect overall demand.” “As retailers grapple with how to provide value to consumers amidst economic uncertainty, these offerings provide a new incentive for shoppers to visit that isn't solely focused on price. Consumers may indeed perceive limited runs to be higher quality, more valuable or worth the extra investment,” the report noted. “The concept of manufactured scarcity isn't new in retail, but it continues to take on new forms as the consumer and industry evolve. We may reach a point where exclusivity and scarcity no longer move the needle for retailers, but that doesn't seem likely in 2025.” Download the Supermarket News media kit here"

Not in person, obviously. All of my actual travel revolves, happily, gratefully, around my son's lacrosse team and my daughter's college schedule. My mind, on the other hand, travels (also happily, gratefully) in books. ""The Wedding People"" by Alison Espach; ""Prep"" by Curtis Sittenfeld (an oldie I was late to); ""We All Want Impossible Things"" by Catherine Newman (one of the best books I've ever read); ""Tell Me Everything"" by Elizabeth Strout; ""Sandwich"" also by Catherine Newman; and ""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"" by Taylor Jenkins Reid, most recently. Stories are magic. They introduce me to new people and let me live in their heads and learn from their heartbreak and humor and terrible decisions and wisdom and fears and triumphs. Stories make my world bigger. They complicate easy narratives. They shrink my blind spots. They remind me to hope. ""The Sum of Us"" by Heather McGhee taught me more about the United States than a lifetime of history classes. ""Mercy Street"" by Jennifer Haigh gave me an entirely new lens through which to view reproductive rights. I think about ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" by Dave Eggers at least once a week. Books do that. Art does that. And it is, like so many things that sustain us, under attack right now. Hundreds of arts groups across the country received notice that their National Endowment for the Arts grants were being withdrawn or terminated in May, the same day President Donald Trump called for eliminating the NEA altogether, as well as the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Library and Museum Services. It would be tempting to write this off as a minor outrage in the grand scheme of outrages unfolding right now. The budget bill that, as of this writing, just passed through the U.S. Senate slashes Medicaid, Affordable Care Act and rural hospital funding, earmarks $45 billion for migrant detention facility beds, rolls back clean energy projects and adds at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Among other things. But if the first six months of this administration have taught us anything, it's that we can be appalled by more than one thing simultaneously. And a society that doesn't cultivate and support and sustain art is an appalling thought. Art matters. It connects us. It softens us. It moves us. ""Everyone - no matter their belief system or politics - deserves art,"" Anne Helen Peterson wrote in her July 2 newsletter. ""You deserve art you love and you deserve art that pisses you off and you deserve art that makes you think. ""We also deserve art,"" she continued, ""that's not subject to the whims of capitalism or individual taste; if we only fund art that's pleasing or inoffensive, we end up with a bleak art world composed of Justin Timberlake's 'Can't Stop the Feeling' from the 'Trolls' soundtrack on repeat forever."" Which would not only be deeply unpleasant, it would stunt our growth. Rebecca Makkai, author of the phenomenal, Pulitzer Prize finalist ""The Great Believers,"" wrote a stirring defense of the arts on the same day as the $40 million, taxpayer funded military parade in Washington, D.C. It was headlined, ""Your Kid's Art Class is Paying for This Parade."" ""It's not as if there's a trail of crumbs straight from the NEA cuts to this parade,"" Makkai wrote. ""But when your priority is to defund the things that give people a voice and to fund the things that scare people into silence, it's hard not to see them as two sides of one coin."" Precisely. Makkai, as it happens, is one of the authors whose name appeared on an AI-generated summer reading list published in a handful of major newspapers recently. The list, which had no byline, recommended 15 new titles, only five of which actually exist. My book- and newspaper-loving heart shattered a little bit that day. There's an awful lot working against our humanity right now. But there are so many reasons to defend it. There are so many reasons not to give in - to cruelty, to fear, to lazy thinking, to shortcuts that take us to dark places. Art narrates those reasons. Art illuminates those reasons.

Not in person, obviously. All of my actual travel revolves, happily, gratefully, around my son's lacrosse team and my daughter's college schedule. My mind, on the other hand, travels (also happily, gratefully) in books. ""The Wedding People"" by Alison Espach; ""Prep"" by Curtis Sittenfeld (an oldie I was late to); ""We All Want Impossible Things"" by Catherine Newman (one of the best books I've ever read); ""Tell Me Everything"" by Elizabeth Strout; ""Sandwich"" also by Catherine Newman; and ""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"" by Taylor Jenkins Reid, most recently. Stories are magic. They introduce me to new people and let me live in their heads and learn from their heartbreak and humor and terrible decisions and wisdom and fears and triumphs. Stories make my world bigger. They complicate easy narratives. They shrink my blind spots. They remind me to hope. ""The Sum of Us"" by Heather McGhee taught me more about the United States than a lifetime of history classes. ""Mercy Street"" by Jennifer Haigh gave me an entirely new lens through which to view reproductive rights. I think about ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" by Dave Eggers at least once a week. Books do that. Art does that. And it is, like so many things that sustain us, under attack right now. Hundreds of arts groups across the country received notice that their National Endowment for the Arts grants were being withdrawn or terminated in May, the same day President Donald Trump called for eliminating the NEA altogether, as well as the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Library and Museum Services. It would be tempting to write this off as a minor outrage in the grand scheme of outrages unfolding right now. The budget bill that, as of this writing, just passed through the U.S. Senate slashes Medicaid, Affordable Care Act and rural hospital funding, earmarks $45 billion for migrant detention facility beds, rolls back clean energy projects and adds at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Among other things. But if the first six months of this administration have taught us anything, it's that we can be appalled by more than one thing simultaneously. And a society that doesn't cultivate and support and sustain art is an appalling thought. Art matters. It connects us. It softens us. It moves us. ""Everyone - no matter their belief system or politics - deserves art,"" Anne Helen Peterson wrote in her July 2 newsletter. ""You deserve art you love and you deserve art that pisses you off and you deserve art that makes you think. ""We also deserve art,"" she continued, ""that's not subject to the whims of capitalism or individual taste; if we only fund art that's pleasing or inoffensive, we end up with a bleak art world composed of Justin Timberlake's 'Can't Stop the Feeling' from the 'Trolls' soundtrack on repeat forever."" Which would not only be deeply unpleasant, it would stunt our growth. Rebecca Makkai, author of the phenomenal, Pulitzer Prize finalist ""The Great Believers,"" wrote a stirring defense of the arts on the same day as the $40 million, taxpayer funded military parade in Washington, D.C.

mov_6022A1AF6C7A75FEFB471009F81EBF07,2025-07-02 19:35:55,en,WEB,"  In the past few months I've traveled to an extravagant, loveless wedding on the coast of Rhode Island, a midsize prep school outside Boston, a long, awful, gorgeous goodbye between two soulmates inside Graceful Shepherd Hospice, a retirement community in Maine, a beach-town rental on Cape Cod and a whole bunch of spots in Los Angeles, both gritty and glamorous. Not in person, obviously. All of my actual travel revolves, happily, gratefully, around my son's lacrosse team and my daughter's college schedule. My mind, on the other hand, travels (also happily, gratefully) in books. ""The Wedding People"" by Alison Espach; ""Prep"" by Curtis Sittenfeld (an oldie I was late to); ""We All Want Impossible Things"" by Catherine Newman (one of the best books I've ever read); ""Tell Me Everything"" by Elizabeth Strout; ""Sandwich"" also by Catherine Newman; and ""The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo"" by Taylor Jenkins Reid, most recently. Stories are magic. They introduce me to new people and let me live in their heads and learn from their heartbreak and humor and terrible decisions and wisdom and fears and triumphs. Stories make my world bigger. They complicate easy narratives. They shrink my blind spots. They remind me to hope. ""The Sum of Us"" by Heather McGhee taught me more about the United States than a lifetime of history classes. ""Mercy Street"" by Jennifer Haigh gave me an entirely new lens through which to view reproductive rights. I think about ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius"" by Dave Eggers at least once a week. Books do that. Art does that. And it is, like so many things that sustain us, under attack right now. Hundreds of arts groups across the country received notice that their National Endowment for the Arts grants were being withdrawn or terminated in May, the same day President Donald Trump called for eliminating the NEA altogether, as well as the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Institute of Library and Museum Services. It would be tempting to write this off as a minor outrage in the grand scheme of outrages unfolding right now. The budget bill that, as of this writing, just passed through the U.S. Senate slashes Medicaid, Affordable Care Act and rural hospital funding, earmarks $45 billion for migrant detention facility beds, rolls back clean energy projects and adds at least $3.3 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. Among other things. But if the first six months of this administration have taught us anything, it's that we can be appalled by more than one thing simultaneously. And a society that doesn't cultivate and support and sustain art is an appalling thought. Art matters. It connects us. It softens us. It moves us. ""Everyone - no matter their belief system or politics - deserves art,"" Anne Helen Peterson wrote in her July 2 newsletter. ""You deserve art you love and you deserve art that pisses you off and you deserve art that makes you think. ""We also deserve art,"" she continued, ""that's not subject to the whims of capitalism or individual taste; if we only fund art that's pleasing or inoffensive, we end up with a bleak art world composed of Justin Timberlake's 'Can't Stop the Feeling' from the 'Trolls' soundtrack on repeat forever."" Which would not only be deeply unpleasant, it would stunt our growth. Rebecca Makkai, author of the phenomenal, Pulitzer Prize finalist ""The Great Believers,"" wrote a stirring defense of the arts on the same day as the $40 million, taxpayer funded military parade in Washington, D.C.

Get more stories like these every day in your inbox by subscribing to The National Observer newsletter. The uncertain future of federal research grants may filter into the startup space, with tech-focused ventures finding universities less available to stand as development and funding partners, reports Mary Vanac of the Cleveland Business Journal. Universities are a ""critical part "" of the ecosystem that develops and commercializes new technologies, said Jill Enos, managing partner of TitletownTech, a Wisconsin-based venture-capital firm. That's most true in the early stages of a venture, when investments are risky and commercialization is in the distant future. ""The first thing I'll tell founders is the best thing you can do before coming to venture [capital], if you're in any kind of a new technology or science, [is] take advantage of non-dilutive funding that comes from [Small Business Innovation Research] or [National Institutes of Health] grants, "" Enos said. On average, one startup is launched in a local economy when a university secures about $1.5 million in additional federal research funding, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research report. . Through the first six months of the year, the NIH had awarded 21,218 grants totaling $11.42 billion, down from 36,028 awards totaling $18.46 billion during the same period in 2024 — or, a 38% decline in total value of grants awarded. On top of that, the NIH has either terminated or frozen funding for up to 4,473 grants this year, according to Grant Watch, — though Grant Watch notes that 892 of those grants may have been subsequently reinstated. A number of universities across the country already are and taking action as a result. Among the recent activity, Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, this week said and plans to implement operational cuts in the coming year, reports Mary Serreze of Providence Business First. FULL STORIES: Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee , reports Rich Kirchen of the Milwaukee Business Journal. Goolsbee, who headlined MBJ's Mid-Year Outlook 2025 event recently, didn't rule out a forthcoming interest rate reduction, but he did say it's too early to determine how President Donald Trump's tariff policy is impacting the American economy. If the dust settles and the tariffs haven't caused any non-transitory inflation, Goolsbee said, the Fed should proceed to reduce interest rates. For now, however, Federal Reserve officials are holding rates steady between 4.25% and 4.5%, though rate cuts could be possible in the second half of the year. Goolsbee's comments came ahead of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell this week discussing how of new tariff policy on the economy. FULL STORY: Amazon.com Inc.'s , Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky told Nick Pasion of the Puget Sound Business Journal. “Our levels of capital are approaching that of major countries right now,” Olsavsky said. “So, just because the numbers are positive doesn't mean the challenges have diminished.” This year, Amazon is laying out $100 billion in capital expenditures on artificial intelligence — building out data centers, pioneering AI chips and investing in other companies. “With generative AI and all kinds of new challenges, there's really never a dull moment,” Olsavsky said. “The stakes are higher, the dollars are higher — millions turned into billions turns into trillions. A lot of the challenges remain, the numbers just get bigger.” A few days after Olsavsky's interview, CEO Andy Jassy shared a memo with employees saying that, as AI performs more tasks, fewer corporate employees will be needed. The memo echoed Olsavksy's take on the tech. Internally, he said Amazon's financial team is using AI for “finding errors, finding fraud, waste and abuses” in transactions. Personally, he said he uses it to parse through documents. ""When I look at all my tasks, not all of them can be handed off to ChatGPT, "" he said. “Maybe someday, in the near future, there will be a CFO agent that asks better questions than me, that makes better investment decisions than me, that heads off issues. But until that day happens, I get a lot of utility out of the experience that I have had here over 23 years.” FULL STORY"

1lq6ym1,2025-07-02 20:50:06,en,REDDIT,"  Hey, r/bonds. I'm an experienced journalist who **doesn't** have a lot of experience writing about financial matters. And I'm wondering if anyone can help me with some research I'm doing. I live in Rhode Island, a few miles from a quasi-private federal detention facility called the Donald Wyatt Detention Facility, which holds detainees — on a paid, per-diem basis — for two federal agencies: the U.S. Marshals and I.C.E. The Wyatt underwent a massive expansion project in the mid 2000s, and issued $106 million in bonds to pay for the project. Those bonds were called the CENTRAL FALLS DETENTION FACILITY CORPORATION DETENTION FACILITY REVENUE REFUNDING BONDS (THE DONALD W. WYATT DETENTION FACILITY), SERIES 2005A. (Based on [this document](https://www.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/letter.pdf?gaa_at=eafs&gaa_n=ASWzDAgQUBlR4w3x8i6Zi1u3qty6Jx1Kc3bU2pBuc7zdCHYtWyHINQe1oD9hhl7g2DE%3D&gaa_ts=6865972d&gaa_sig=B05asC9eG9X1VqqzY4vBlJjHdLS0LwWC4Yh2URNV9M4rsyb938_y4sfJnnuJ_YEU67ZYyAeYE8KCAkMzU6x3GQ%3D%3D), it appears that the CUSIP numbers were 153457AX4 and 153457BD7.) The bonds have become significant part of the story of the Wyatt since, in response to public outrage in 2019 about complicity with ICE, the board voted to expel ICE as a client. But the bondholders [sued for $130 million to keep ICE as a client of the facility](https://apnews.com/general-news-c4bc80945a1d47d8bea62af37db5bf08). and thus uphold the facility's fiduciary duties. That litigation is ongoing, and ICE remains a client of the facility, despite ongoing protests and opposition. What I'm trying to find (unsuccessfully so far) are any announcements or advertisements or prospectuses that prospective buyers would have seen when the bonds were first issued and upon which they would base their decision to invest. In other words: the documents from 2005 that explained to prospective investors what they were investing in. Are such documents available? And, if so, how might I access them? (I sent a FOIA to the board the governs the facility for such docs and came up empty.) Any help would be much appreciated!"
mov_434BE1882B2DFF4B3AA80218D2C608CE,2025-07-02 20:53:12,en,WEB,"  State-run health care websites around the country, meant to provide a simple way to shop for insurance, have been quietly sending visitors' sensitive health information to Google and social media companies, The Markup and CalMatters found. The data, including prescription drug names and dosages, was sent by web trackers on state exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act to help Americans purchase health coverage. The exchange websites ask users to answer a series of questions, including about their health histories, to find them the most relevant information on plans. But in some cases, when visitors responded to sensitive questions, the invisible trackers sent that information to platforms like Google, LinkedIn and Snapchat. The Markup and CalMatters audited the websites of all 19 states that independently operate their own online health exchange. While most of the sites contained advertising trackers of some kind, The Markup and CalMatters found that four states exposed visitors' sensitive health information. Nevada's exchange, Nevada Health Link, asks visitors about what prescriptions they use, including the names and dosages of the drugs, to help them find their best options for health insurance. When visitors start typing, it suggests specific medications, including antidepressants, birth control and hormone therapies. As visitors answered the questions, their responses were sent to LinkedIn and Snapchat, according to tests conducted by The Markup and CalMatters in April and May. On the other side of the country, Maine's exchange, CoverME.gov, sent information on drug prescriptions and dosages to Google through an analytics tool. It also sent the names of doctors and hospitals that people had previously visited. Rhode Island's exchange, HealthSource RI, sent prescription information, dosages, and doctors' names to Google. Massachusetts Health Connector, another exchange, told LinkedIn whether visitors said they were pregnant, blind or disabled. After being contacted by The Markup and CalMatters, Nevada's health exchange stopped sending visitors' data to Snapchat and Massachusetts stopped sending data to LinkedIn. Additionally, The Markup and CalMatters found that Nevada stopped sending data to LinkedIn in early May, as we were testing. The Markup and CalMatters discovered the sharing after finding that California's exchange, Covered California, told LinkedIn when a visitor indicated they were blind, pregnant or a victim of domestic violence. Experts said state health exchanges' use of advertising trackers was troubling if not entirely surprising. Such tools can help organizations to reach visitors and tailor ads for them. Google Analytics allows website operators to better understand who is coming to their site and to optimize ad campaigns. The LinkedIn and Snap trackers, like a similar offering from Meta, help companies target their social media ads. Nevada uses the trackers to help target marketing at uninsured residents, according to Russell Cook, executive director of the state agency that operates Nevada's exchange, Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. But health care services need to be especially careful with those tools, said John Haskell, a data privacy attorney who has previously worked as an investigator for the Department of Health and Human Services. “It doesn't surprise me that organizations that have these massive tech stacks that rely on third party-resources don't have a full understanding of what the configuration is, what the data flows are, and then once they go to somebody, what that data is being used for,” Haskell said. “It's something that needs to be addressed.” How was state exchange data tied to users' identities? After The Markup and CalMatters reported on Covered California's sharing of health data with LinkedIn, the exchange removed its trackers and said it would review its data practices. The news triggered a class-action lawsuit and questions from federal lawmakers. The Markup and CalMatters then examined websites operated by 18 states other than California, as well as Washington, D.C., to see what information they shared as users navigated them. The sites were established under the Affordable Care Act, which requires states to offer health insurance either through their own exchanges or one operated by the federal government. To test them, we first ran the sites through Blacklight, a tool we developed to reveal web trackers. We then reviewed network traffic on the sites to see what data the trackers received when visitors filled out forms. The results showed that 18 used some sort of tracker. Some were filled with them. Nevada, for example, used nearly 50. By contrast, Blacklight found no tracker of any kind on Washington, D.C.'s exchange. Popular websites use on average seven trackers, according to Blacklight scans of the 100,000 most trafficked sites on the web. Many of the sites used trackers in relatively innocuous ways, like counting page views. The four exchanges we found sharing sensitive health data sent varied responses to questions about the tracking. Cook said in a statement that trackers placed by his Nevada agency were “inadvertently obtaining information regarding the name and dosage of prescription drugs” and sending it to LinkedIn and Snapchat. Cook acknowledged such data was “wholly irrelevant to our marketing efforts” and said it had disabled tracking software pending an audit. Jason Lefferts, a spokesperson for Massachusetts Health Connector, said in a statement that “personally identifiable information is not part of the tool's structure and no personally identifiable information, not even the IP addresses of users of the tool, has ever been shared with any party in any way via this tool. "" But LinkedIn's tracker documentation makes clear that it correlates the information it receives with specific LinkedIn accounts so companies can use the data for features like retargeting website visitors. The company's documentation also states it later obscures this information and eventually deletes it. Spokespeople for the Rhode Island and Maine health exchanges said that they pay a vendor, Consumers' Checkbook, to run a separate site that allows visitors to explore what plans are available to them through their states' exchanges. It was from these sites that sensitive information was shared to Google. Consumers' Checkbook's sites are at different web addresses than the exchange sites, but are prominently linked to on the exchange sites and display identical branding like the state health exchange's logo, making it unlikely that an average visitor would realize they were no longer on a state-run domain. Christina Spaight O'Reilly, a spokesperson for HealthSource RI, said the company uses Google Analytics to study trends but not to serve ads, and “disables Google Signals Data Collection, ensuring that no data is shared with Google Ads for audience creation or ad personalization, and no session data is linked to Google's advertising cookies or identifiers.” HealthSource RI's terms of use mention the use of Google Analytics, she noted. A spokesperson for CoverME.gov made similar points, saying that the agency “does not collect or retain any data entered into the tool.” Consumers' Checkbook declined to comment beyond the exchanges' statements...."

The town has officially awarded its Boston Post Cane to its oldest resident, 101-year-old William (Bill) Morin, carrying on a New England tradition that's over a century strong. According to Bedford Town Manager Rick Sawyer, this is the 23rd cane the town has awarded and a beloved tradition in their town. The tradition The Boston Post Cane tradition began in 1909 when the now defunct Boston Post newspaper distributed over 700 canes to towns throughout New England in an effort to increase its circulation. Canes were distributed to Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island, but apparently none were given to Vermont or Connecticut. Inscription on the head of the cane Boston Post Canes were provided to hundreds of New England communities to be presented to their oldest residents. Written on the head of this cane is the inscription: ""presented by The Boston Post to the oldest citizen of Maynard, Mass (to be transmitted)"" Each cane was made of African ebony with a 14-carat gold head containing the inscription ""presented by the Boston Post to the oldest citizen of (the name of the town), to be transmitted."" The paper instructed selectmen to award the cane to the oldest male resident in each town as a gesture of respect. The catch? The cane must be passed down upon their death. The cane would belong to the town and not the man who received it. In 1930, eligibility for the cane was opened to women. Although the Boston Post folded in 1957, the cane custom remained a beloved ritual for most towns but was met with opposition by others. The controversy More in U.S. Some towns did not take to the quirky tradition, deeming it superstitious and a harbinger of death. Hampton was one of these towns. In an article in 1984 from the Hampton Union, the then-Town Clerk Jane Kelley said ""people started to fear getting the cane"" because ""the cane would be given out, and within a week, that person would be dead. It was awful."" Hampton officials also had a hard time determining the oldest resident and decided to retire the cane around 1974. Ashton Norton, a selectman at the time, said in the article, ""There was no way to find out who was the oldest or who was a native"" and ""we'd give the cane out, and we'd get complaints that we didn't give it to the right person. It got to be so much trouble the board decided to leave it in the town office building."" Hampton was not alone. Several towns also retired their cane, while others were stolen or lost. According to The Boston Post Cane Information Center, 516 towns reported as still having their canes. The locations of the rest are unknown. Eventually, many participating towns retired their original cane because of its antique value and created replicas for their recipients instead. What's happening now? Bedford was one of those towns. The original cane remains in the display case in the town office building with the names of the recipients engraved on gold rings encircling the case. Each recipient instead receives a full-size replica of the cane, which they can keep in perpetuity. When looking for their oldest resident, Bedford posts a notice requesting the names of residents who have lived in the town at least 10 years and who might be the oldest resident. The town then verifies the information of each applicant and determines the winning recipient. Town council hands Bill his cane Town Councilor Kathleen Bemis hands 101-year-old Bill Morin the Boston Post Cane, meaning he is now the oldest resident in Bedford. For Bill Morin, receiving the cane was an honor, according to his daughter, Marion Zayac. ""He couldn't believe it. He said to me, 'What do they want to give me that for?'"" Zayac said. ""He was very excited about it and is proud of receiving the Boston Post Cane."" Morin has been a resident of Bedford for over 50 years. He started several successful businesses and served his country in World War II. Sawyer said the Boston Post Cane tradition is an opportunity to reflect on the service of Bedford's longstanding residents. ""My favorite part about the Boston Post Cane tradition is learning about recipients and being able to celebrate their incredible lives and stories with the community,"" he said."

mov_35B95F54A25790DE8A2EED1037010B30,2025-07-03 00:53:49,en,WEB,"  The Rhode Island Airport Corporation (RIAC) has filed a declaratory judgment action seeking to prevent the reinstatement of a union president and former Airport Rescue and Fire Fighting lieutenant, citing a post-termination security breach and its federally mandated authority over secure airport access. The complaint, filed in Providence County Superior Court on July 2, 2025, targets former ARFF Lieutenant Steven R. Parent, who was terminated from T.F. Green International Airport's fire department on October 28, 2024. Parent was president of the Council 94 Local 2873, which represents firefighters, airport police officers, airfield maintenance, building maintenance, and clerical staff. According to the RIAC, Parent's termination followed allegations that he knowingly discouraged applicants from joining the department, thereby undermining its operations. The Rhode Island Current suggested that the airport's “undermining its operations” allegation was somehow associated with Parent benefiting by increased overtime due to ongoing vacancies. Following his termination, RIAC revoked Parent's security credentials and directed him not to enter any secure areas of the airport. The suit alleges that on November 1, 2024, Parent allegedly violated those directives by entering the secured ARFF station without authorization. The complaint alleges that Parent gained access to the firehouse with the help of a former subordinate, entered the station unescorted, retrieved a binder, and made vulgar gesture toward a deputy chief before departing. Parent has denied the allegations, and claims he returned to the station with advanced notice in order to obtain a copy of the union contract. According to the complaint, RI Council 94 for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) has filed a grievance over Parent's termination. Council 94 President Michael McDonald was quoted by the Rhode Island Current as saying that an arbitration hearing is scheduled in August, and the RIAC is “trying to avoid answering for what they've done.” The Current also states Council 94 filed an unfair labor practice against RIAC. In the suit, RIAC's alleges that access to secure airport areas is governed by a federally approved Airport Security Program (ASP) and subject to Transportation Security Administration (TSA) regulations. It argues that it has exclusive authority to issue and revoke security credentials and that Parent's actions on November 1, 2024, disqualify him from holding such credentials in the future. RIAC contends that if an arbitrator were to reinstate Parent to the ARFF Unit would violate federal law and compromise airport security. It also notes that the lieutenant position remains unfilled, creating a strain on staffing and increasing overtime costs. The corporation is seeking a judicial declaration that Parent cannot be reinstated due to his ineligibility for security credentials—a requirement for ARFF personnel.

It was the ultimate Desmoquattro and the best Ducati you could buy…” This iconic Ducati's from '97 and it's available for bid until 1PM PST on iconicmotorbikeauctions.com A limited edition of one of the prettiest motorcycles ever made, the Ducati 916SPS was an uprated version that featured a modified engine and chassis. The carbon fiber Termi exhaust (included separately with the SPS for “off-road use only”) sounded like nothing else people had heard at the time, and reviewers were terrified of the power delivery. Here's the key: this was the best Ducati you could buy in 1997 – and only 404 were sold that year. The best part of the whole story? The SPS was only road legal in Europe. Ducati didn't conform to EPA regulations, so they sold it as a 'track-only' bike and made buyers sign a waiver saying that you wouldn't register it for road use. As you might imagine, pretty much everyone ignored the waiver, as the bike came with a VIN, lights, a title, and everything needed to register the bike. The seller, Scott Billings, sent us all seven of his track bikes as he's moving out of the country for a number of years to start his retirement. Why did he have seven track bikes you ask? He wanted to participate in a range of classes throughout AHRMA's various groups (we're selling his race trailer as well here). He subsequently had the bike converted back to the street by Chris Boy at Moto Corse Performance in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

BC5B466CF4ED73561F961E788EF2C27E,2025-07-03 07:18:43,en,PRINT,"  The House remained frozen in place all day Wednesday as party leaders labored to address the concerns of Republican holdouts who were resisting changes the Senate made to the party's major policy bill. President Trump's marquee domestic policy bill was stalled in the House on Wednesday, with the chamber frozen in place as Speaker Mike Johnson labored to overcome resistance in his own ranks and push the measure to a final vote. After a day of private cajoling by Mr. Johnson at the Capitol and Mr. Trump at the White House, party leaders expressed optimism that they might soon be able to move ahead. But by early evening, they had yet to lock down the votes to do so, particularly among a bloc of fiscally conservative Republicans who were dismayed by its cost and demanding changes that could derail it altogether. ''I can't tell you I'm a yes; I can't tell you I'm a no,'' said Representative Ralph Norman, Republican of South Carolina, who huddled with about a dozen other holdouts in an office just off the House floor. Facing tight margins in the House, Mr. Johnson can afford only a small handful of defections on the legislation, which would slash taxes by a total of $4.5 trillion, increase funding for defense and border security and cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, with more reductions to food assistance for the poor and other safety net programs. It was the latest make-or-break moment for the speaker, who has seen other major legislative priorities imperiled by resistance in his own ranks and repeatedly teetering on the brink of defeat -- only to pull out narrow victories with the help of considerable pressure from Mr. Trump. With a procedural vote held open for much of the afternoon, Mr. Trump spent part of the day meeting with holdouts at the White House. Russell T. Vought, his budget director, who is close with the fiscal conservatives who were standing in the way of the bill, arrived on Capitol Hill late in the day to meet with them. ''I'm hopeful we can proceed tonight and get this done,'' Mr. Johnson said on Wednesday afternoon. Unlike in his prior down-to-the-wire efforts, when a flurry of negotiations and changes helped Mr. Johnson sway holdouts, the House has little room for maneuvering: Any changes to the bill would send it back to the Senate for negotiations that could drag on for weeks, potentially killing the enterprise altogether. The bill squeaked through the Senate by the narrowest of margins on Tuesday. But the changes that senators made to cobble together support for it exacerbated deep internal divides among House Republicans that have plagued their efforts to advance Mr. Trump's agenda since the beginning. Fiscal conservatives were demanding even deeper cuts to rein in the deficit, while politically vulnerable lawmakers whose seats are at risk during next year's midterm elections were wary of the biggest cuts to popular government programs. ''The Senate doesn't get to be the final say on everything. We've got to work this out,'' said Representative Chip Roy of Texas, a member of the Freedom Caucus. On Wednesday morning, he said there were enough Republicans ''right now'' who wanted to reopen the bill and were willing to blow through the July 4 recess to do so, suggesting that the votes would not be there to move it forward. And more moderate Republicans, many of them anticipating difficult re-election campaigns in swing districts, object to Medicaid cuts approved by the Senate that went deeper than those approved by the House in May. Members of both groups attended separate meetings at the White House on Wednesday where Mr. Trump and Republican leaders tried to persuade them to advance the bill. Ahead of one meeting, Representative Tim Burchett, an ultraconservative Republican from Tennessee, told reporters that he was pushing for a bill that addressed the deficit and adhered to the House's framework on cuts to taxes and social safety net programs like Medicaid and nutrition assistance. After the meeting, Mr. Burchett sounded more optimistic, saying in a social media video that Mr. Trump answered lawmakers' questions. '' We'll hopefully get this worked out and do some great things for this country,'' he said. It was not clear whether lawmakers' resistance would hold. Conservatives have repeatedly refused to back major legislation because of its potential impact on federal deficits, only to back down under pressure from Mr. Trump. Representative Victoria Spartz of Indiana, a notoriously fickle lawmaker, suggested that she would try to block the bill from coming to the floor, even as she planned to vote for it to pass. With the timing of any House action uncertain, Democrats raised a number of procedural roadblocks to register their opposition to the measure and slow its progress. ''When we say the Republican Party has turned into a cult, this is what we mean,'' said Representative Seth Magaziner, Democrat of Rhode Island. '' Our Republican colleagues are pushing a bill that would throw their constituents under the bus, a bill that flies in the face of everything they claim to stand for, all because Donald Trump wants a bill-signing photo-op by the Fourth of July.'' Emboldened by the G.O.P. rift, Democrats have made a point of projecting a united front while they railed against the bill and ramped up pressure on vulnerable Republicans. At a news conference on the House steps attended by a sizable portion of the Democratic caucus, Representative Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, the No. 2 House Democrat, called out Representative David Valadao of California, one of the most endangered Republicans. She questioned how he could back a bill that would slash Medicaid, a program that he has repeatedly voiced concern about. Mr. Valadao has said he cannot support the level of Medicaid cuts included in the Senate measure."

The House on Thursday was mired in paralysis, as Republican leaders toiled to put down a revolt within their ranks that had stalled their marquee policy bill and threatened to tank President Trump's domestic agenda. Dysfunction reigned on the House floor into the wee hours of Thursday morning, as a handful of Republicans withheld their votes to bring up the measure and Speaker Mike Johnson searched for a way to muscle through the sweeping legislation in the face of unified Democratic opposition. The overnight revolt marked a setback for Republicans who have worked tirelessly in both chambers to finalize and pass the measure in the face of sharp internal divisions. More than four hours after the G.O.P. called a five-minute procedural vote to call up the bill, the party was still short of the votes to do so, and the vote remained open. Mr. Johnson had spent all day Wednesday at the Capitol cajoling holdouts while Mr. Trump summoned some of them to the White House to twist their arms. But by early Thursday morning, they had yet to lock down the votes to move forward, particularly among a bloc of fiscally conservative Republicans who were dismayed by the bill's cost and demanding changes that could derail it altogether. ''What are the Republicans waiting for??? What are you trying to prove???'' Mr. Trump, clearly unhappy with how the events of the night were unfolding, wrote in a post on his social media platform. '' MAGA IS NOT HAPPY, AND IT'S COSTING YOU VOTES!!!'' The legislation would extend tax cuts enacted in 2017 that are scheduled to expire at the end of the year, while adding new ones Mr. Trump promised during this campaign, on some tips and overtime pay, at a total cost of $4.5 trillion. It also would increase funding for the military and border security and cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, with more reductions to food assistance for the poor and other government aid. And it would phase out clean-energy tax credits passed under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. that Mr. Trump and conservative Republicans have long denounced. Five Republicans joined all Democrats in opposing a procedural move to bring up the bill, more than enough to defeat it if none changed their mind. Another eight G.O.P. lawmakers refused to vote at all. But Mr. Johnson refused to concede defeat, instead choosing to keep the vote open well past midnight hoping that he and Mr. Trump could persuade enough Republicans to reconsider and allow the measure to move. Representative Keith Self of Texas, who voted against taking it up, said he was frustrated that Senate Republicans had strayed from the House's version of the bill, making it more costly and removing important policy provisions. ''Now, House leadership wants to cram this broken bill down our throats by rushing it to the floor while in the middle of discussions, completely disregarding their promises,'' he said in a social media post. Facing tight margins in the House, Mr. Johnson could afford only a small handful of defections on the legislation. This week's vote was the latest make-or-break moment for the speaker, who has repeatedly seen other major legislative priorities imperiled by resistance in his own ranks and teetering on the brink of defeat -- only to pull out narrow victories with the help of considerable pressure from Mr. Trump. In an interview on Fox News late Wednesday, Mr. Johnson maintained his optimism but acknowledged the process was likely to draw out, saying he would work for ''as long as it takes to make sure we've got everybody here and accounted for and all the questions answered.'' Unlike in his prior down-to-the-wire efforts, when a flurry of negotiations and changes helped Mr. Johnson sway holdouts, the House has little room for maneuvering: Any changes to the bill would send it back to the Senate for negotiations that could drag on for weeks, potentially killing the enterprise altogether.

mov_23C0075E8081BACDA7A8C8CAC39327CA,2025-07-03 09:02:42,en,WEB,"  The American history teacher in him comes out when Secretary of State Gregg Amore talks about plans for Rhode Island's celebration of the 250th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of Independence in 2026. Chairman of the independent commission that's coordinating local festivities, Amore ticks off highlights of Rhode Island's role in the battle for American independence. From forming the 1st Rhode Island Regiment, the nation's first integrated unit, to being home to two men (Stephen Hopkins and William Ellery) who signed the Declaration, the smallest state played a significant role in early America. “The majority of our cities and towns … contributed to the American Revolution,” Amore says. “This is a unique opportunity to unite all Americans. The Declaration of Independence is one of the most significant documents in world history and stands for human rights around the world. “The democratic – lowercase 'd' – document gives the people power.” The commission – with appointees from historical societies, tourism councils and period groups such as the Pawtuxet Rangers militia – will help Rhode Island tell its story, Amore adds. Drawing on $1 million the General Assembly allocated, the group will support efforts in each of the 39 cities and towns and by historical societies. Some celebrations and exhibits – a muster at Fort Adams in Newport and commemoration of the British bombing of Bristol – already kicked off the celebration. Others, like a Revolutionary War pop-up exhibit of archived items, will continue making the rounds across the state through 2026. “Brave Men as Ever Fought,” a painting depicting the 1st Rhode Island Regiment by artist Don Troiani, has been on display at the Rhode Island State House, on loan from the Museum of the American Revolution in Philadelphia. “The 1st Rhode Island Regiment is unique. Not only were they fighting for their freedom as slaves promised freedom for enlisting, they were fighting for the freedom of their country,” Amore says. “The goal is to make Rhode Islanders know what the 1st Rhode Island Regiment was.” While the painting returns to its Philadelphia home soon, the state commissioned a replica that will make scheduled stops across the state, Amore says. Also touring – protected by an archivist and a state trooper – will be the state's copy of the Declaration of Independence, normally kept in the State Archives. The painting and three printings of the Declaration (Southwick Printing from 1776, Goddard Printing from 1777 and Stone Printing from 1823) will be on display at the State Archives, 33 Broad St., Providence, on Friday, July 4, from 9 a.m. to noon. A state calendar for the semiquincentennial celebration hasn't been made public yet, but Amore spoke of such commemorations as: The Rhode Island Historical Society has started to celebrate, scheduling a “Roots of Revolution” walking tour, Aug. 9 from 11 a.m. to noon, from the John Brown House Museum, 52 Power St., Providence. Scott Alexander will lead a 1-mile exploration of the American Revolution's roots, talking about the Gaspee Affair, Act of Renunciation and Rhode Island as the first of the 13 original Colonies to renounce allegiance to King George III. Tickets are $16.88 ($10 for historical society members). In addition, the Newport Historical Society plans these events: More activities will be added, so check the websites of RI250 (rhodeisland250.org), which will soon post a map of historical sites across the state to visit; the Rhode Island Historical Society (rihs.org); and the Newport Historical Society (newporthistory.org/250th-anniversary) for updates. To get involved with the planning and execution of events, Amore suggests calling your city or town hall and asking for the contact person of your local 250th anniversary commission."

As a result, 11 people have lost their positions, but such cuts also will hamper the ability of public research universities to educate the working class and spur innovation in local economies, he said. “It's good to remember that the public research universities were really founded in the mid-1800s, and they were really set up to democratize education, to reach out to all communities so that not only the wealthy could go to university, but the working class could go to university,” Parlange said. At URI, about 30 percent of students are the first in their families to go to college, he said, and about 25 percent of students are eligible for the Pell Grants that help students with financial need attend college. Parlange wrote about the impact of the cuts in a recent Science magazine opinion piece, “An American research crisis with real human consequences.” “Universities with vibrant research communities are feeling the impact of growing hostility toward academia,” he wrote. “In recent years, higher education has been painted as out of touch with 'real America' — elite and disconnected. However, public research universities, like the University of Rhode Island (URI, where I am president), are by definition 'real America.'” On the podcast, Parlange said the cuts will have an impact on the opportunities for URI students. “These impacts will have real human consequences,” he said. “One of the things that I talk to parents about when they're coming with their children, thinking about coming to URI, is that a lot of our students get involved in research projects.” So, he said, “This is going to have consequences for all Rhode Islanders.” The Globe's sister publication, STAT, has written about how French universities are trying to attract US scientists as the Trump administration slashes funding for scientific research. Parlange — who held senior academic roles at universities in Switzerland and Canada and served as provost at Monash University in Australia — said US research universities had been attracting “the best and the brightest” from around the word. But if the US doesn't “make it straightforward for them to come,” talented students and professors can go to universities in Europe, Canada, Australia, and other places, he said. The Trump administration has canceled at least 60 grants for public health and scientific research in Rhode Island, primarily at Brown University and URI. Those cuts come at a pivotal time when state leaders are betting on the life sciences industry becoming a catalyst for Rhode Island's economy. Parlange said the the research cuts will end up hurting the economy of both the Rhode Island and the United States. Research universities have helped with advances in agriculture, smart phones, artificial intelligence, and biotechnology, he said. And URI researchers are among the world's experts on modeling and predicting the impact of hurricanes, he said. “I believe in the role of the research university,” Parlange said. “The ideas of the future will come out of the universities.” To get the latest episode each week, follow Rhode Island Report podcast on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, and other podcasting platforms, or listen in the player above."

The Trump administration may have relented this week in its effort to freeze $875 million of federal funds to build electric vehicle charging stations. The U.S. attorney general's office on Tuesday declined to appeal a court order from last week that freed a variety of states, from California to Rhode Island, to draw money halted in the first month of the Trump presidency. At stake is a fraction of the $2.7 billion that states had been expecting as part of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, which was created by the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law. The Biden administration designed the program to put chargers every 50 miles on major highways. The attorney general's office of Washington state, which led the lawsuit, said in a statement to POLITICO's E&E News, “Now that the injunction is in effect, we expect the Trump Administration to promptly comply with the order as we move our infrastructure programs forward.” But the Federal Highway Administration, which administers the program and is a defendant in the case, suggested on Wednesday that its fight isn't over. The Department of Transportation, which oversees FHWA and is also a defendant, “still can appeal the preliminary injunction and is currently coordinating its legal strategy with the Department of Justice,” FHWA said in a statement to POLITICO's E&E News. The Sierra Club, which led a group of nonprofitsthat joined the lawsuit, celebrated the ruling by Judge Tana Lin of the Western District of Washington. “The NEVI program is hugely consequential” in fostering an environment in which electric vehicles spread, said Joe Halso, the Sierra Club's lead attorney on the case. President Donald Trump put the NEVI program in his crosshairs in an Inauguration Day executive order, grouping it with Biden's other EV initiatives and seeking the “elimination of unfair subsidies and other ill-conceived government-imposed market distortions.” The Department of Transportation then froze the program in February, saying that funding would be withheld until it created new rules to replace Biden's. Those rules have not emerged, though on Monday, the administration suggested in a filing that it is preparing to do so. FHWA said on Wednesday that it is creating new guidance because the Biden version “was a disaster and failed miserably to deliver EV chargers.” Sixteen blue states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration in May, arguing that the freeze harmed them by paralyzing plans to deploy EV charging stations that they had painstakingly prepared. Lin took a harsh view of the government's actions last week and ordered the funding restored to 14 of the states. The states that could see their NEVI funding reanimated are California, Oregon, Washington, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Wisconsin, Delaware, Rhode Island, New Jersey, New York, Maryland, Hawaii and Illinois. The order doesn't apply to three jurisdictions that sued. They are the states of Minnesota and Vermont and the District of Columbia. Lin said in her ruling that they had not offered evidence of being harmed by the fund freeze. The drama isn't over. The government still has room to appeal, and proponents of the NEVI program have vowed legal action to resume the funding in all states. Halso said an appeal by the government is unlikely because it would have been tactically wiser for the Trump administration to object to the judge's order before it takes effect. EV charging stations now join a long list of targets of Trump executive actions that courts have overturned as illegal, from deportations of migrants to the freezing of university research grants.

Campbell has opened another front in her ongoing legal battle with the Trump administration, charging that the Republican White House exposed private health information as it prosecutes its mass deportation campaign. The lawsuit, filed by Democrat Campbell and 19 of her colleagues nationwide, in U.S. District Court in California's Northern District on Tuesday, names Health and Human Services Secretary Robert K. Kennedy Jr. and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi L. Noem as defendants. ""Disclosing individuals' private health data for the purpose of immigration enforcement puts lives at risk. These actions are yet another example of the Administration creating unnecessary fear and confusion among our residents,"" Campbell said in a statement. ""Congress has made it clear that emergency Medicaid coverage extends to all individuals, regardless of immigration status. I will continue to fight against cruel and unlawful policies that harm our residents,"" she said. Kennedy's advisers ordered the release of a dataset that includes the private health information of people living in California, Illinois, Washington state, and Washington, D.C., to the Department of Homeland Security, The Associated Press first reported last month. All of those states allow non-U.S. citizens to enroll in Medicaid programs that pay for their expenses using only state taxpayer dollars. The unusual data sharing of private health information, including addresses, names, social security numbers, immigration status, and claims data for enrollees in those states, was released to deportation officials as they accelerated enforcement efforts nationwide. The data could be used to help the Department of Homeland Security locate migrants in its mass deportation campaign, experts said. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who led the legal action, said the Trump administration's data release violates federal health privacy protection laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), the AP reported. ""This is about flouting seven decades of federal law policy and practice that have made it clear that personal healthcare data is confidential and can only be shared in certain narrow circumstances that benefit the public's health or the Medicaid program,"" Bonta said during a news conference on Tuesday. The Trump administration has sought to arm deportation officials with more data on immigrants. In May, for example, a federal judge refused to block the Internal Revenue Service from sharing immigrants' tax data with Immigration and Customs Enforcement to help agents locate and detain people living without legal status in the U.S. The lawsuit filed by Campbell and her colleagues asks a federal judge to block any new transfer or use of this data for immigration enforcement purposes. It argues that the administration violated a brace of federal laws, including the Administrative Procedure Act, Social Security Act, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Modernization Act, Privacy Act, and Spending Clause. The lawsuit also ""highlights that the Trump Administration's illegal actions are creating fear and confusion that will lead noncitizens and their family members to disenroll, or refuse to enroll, in emergency Medicaid for which they are otherwise eligible, leaving states and their safety net hospitals to foot the bill for federally mandated emergency healthcare services,"" Cambell's office said in its statement. Other states joining the legal action included Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington."

tw_sl_5da78be4f42c33a255d7d0bcf2f0f026,2025-07-03 13:57:52,en,WEB,"  C elebrities ARE venturing beyond the billboard and the big screen—and into big business. Hailey Bieber, a model married to Justin, recently sold Rhode, her make-up brand, in a deal valued at as much as $1bn. Skims, a shapewear label founded by Kim Kardashian, a reality- TV star, makes $1bn in annual sales and is expected to list on the stockmarket soon. Rihanna is now a billionaire not directly because of her music, but thanks to Fenty Beauty, her make-up label. Ryan Reynolds, a Hollywood actor, is active in everything from telecoms to online privacy. Surprisingly, many of these superstar businesses have become a source of innovative new consumer products. Celebrities have long used their fame to peddle things. Michael Jordan, a basketball player, is thought to have made over $1.5bn from his partnership with Nike over the past 40 years. Nespresso has reportedly paid George Clooney more than $40m to have his mug selling its coffee. Two decades ago Hulk Hogan, a professional wrestler, helped market the “Hulkster” cheeseburger, pre-cooked and frozen for your convenience. The practice continues. This week President Donald Trump launched “Victory 45-47”, a line of fragrances for men and women priced at $249, having launched “Fight Fight Fight” ($199) last year. By contrast, the new superstar brands put the A -list into capitalist. Ms Bieber and co are involved in operations and hold equity stakes of varying sizes in the underlying businesses. Many celebs have begun to rethink the value of traditional endorsement and licensing deals. Social media now give them a line straight to their fans. Direct-to-consumer distribution, meanwhile, has made getting a product to market easier than ever. Given that the real money is in building and owning a brand , rather than advertising, why not launch one instead? This thinking in turn is altering the life-cycle of consumer goods. Just as pharmaceutical giants acquire biotech startups to refresh their drug pipelines, so consumer giants are buying up the most successful celebrity brands. The match makes sense. The hardest part of building a brand is the first 100,000 sales, but the A -list has a fan base that is well disposed towards them and their wares. Once a celebrity brand gets off the ground, a consumer giant has the production and distribution networks to help it grow. Hence the series of deals. Among the first was Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics, a headphones and streaming business co-founded by Dr Dre, a music producer. Many were shocked when the tech giant, which prides itself on in-house research and design, paid around $3bn for the brand in 2014. More recently Diageo, a drinksmaker, has bought a tequila firm co-owned by Mr Clooney, in a deal valued at around $1bn, and a gin distiller partly owned by Mr Reynolds, for up to $610m. Obviously, a famous name is not enough on its own to get a second-rate product flying off the shelves. You need only peer into the bargain bin in any cosmetics shop to spot the remainders of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's beauty products, or Sarah Jessica Parker's scents. Some of Mr Trump's newest offerings may soon join them. According to a perfume-review website, Victory 45-47 for men is “not particularly memorable”. Shoppers today are quick to review products on social media. Fans might try a new lipstick or t -shirt produced by a celebrity. But they will not buy it a second time if they are disappointed. At their best, celebrity brands are innovative, creative—and lucrative for their owners. Yet, just like show business, brutal flops are possible, too. ■ Subscribers to The Economist can sign up to our Opinion newsletter , which brings together the best of our leaders, columns, guest essays and reader correspondence.

The fireworks are visible from anywhere on festival grounds. Independence Day commemorates the adoption of the Declaration of Independence by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776. In that document, the 13 original colonies declared their independence from Great Britain. During the pivotal summer of 1776, the pre-Revolutionary celebrations honoring King George III's birthday were replaced with as a symbolic break from the crown. It was an exciting time in Philadelphia — the Continental Congress voted to break from the crown and, two days later on July 4, the Declaration of Independence was adopted by the original 13 colonies —New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland. Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia — to adopt the Declaration of Independence. The first annual commemoration of the nation's independence was in Philadelphia on July 4, 1777, while the Revolutionary War was ongoing. Fireworks have been part of Fourth of July festivities since the first celebration in Philadelphia. Today, Americans celebrate with fireworks, parades, concerts, and family gatherings and barbecues. Celebrations, though, predate by centuries the designation of Independence Day as a federal holiday, which didn't happen until 1941. Get more local news delivered straight to your inbox.

mov_FE36FAE882676DC9960BB126132FFE9C,2025-07-03 15:27:43,en,WEB,"  PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Passing a new law restricting assault weapons took Rhode Island lawmakers more than 10 years, but it may offer a road map to other states looking to ease the proliferation of such firearms. For advocates, the fight is a prime example of the current challenges to passing gun control measures in the US, particularly surrounding semiautomatic rifles that have become the weapon of choice among those responsible for most of the country's devastating mass shootings. When Rhode Island's bill was signed into law by Democratic Governor Dan McKee late last month, its sponsor, Democratic Representative Jason Knight, told jubilant supporters: “What was once the impossible became the inevitable.” How? Persistent advocacy, a change in legislative leadership and a last-minute overhaul to note the broader legal landscape. What did Rhode Island do? Rhode Island's ban, which goes into effect in 2026, prohibits the sale, manufacturing and distribution of certain high-powered firearms that were once banned nationwide. The law does not prohibit possessing such weapons, a key distinction compared with other assault weapon bans enacted elsewhere in the US. Currently, only Washington state has a similar law. A leadership change helped propel momentum The assault weapons ban got a much-needed boost from Senate President Valerie Lawson, who secured the Senate's top spot in the middle of session after her predecessor, Sen. Dominick Ruggiero, died in April. Lawson turned to the bill's sponsors and others to find common ground between lawmakers in the House and Senate who remained split on how far the law should go. Lawson's endorsement was seen as critical to securing the bill's passage, whereas Ruggiero had previously deferred action, pointing instead to the need for Congress to act rather than a state Legislature taking the lead. “There are issues at certain points that meet the moment,” Lawson said. “I think it was the time for this.” Gun control advocates also acknowledged that banning assault weapons in Rhode Island hadn't previously been a top priority given that the state has largely been spared from national high-profile shootings that sometimes help propel legislative change. Assault weapons bans consistently face court challenges In the US, just 11 states and Washington D.C. have some sort of prohibition on certain high-powered firearms that were once banned nationwide. Rhode Island's version is the only one not yet facing a constitutional challenge — though a lawsuit against it is all but assured. Certain state legal battles are on hold until others make their way through lower federal courts. To date, none of the lawsuits have been completely thrown out, but the US Supreme Court is expected to have the final say. As Rhode Island lawmakers were in the middle of their gun debate, the high court declined to hear a challenge to Maryland's assault weapons ban — a move that some of the more conservative justices opposed. Justice Brett Kavanaugh even signaled that laws banning assault weapons are likely unconstitutional. “Opinions from other Courts of Appeals should assist this Court's ultimate decision making on the AR–15 issue,” Kavanaugh wrote, referencing a popular style of high-powered rifle. Yet the legal focus on banning such weapons often hinges on possessing firearms such as AR-15-style rifles and AK-47s, rather than on the distribution process. Rhode Island lawmakers hope that by tailoring their assault weapons ban to sales, manufacturing and distribution, they might will bypass the thorniest legal questions raised by the Second Amendment. What other states are doing Attempts to expand Democratic-dominated Hawaii's assault weapons ban to rifles in addition to pistols stalled this year. In New Mexico, Democratic lawmakers who control the General Assembly adjourned without taking up an assault weapon ban. In Rhode Island, advocates say their work isn't over. “It's progress,” said Melissa Carden, executive director of the Rhode Island Coalition Against Gun Violence. “But we know that a true assault weapons ban includes an enforceable ban on possession as well.” Defenders of Rhode Island's law bristle that their version could be considered weak. They point out that residents looking to purchase an assault weapon from nearby New Hampshire or elsewhere will be blocked. That's because federal law prohibits people from traveling to a different state to purchase a gun and returning it to a state where that particular of weapon is banned. “Some of my constituents have already called me and made comments about 'bad, bad bad, I'm going out and buying three and four of them now,'” said Sen. Louis DiPalma, the Senate sponsor of the statute. “Okay, come July 1st next year, you will not be able to do that anymore.”"

The new law also calls for three randomly selected police officers to sit on the panel. However, due to the timing, Hanley's case is the last to be heard by the three-member panel of officers under the old setup, according to Ragosta. And also worth noting that the Providence police were pretty clear where they stood on this issue: Providence police commander 'vigorously' dissents with majority -- O'Hara issued a seven-page dissent, disputing the majority's rationale and adding that it “sadly … does not align with my standards for holding errant officers accountable for blatant and willful misconduct.” “It is mind boggling that he launched into such a volatile, unrestrained tirade and a violent criminal assault on a prone and handcuffed Rishod Gore (“Gore”), who was suspected of committing a misdemeanor. Hanley's explosive reaction, insulting vulgarity, unhinged anger, and criminal physicality with Gore are a downright disgrace, fully inexcusable given Hanley's status and seniority,” O'Hara said. He concluded: “I must underscore that Hanley is a man prone to volatility, a man prone to violence, a man prone to vulgarity, a man prone to untruthfulness, and a man accustomed to lying. And yes, he is a man who has admitted to being a criminal. There is no place for him in any law enforcement agency. The bottom line: the majority has now burdened the Providence Police Department with an unfit individual, a criminal who will don a uniform again, and who is an inherent liability to our agency and the good people of Providence!” From an earlier story - [https://www.providencejournal.com/search/?q=hanley](https://www.providencejournal.com/search/?q=hanley)"

Bartram's son, William, gave the delegates a three-hour tour. Here's the interesting part: In his gardens, John Bartram had gathered trees, shrubs, and plants—many of them rare—from all thirteen colonies and managed to get them to thrive. Together. Large conifers from the northern colonies protected delicate species from colonies in the south. Leaves of those southern species protected the exposed, shallow roots of the northern trees.

mov_8BD045A24128136E4C63838FAA559045,2025-07-03 16:21:38,en,WEB,"  We live in a world so scientifically advanced that it's now technically possible to never leave the house, even for a doctor's appointment. That makes it possible to forget that we have serious agrarian roots. And not just in the production of food—critical to the rise and flourishing of any nation—but also in botany and the collection and studying of plants from around the world. Perhaps nowhere was this botanical connection more apparent than in the Philadelphia area. In the heart of the city, in 1784 David Landreth founded the D. Landreth Seed Company. During its long life, Landreth's supplied seeds and plants to the newly emerged states and abroad, as well as to every U.S. president from George Washington to Theodore Roosevelt. The area was also home to John Bartram, who in 1728 began work to create a botanical garden on the 120 acres he purchased in Kingessing. Bartram collected tree, shrub, and plant specimens from all thirteen colonies and bred plants for sale both in the colonies and in Europe. In 2003, entrepreneur Barbara Melera and her husband resurrected the D. Landreth Seed Company, which at that point was selling primarily grass seed. Today, Melera is part of Harvesting History, a company that specializes in heirloom species as well as time-tested tools and other gardening supplies. Each July, Melera reminds Harvesting History followers of a formative event in the foundation of the United States of America. Her short video series “The Constitutional Convention Story,” is based on a portion of the book “The Founding Gardeners,” by Andrea Wulf (2011). The story begins in May of 1787 in Philadelphia. Here gathered 55 delegates from 12 of the 13 colonies (Rhode Island boycotted the Convention), now organized under the Articles of Confederation as The United States of America. A key question dividing them was how to determine each state's representation. How would smaller states such as Connecticut and Delaware fare against much larger states like Virginia and North Carolina? Should votes depend on population? On wealth? As Melera recounts from Wulf's book, on July 14 after weeks of debating and deliberating, a number of the delegates escaped the excessively warm meeting room (windows were kept shut to prevent eavesdropping) to visit the nearby gardens of John Bartram. Bartram's son, William, gave the delegates a three-hour tour. Here's the interesting part: In his gardens, John Bartram had gathered trees, shrubs, and plants—many of them rare—from all thirteen colonies and managed to get them to thrive. Together. Large conifers from the northern colonies protected delicate species from colonies in the south. Leaves of those southern species protected the exposed, shallow roots of the northern trees. On the tour, did William point out the ways in which these plants from the different colonies benefitted each other? Did those lessons affect the delegates' votes the following day? As Wulf notes, “It can only be speculation that a three-hour walk … among the United States of America's most glorious trees and shrubs influenced these men.” But it's possible. At the least, it is a great reminder of our country's origin story and how the states eventually did come together to form “a more perfect union.” Quoting from the book, “The founding fathers' passion for nature, plants, gardens and agriculture is woven deeply into the fabric of America and aligned with their political thought, both reflecting and influencing it. In fact, I believe, it's impossible to understand the making of America without looking at the founding fathers as farmers and gardeners.” To watch the videos: Part 1 [embedded content] Part 2 [embedded content] Part 3 [embedded content] Part 4 [embedded content] You can of course also read Wulf's detailed and fascinating book. Note: Fifty acres of Bartram's original property remain today as Bartram's Gardens, the oldest botanical gardens in the United States. I recognize that this was land originally occupied by indigenous peoples. Pam Baxter is an avid organic vegetable gardener who lives in Kimberton.

mov_4D8E5C784C1EFF1FD301AF9FDC2BC70B,2025-07-03 16:41:58,en,WEB,"  The Defense Department continues to provide disaster response resources and capabilities as requested by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. Given the size and scope of the storm and its continuing impact throughout the eastern and northeastern United States, Pentagon officials said, the department is actively posturing forces to support civil authorities via U.S. Northern Command and the National Guard Bureau, with a particular emphasis on flood mitigation and energy restoration. Today, DOD has focused on providing recovery support as requested by FEMA in coordination with federal, state and local partners with a single set of objectives -- saving lives, providing shelter, and helping restore communities, officials said. About 10,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen are on duty supporting the governors in 13 Eastern Seaboard states. Dual-status commanders authorized to command both state National Guard and federal forces have been approved for Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island. The special status enables the commanders to effectively integrate defense support and capabilities the governors request, officials explained. The National Guard is working closely with state emergency response planners and providing input where necessary to identify and fill capability gaps. Guard forces under state control are assembling and staging personnel; providing communications, shelter, engineer, evacuation, security, and high-water vehicle support; high-water search and rescue; debris removal; and transportation. National Guard civil support teams are on stand-by for hazardous material response and providing a communications capability bridge between first responders and other local, state and federal agencies. In West Virginia, the National Guard is patrolling Interstate 68 for stranded motorists and assisting the power company with generators. Based on a request from the Department of Health and Human Services, DOD's U.S. Transportation Command airlifted about 120 medical personnel to New York City to augment medical staff providing care to nursing homes and at-risk elderly patients. Aircraft are standing by to support further missions, and medical personnel are being brought in from Colorado, Ohio and Texas. The Defense Logistics Agency is providing fuel, fuel transportation, commodities and expeditionary teams to support FEMA and the Energy Department. The Army Corps of Engineers has received 25 mission assignments from FEMA, with more than 400 people engaged to support the response mission. The Corps of Engineers' priority is support to the New York City flood mitigation mission, deploying technical assistance and senior leadership oversight while working to identify and deploy 100 high-volume water pumps to FEMA mobilization centers. This is in addition to the 100 water pumps U.S. Northern Command is sourcing at FEMA's request, officials said. The Corps of Engineers also is supporting states' and FEMA operations centers in three regions to organize response efforts. More than 20 team leaders or assistant team leaders have been alerted or deployed to provide public works and engineering expertise, such as damage modeling, storm surge modeling, and coastal preparations. Other planning response teams remain on alert for debris management, commodities distribution, infrastructure assessment, temporary roofing, critical public facilities, water planning, and temporary housing. Additional temporary power teams have been placed on alert status. Corps of Engineers senior leaders, power response teams, 249th Engineer Battalion Technical Assistance personnel and other technical experts are providing assistance at various locations. To support the emergency temporary power mission in New York and New Jersey, the Corps of Engineers has staged 200 generators at four locations to provide capacity beyond state's capabilities. FEMA will deploy them as they are needed, officials said. The Corps of Engineers is shipping 25 pumps from New Orleans and is meeting with other private pump suppliers to determine availability and capacity of pumps that could be delivered to the New York area. Upon receiving a temporary power mission assignment from FEMA, the Corps of Engineers has deployed four planning and response teams, the 249th Engineer Battalion, six emergency command and control vehicles/deployable tactical operating systems and a mobile command vehicle. The Corps of Engineers also received a mission assignment from FEMA to provide 80 truckloads of water to West Virginia. Army Corps of Engineers operations centers in affected districts have been activated, and emergency response assets are providing support around the clock, officials said. The Corps of Engineers also has assigned a liaison to the Energy Department and to the National Guard Bureau to coordinate combined response actions.

The president continues to direct FEMA Administrator William Craig Fugate to ensure that federal partners continue to bring all available resources to bear to support state, local, territorial and tribal communities in Hurricane Sandy-affected areas, the release said. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with those in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states who've been affected by this storm. We encourage individuals to continue to follow the direction of local officials so that first responders can focus on life saving efforts,” Fugate said in today's FEMA release. "" FEMA continues to provide the full support of the federal government for the life-saving and life-sustaining activities such as search and rescue, power restoration and debris removal that remains the top priorities of state, tribal and local governments.” Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta has directed that the Department of Defense provide any available disaster response resources requested by FEMA and state authorities as states throughout the Northeast begin to recover from Hurricane Sandy, the FEMA release said. DOD continues to coordinate with FEMA, U.S. Northern Command and the National Guard Bureau on providing lifesaving and life sustaining assets to FEMA and governors, as requested, the release said. U.S. Transportation Secretary Raymond H. LaHood announced in a DOT release issued today that he is making $13 million in quick-release emergency relief funds immediately available to New York and Rhode Island to help begin repairing the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, while assessments continue throughout the Northeast to determine the full extent of the damage. Also today, the president authorized an emergency declaration for New Hampshire, Virginia and West Virginia, the FEMA release said. The president also has authorized emergency declarations for Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. The president's actions, the release said, authorizes FEMA to coordinate all disaster relief efforts to provide assistance for required emergency measures, directly to state, tribal and local governments, to save lives and to protect property and public health and safety. Last night, the president declared major disasters for New York and New Jersey, making disaster assistance available to those in areas hardest-hit by the storm, according to the FEMA release. Currently, more than 1,900 FEMA personnel are working to support Hurricane Sandy disaster response and recovery operations, including search and rescue, situational awareness, communications and logistical support, according to the FEMA release. In addition, 28 teams comprised of 294 FEMA Corps members are onsite to provide aid and support. Nine federal urban search-and-rescue task forces have been staged along the East Coast and are deploying into affected areas as needed, and requested by impacted states, according to the FEMA release. An additional six federal urban search-and-rescue task forces have been placed on alert for potential activation if required. Fourteen Incident Management Assistance Teams and 12 liaison officers are positioned in affected states along the East Coast to support preparedness activities and ensure there are no unmet needs. Mobile Emergency Response Support personnel and teams have been deployed to support the states with secure and non-secure voice, video, and information services, operations, and logistics support to state response operations as well as with any potential requests for assistance, the FEMA release said. Ten FEMA disability integration advisors are also deployed to advise emergency management on alert and warning, evacuation, and sheltering needs. At all times FEMA maintains commodities, including millions of liters of water, millions of meals and hundreds of thousands of blankets, strategically located at distribution centers throughout the United States and its territories, including Atlanta, Ga. and Frederick, Md., if needed and requested, according to the FEMA release. FEMA distribution centers have an overall inventory of more than five million liters of water, three million meals, 900,000 blankets and 100,000 cots. FEMA and the Department of Defense established Incident Support Bases in Westover, Mass., and Lakehurst, N.J., to pre-position supplies, including water, meals, blankets and other resources closer to potentially impacted areas, should they be needed and requested by states, according to the FEMA release. FEMA has moved roughly 245,000 liters of water, more than 174,000 meals and thousands of blankets and cots to Westover Air Reserve Base; and more than 400,000 liters of water and more than 390,000 meals and thousands of cots to Lakehurst Naval Air Station in Lakehurst, N.J., and more commodities are en route, as weather conditions permit. States, localities and the American Red Cross continue to operate emergency shelters along the East Coast. In addition, the following federal activities are also being coordinated in support of Hurricane Sandy response and recovery efforts, according to the FEMA release: -- U.S. Northern Command Regional Defense Coordinating Officers and portions of the Defense Coordinating Element deployed in advance of the storm remain on the ground to validate, plan and coordinate potential Department of Defense support of FEMA's response operations and to facilitate DOD support of life-saving and response operations. -- There are now more than 7,400 National Guard forces on duty supporting the governors of New York, Massachusetts, Virginia, New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Rhode Island, New Hampshire and Maryland. These forces are providing assistance to local first responders and FEMA by providing assistance at evacuation shelters, conducting route clearance and search-and-rescue missions, and delivering of essential equipment and supplies. -- The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers mobilized temporary emergency power resources to provide support to areas affected by Sandy. These resources consist of teams with technical expertise to assess critical facility generator requirements and private sector contract support to install and operate generators. Other planning response teams remain on alert for debris management, infrastructure assessment, temporary roofing, water planning, and un-watering. Additional temporary power teams have also been placed on alert status. -- The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and FEMA activated ambulance contracts to support state requirements to evacuate patients as needed and requested. HHS has personnel deployed in support of state response efforts, including two 50-person Disaster Medical Assistance Teams providing triage and basic care in shelters in New Jersey. Additional medical teams are on alert. HHS also has personnel supporting 350 ambulances in New York that were activated through FEMA's ambulance contracts. An additional Disaster Medical Assistance Team remains pre-staged in the mid-Atlantic, prepared to deploy quickly along the East Coast if needed. -- The U.S. Department of Energy is working closely with FEMA, and in support of state and local officials who are responsible for working with utilities as they prepare for storms, deployed emergency response personnel to FEMA Regional Response Coordinati..."

Panetta has directed that the Defense Department provide any available disaster response resources requested by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and other federal agencies as affected states respond to Hurricane Sandy, according to a DOD news release issued today. The Defense Department continues to support FEMA and other federal partners, with U.S. Northern Command and the National Guard providing lifesaving and life-sustaining assets in the aftermath of the storm, according to the release. Per the release, here is today's update on DOD's response to Hurricane Sandy: -- As of 11:00 a.m. today, there are approximately 7,400 National Guard forces on state active duty or in the process of activating for duty in support of the governors of New York, Massachusetts, Virginia, New Jersey, Delaware, Connecticut and Maryland. These forces are providing critical assistance to local first responders and FEMA with support at evacuation shelters, damage assessments, route clearance, debris reduction and removal, search and rescue, and delivery of essential equipment and supplies. -- DOD has staged four medium rotary wing utility aircraft and four medium rotary wing search and rescue aircraft at Hanscom Air Force Base in Massachusetts, for potential logistical and search and rescue operations along the coasts of Massachusetts, Connecticut, and Rhode Island in support of FEMA. -- DOD has approved a request for District of Columbia National Guard support for traffic control points and high-water evacuations. -- DOD installations throughout the Northeast are available as requested by FEMA. These include Westover Air Reserve Base, Mass.; Joint Base McGuire-Dix, Lakehurst, N.J.; and Fort Devens, Mass. -- DOD has placed medium- and heavy-lift helicopters, para rescue swimmers, and aerial refueling aircraft on 24-hour prepare-to-deploy status in response to anticipated FEMA requests to mitigate or respond to the effects of the storm. -- Additional engineer units and logistical support units are preparing to support the response in anticipation of any requests by FEMA.

mov_26A23E842D9A6315C2E92FAC7A4885FE,2025-07-03 16:42:14,en,WEB,"  More than 7,400 members of the National Guard had been mobilized in 11 states to respond to Hurricane Sandy by 4:30 a.m. today and more are on the way. National Guard assistance to local first responders and the Federal Emergency Management Agency included support at evacuation shelters, route clearance, search and rescue and delivery of essential equipment and supplies. The focus of National Guard's missions is shifting to recovery in the aftermath of the storm. The governors of 12 states and the mayor of the District of Columbia had declared a state of emergency because of the storm, now downgraded to a post-tropical cyclone even as it made its way further inland and continued to wreak havoc in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia. Guard members were assembling and staging in Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Virginia, according to the National Guard Coordination Center, which monitors the response spearheaded by the states. In Connecticut, Guard members were responding to evacuation security support and high-wheeled search and rescue missions. High-wheeled vehicles were supporting civilian authorities in Maryland. In Massachusetts, a National Guard Civil Support Team was on stand-by for a possible hazardous materials response. In New Jersey, Guard members were assisting state police. In New York and Pennsylvania, they were assisting state emergency managers. In Virginia, citizen-soldiers and –airmen were assisting with debris removal. Each affected state was monitoring, assessing and responding as needed, and National Guard Bureau officials were monitoring and coordinating from the federal level. Army Gen. Frank J. Grass, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, briefed President Barack Obama on the National Guard response in support of state, local and federal agencies as part of a FEMA briefing on Oct. 28. On Oct. 29, Grass was in dawn-to-dusk meetings with senior National Guard leaders, FEMA officials, the adjutants general and the secretary of defense, among others, to monitor and respond to the storm that has affected millions of Americans. That all-out effort was continuing today. “We had to be ready to respond big and fast -- so the National Guard ramped up in multiple states this weekend preparing to support local, state and federal civilian authorities,” Grass said. “We are part of a whole-of-government response to support state, local and federal agencies tackling the effects of this storm.” National Guard officials were ready for the possibility of state requests for mutual aid. Emergency Management Assistance Compacts -- ratified by Congress and law in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands -- allow states to provide mutual aid if needed. “Additional Army Guard forces, from outside the immediate hurricane affected states, are prepared to meet gaps in essential functions, if requested,"" said Army Lt. Gen. William E. Ingram Jr., director of the Army National Guard. “Through mutual assistance agreements, Army National Guard ground and aviation task forces, from neighboring FEMA region states, are ready to meet gaps in mission command, medical, communications, logistics, transportation, engineering, civil support, maintenance, security and aviation,” Ingram said. In just one example of states helping states, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said the Wisconsin National Guard stands ready to assist civilian authorities supporting Hurricane Sandy relief efforts in the impacted regions. “Wisconsin's outstanding National Guard is ready to help those affected by Hurricane Sandy,” Walker said. “As our nation braces for this massive storm, Wisconsin is hoping for the best, but preparing for the worst. If resources are needed, Wisconsin stands ready to deploy the National Guard for assistance.” Some help was coming from the opposite side of the country: A Nevada National Guard 152nd Airlift Wing C-130 Hercules military transport aircraft and crew departed Oct. 29 for Moffett Field, Calif. to pick up a rescue boat, truck and several Guardian Angel Pararescue Airmen from the 129th Rescue Wing of the California Air National Guard. The aircraft and load were scheduled to depart the airfield near Sunnyvale, Calif., later Oct. 29 for Charlotte, N.C., to assist with relief efforts. The 152nd, called to duty by the Air National Guard Readiness Center Crisis Action Team, was expected to arrive in North Carolina late Oct. 29. States were indicating early today that all needs were currently met. The National Guard Bureau is monitoring the situation closely and coordinating with state, federal and local partners to ensure a coordinated and efficient response, Guard officials said. The National Guard -- the nation's first military responder -- supports the FEMA response and that of U.S. Northern Command, among other agencies. More than 85,000 National Guard members are available to assist civilian authorities in potentially affected states in support of relief efforts. Available National Guard resources include almost 140 rotary-winged aircraft to perform search and rescue, reconnaissance and personnel or cargo-carrying missions. Critical equipment available from the National Guard also includes 75 zodiac boats, 3,125 high-water vehicles, 43 Reverse Osmosis Water Purification Units, 3,535 generators and 726 debris-clearance vehicles. Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta agreed with the governors of Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts and Rhode Island to appoint dual status commanders as Hurricane Sandy approached, according to Defense Department reports. Dual status commanders can command both federal and state National Guard forces. This special authority enables them to effectively integrate defense support operations and capabilities requested by governors. Panetta is prepared to agree to similar requests from other states, the Defense Department reported. Governors warned of heavy rain, extensive power outages, significant flooding and dangerous conditions, according to National Guard Coordination Center reports. A state of emergency typically mobilizes resources to local governments that otherwise are restricted to state use only and suspends regulations that would impede rapid response. It also empowers emergency managers to use all available resources and personnel as deemed necessary. The Nevada and Wisconsin National Guard contributed to this article.

Email tips@dailymail.com Abbey Clancy's daughter Sophia showed she has taken after her model mother as she joined her famous family and footballer father Peter Crouch at the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club for day four of Wimbledon on Thursday. The daughter to the famous couple, 14, showed off her resemblance to her mother as she was seen topping up her lip gloss in the crowd. She joined Abbey, 39, and Peter, 44, who looked happier than ever and packed on the PDA with a kiss while sat in Centre Court, as she stepped out in an all white ensemble. For the outing, Sophie put on a very glamorous display as she toted her belongings around in a black leather Miu Miu bag. It appears that she also has her mother's eye for designer accessories, as she accessorised with four Christian Dior cloth bracelets, each worth a whopping £250. To finish her sporting day outfit, Sophia was seen wearing false eyelashes as she applied a layer of Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip gloss. Meanwhile Abbey - who is also a mother to Liberty, nine, Johnny, seven, and Jack, five - looked incredible for the outing as she wore a yellow striped suit. Liverpool football legend Peter, looked handsome as he attended the event in a casual blue shirt. Abbey has had a highly successful modelling career, while she's also branched out into presenting, novel writing and even won Strictly Come Dancing back in 2013. And Sophia has taken nepotism in her stride as she made her modelling debut aged eight when she joined Abbey for a Lipsy shoot. Sophia has reportedly had 'loads of offers' already from agencies as she is being dubbed the 'next Lila Moss' A source told Heat World: 'Sophia is getting lots of offers from modelling agencies. They see her as the next big thing, thanks to her looking like Abbey and having Pete's height. 'She has already done campaigns with her mum, but now big-name agencies are desperate to sign her and turn her into the next Lila Moss.' Centre Court spectators will be watching Jack Draper compete against 2017 Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic and Dan Evans takes on Novak Djokovic. Draper, the current world No4, takes on 2017 Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic this afternoon as he looks to progress past the second round for the first time at SW19. World number one Jannik Sinner is also back in the spotlight, up against Aleksandar Vukic, whilst Iga Swiatek plays Caty McNally in the other Centre Court match. Judy Murray has opened up on the secrets of the Royal Box at Wimbledon as celebrity guests continue to flood into Wimbledon. While there are 18 Championship grass courts at SW19, all eyes are often on the historic Centre Court, which plays host to the best stars the sport has to offer as they compete for glory. Centre Court boasts nearly 15,000 seats, meaning lucky punters can be seen cheering on their favourites, and are joined by guests in the Royal Box at around lunchtime each day. So far this week, the likes of John Cena, Thomas Tuchel and Olivia Rodrigo have all been present, with all three part of a star-studded line-up in the Box on Wednesday. On Tuesday Judy, renown for her coaching work in the sport and her support for tennis-playing sons Andy and Jamie, made an appearance. Before her trip, she opened up on what it is like in the Royal Box on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with The National Lottery on Virgin Radio UK. 'Royal Boxing should be a verb, shouldn't it?' she said.' It should be a summer verb.' She added: 'Well, you arrive usually around 11.30, so you go upstairs, they have a champagne reception, then you go in for lunch and you could be sitting beside absolutely anybody at lunch. There's no seating plan, it's just as you go into the room. 'It's in the clubhouse of the All England Club, and the first year that I went I took my mum, of course, and we sat with Jack Nicklaus. I sat with a few years ago a lady who was the first female Spitfire pilot. I mean it's just you could be with absolutely anybody and the stories are fascinating. 'It's really tough when the sun comes round because there's no escape. 'It's actually I think worse for the guys because they have to wear a jacket and tie and they're not allowed to take the jacket off unless the royalty in the box takes their jacket off first. That's the protocol.'"

1lqv0dm,2025-07-03 17:08:37,en,REDDIT,"  **Rev. War PVT Levin Benson of Delaware (searching for service records)** Hi Folks! I have been researching the life and Revolutionary War Service of my ancestor Pvt. Levin Benson of Kent County, Delaware, but have hit a brick wall attempting to locate any further proof of his rev. war service. So I felt it was time to share this search with you fellow sleuths! :) The only current  source of service is his own Pension Application affidavits in 1832. He did not supply any documentary proof and stated none exists to his knowledge. The family continued to claim his pension and repeated his story of service well after his passing. I know it was possible to receive a rev. war pension without documentary proof using witness attestations. So to be honest I am worried his pension story and lack of proof may imply he did not actually serve as stated. I know there were many questions at the time regarding rev war pension fraud. How common is it for there to be rev war pensioners where no other service records survive? (I know the war of 1812 led to the loss of many records.) Does anyone know of the Delaware company he served with? Captain William Hudson under Colonel John Rhodes of the Delaware Line. I have not found this colonel in the Delaware records so far but have found men sharing the name. I recognize these affidavits were made 50+ years after the war which is likely why these pension affidavits often contain questionable information, so I am trying to keep an open mind when analyzing his affidavits. **Brief Life Story:** Levin Benson attests he was a Private in the Delaware Line. He was born in Kent County, Delaware. After his service he moved to Rowan, North Carolina abt. 1790-1796 and then to Lincoln County, Tennessee anywhere between 1796 - 1820 where he lived the rest of his life until 1836. WikiTree Profile:[ https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Benson-6351](https://www.wikitree.com/wiki/Benson-6351) Below is, to my current understanding, the basic events of his service recollected in his pension application: **Timeline of Service:** Revolutionary War Pension and Bounty Land Warrant Application File W.329, Levin Benson, Del. -[ https://catalog.archives.gov/id/53955487?objectPanel=extracted](https://catalog.archives.gov/id/53955487?objectPanel=extracted) *transcript available Approx.

tw_sl_df4a8659034f9d7b37d6286b956ccb46,2025-07-03 17:46:34,en,WEB,"  PROVIDENCE — James “Jim” S. Bennett will serve as the next interim secretary of Rhode Island Commerce, the state's economic development agency, according to Governor Dan McKee's office. “I look forward to bringing over 40 years of business experience to this position,” said Bennett. “I'm honored the Governor has asked me to fulfill this role, and I look forward to helping the government move at the speed of business. I'm excited about the challenge.” Bennett, who was the executive vice president of Prospect Medical Holdings from 2015 to 2023, has served as president and chief operating officer of Rhode island Commerce Friday. As Commerce secretary, Bennett is expected to work on deals to bring larger corporations and firms to Rhode Island, and is expected to focus on the continued redevelopment of the long-vacant “Superman” building from office space to hundreds of apartments. (The developer is awaiting millions of dollars from the Trump administration). While serving as president and CEO of Commerce, Bennett was credited for bringing Canton, Mass.-based Organogenesis Holdings Inc., a regenerative medicine company, to Rhode Island. As part of the deal to open a new manufacturing facility in Smithfield, the state will provide the company with nearly $20 million in tax incentives over the next decade. From 2011 to 2015, Bennett served as Providence's director of economic development. He also served on the board of directors of the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority on and off from 1995 until he abruptly resigned as chairman in 2015. Bennett has also worked in the private sector as the executive vice president of Prospect Medical Holdings from 2015 to 2023. The California-based hospital chain runs two cash-strapped hospitals in Rhode Island — Our Lady of Fatima Hospital and Roger Williams Medical Center. He reported directly to Prospect's CEO, Sam Lee. Both Lee and Prospect were under investigation by a Congressional Senate committee previously chaired by US Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. Prospect filed for bankruptcy earlier this year; Lee stepped down as CEO in 2023. Bennett is the founder of Madison Components LLC, a New Hampshire-based distributor of electronic components and independent reseller of refurbished hardware that is now closed. He also founded Mitkem Corporation and Ceimic Corporation, both of which operate environmental testing labs; and investment banking firm Albert, Bennett & Co. The investment firm's registration with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority was cancelled in 1988 — five years after it was founded. He was also candidate for state treasurer in 1998 and governor in 2002. He lost in the Republican primary to Donald Carcieri, who went on to serve as governor from 2003 to 2011. Bennett graduated from Brown University in 1979, where he played hockey. He was inducted into the school's Athletic Hall of Fame in 2000. He is registered to vote in Narragansett, R.I., and owns property in Florida, according to a copy of his financial disclosure filed with the state, which was obtained by the Globe. Bennett replaces Liz Tanner, who has served as the state's commerce secretary for three years and officially steps down on Friday. She will soon lead Ocean State 2026, a new nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring the state maximizes the economic opportunities of next summer's World Cup. Tanner focused on small businesses during her tenure, and was tasked with helping pull Rhode Island out of a post-pandemic slog, overseeing the development of the Tidewater soccer stadium, and assisting businesses that faced disruption after the Washington Bridge closure. Prior to Tanner, Stefan Pryor served as commerce secretary for more than seven years under former governor Gina Raimondo. Pryor focused on redeveloping the long-vacant Superman building, and trying to attract major corporations to the state through the use of tax credits."

Ele irá competir no Hall of Fame Open, que começa neste domingo, 9, em Newport, Rhode Island, nos Estados Unidos. Para alcançar essa marca histórica, Ackman formou uma dupla de peso com Jack Sock, medalhista de ouro olímpico e vencedor de Grand Slam. Juntos, Ackman e Sock têm a possibilidade de conquistar até 125 pontos no ranking do evento Challenger, que normalmente é reservado para jogadores com classificações mais baixas. Em contraste, os vencedores de um Grand Slam podem somar até 2.000 pontos, mostrando a disparidade entre os diferentes tipos de torneios. Embora tenha planejado inicialmente competir em um torneio da ATP ao lado de Nick Kyrgios no começo deste ano, os planos de Ackman foram adiados devido a uma série de lesões que afetaram o ex-finalista de Wimbledon. Segundo reportagem da Fortune, o investidor está disposto a fazer história e em treinamento. O interesse de Ackman pelo tênis vai além da participação em torneios. Ao longo dos anos, ele tem investido em iniciativas para apoiar jogadores profissionais, auxiliando-os a buscar oportunidades de negócios fora das quadras. Ackman competitivo A natureza competitiva de Ackman, que o levou a investir em esportes e iniciativas no tênis, também se reflete em sua própria vida. Essa característica ficou bastante evidente em uma história que se tornou quase uma lenda urbana. No início dos anos 2010, Ackman decidiu se juntar a um grupo de ciclistas, incluindo o também bilionário Daniel Loeb, para um passeio em Hamptons, uma região luxuosa de Nova York. Apesar de Loeb ser um ciclista experiente, Ackman admitiu que havia passado o verão inteiro sem andar de bicicleta, mas estava determinado a acompanhar o grupo. O passeio inicialmente planejado para ser tranquilo rapidamente se transformou em uma competição, com Ackman disparando para a frente e sendo seguido pelos outros ciclistas. Depois de 51 quilômetros, Ackman foi ultrapassado por todos, completamente desidratado e sem energia, sendo guiado por um dos ciclistas de volta para Hamptons, enquanto gritava de dor. A história de Ackman no ciclismo reflete seu comportamento impetuoso e competitivo. Ele não conseguiu aceitar os limites de seu corpo e forçou-se ao máximo para ser o mais rápido, sem definir um ritmo sustentável. Agora, parece que ele está disposto a mudar essa história, focando em equilíbrio e longevidade, enquanto tenta conquistar um feito inédito no mundo do tênis. 1/10 CUPERTINO, CA - SEPTEMBER 12: Tim Cook opens the Apple's annual product launch, Wednesday, Sept. 12, 2018, at company headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.

In Swift's 12 years of owning a home in Rhode Island, she has thrown five celebrity-packed Independence Day parties, most recently hosting the traditional bash in 2023. While the popstar was touring during the holiday last year, this year, Swift has no known events that coincide with July 4, meaning that while nothing is confirmed, there is a chance Rhode Island may see another Taymerica celebration this year. Here's what we know so far. Is Taylor Swift in Rhode Island right now? LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA - FEBRUARY 02: (FOR EDITORIAL USE ONLY) Taylor Swift attends the 67th GRAMMY Awards on February 02, 2025 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/) ORG XMIT: 776216135 ORIG FILE ID: 2197311646 No. For now, it seems like Swift is enjoying her break from touring by traveling the country with her boyfriend Travis Kelce. According to reports on , Swift was most recently seen on Tuesday, July 1 in Ohio, where she and Kelce enjoyed a lunch date at JoJo's Bar in Chagrin Falls, near the Cleveland area where Kelce grew up. Before that, in the West Village of New York City on Saturday, June 28, following a June 24 appearance at Nashville's Tight Ends & Friends, a charity concert hosted by Tight End University, where Swift put on a surprise performance of ""Shake it Off."" If Swift is still in Ohio, it may be unlikely that she is traveling all the way to Rhode Island for July 4. However, there is still a chance, as the long travel is nothing the star hasn't done before. In fact, in 2024, after playing an Eras Tour concert at Japan's Tokyo Dome on Saturday, February 10, Swift traveled across the world to Las Vegas to attend Super Bowl LVIII on Sunday, February 11. However, her house is currently undergoing renovations, which is another reason she might not make it there this 4th of July. Taylor Swift's Fourth of July celebrations Over the years, Swift has become known for her iconic Independence Day bashes in Rhode Island, dubbed ""Taymerica"" parties by her fans. After buying her Rhode Island house in 2013, Swift threw parties for the holiday for four years in a row, hosting members of her ""squad"" like Blake Lively, Gigi Hadid, Cara Delevingne, Ed Sheeran, Lena Dunham and Emma Stone. More in Celebrity From 2017 to 2022, Swift took a break from celebrating the Fourth in Rhode Island, leading many fans to question if the singer's holiday tradition was over. However, in 2023, Taylor Swift once again returned to Rhode Island for July 4, celebrating with Selena Gomez and Haim sisters Este, Alana and Danielle. ""Happy belated Independence Day from your local neighborhood independent girlies,"" Swift captioned an featuring pictures of the friends posing in front of the water, laughing in the kitchen and enjoying red, white and blue popsicles. Last year, the popstar was unable to throw a Rhode Island party due to being in Europe for the Eras Tour, where she played a show at Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam on July 4, 2024. Instead, Swift returned to her New England mansion in August 2024 for a late summer bash in honor of Blake Lively's birthday, which was attended by Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds, Bradley Cooper, Travis Kelce, Jason and Kylie Kelce and Patrick and Brittany Mahomes. Where is Taylor Swift's house in Rhode Island? Taylor Swift's oceanfront mansion in the Watch Hill section of Westerly, Rhode Island, on Jan. 16, 2025, as it undergoes renovations.

The weeklong annual convention included organizational business meetings along with gala award ceremonies recognizing honorees from around the world for their efforts in historic preservation, education and patriotism, the three pillars of the DAR mission. June 28 was the DAR National Defense Night Ceremony, which featured a keynote address by counterterrorism expert and former CIA Analyst Gina Bennett who received the DAR Patriot Award. Bennett, a former CIA Senior Analyst had a 30-year career in the U.S. Intelligence Community and is known for authoring the first warning on Osama bin Laden as well as contributing to decades of research that ultimately led to the Navy Seal team finding him in 2011. She is a champion for inclusion and recognition for women in the national intelligence and security community. During the ceremony, it was announced that in the spring the DAR surpassed the $1 million threshold in cumulative giving to the Military Women's Memorial, underscoring the decades-long collaboration of the two women's organizations in their dedication to honor and tell the stories of women servicemembers. Phyllis Wilson, President of the Military Women's Memorial, surprised the DAR President General Pamela Wright with their Woman of Valor Award in recognition of her enduring commitment, steadfast support and lifetime of leadership honoring and advancing the legacy of America's military women past, present, and future. Another highlight of the ceremony was celebrating the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the all-female African American battalion during World War II that boosted troop and home front morale while enduring harsh conditions and delivering a huge backlog of mail. Colonel Edna W. Cummings, US Army (retired), and Master Sergeant Elizabeth Helm-Frazier, US Army (retired), were both presented with the DAR Medal of Honor, each for their more than 25 years of service in the military and for their steadfast advocacy for the recognition of the 6888th Battalion. The DAR Media and Entertainment Award was also presented to the Netflix film, The Six Triple Eight, with a video acceptance from one of the stars of the film played during the ceremony. Other military-related awards bestowed on Saturday evening were: The Margaret Cochran Corbin Award (for distinguished service by women in the military named for ""Captain Molly,"" who took over her husband's cannon during the Battle of Fort Washington in 1776) – to Chief Master Sergeant Tiffany Zaloudek, who in 2024 was the first female SERE (survival, evasion, resistance, escape) specialist to earn the highest enlisted rank in the Air Force. CMSgt Zaloudek earned her beret in 2007 and broke an eight-year dry spell in which no women had graduated from the SERE training course. The Dr. Anita Newcomb McGee Award/Army Nurse of the Year (named for DAR's first Librarian General, Dr. McGee, who directed the DAR Hospital Corp during the Spanish-American War and later, while Acting Assistant U.S. Surgeon General, founded the Army Nurse Corps) – to Colonel Wendy Woodall, U.S. Army Nurse Corps. In 2023, Colonel Woodall was appointed as the Director for Nursing Services and currently serves at the Chief Nursing Officer at Walter Reed Medical Center and the Medical-Surgical Nursing Consultant for the Surgeon General of the U.S. Army. The DAR Service for Veterans Committee awards were presented to the National Outstanding Youth Volunteer, Jacob Weber, National Outstanding DAR Member Volunteer, Judi Rotar, and the National Outstanding Veteran Volunteer, Ronald Wroblewski, for their service and commitment to veterans. The Education Awards Ceremony on Thursday evening, June 26, featured multiple awards recognizing excellence in education. Dr. Jennifer Bratyanski received the DAR Outstanding Teacher of American History Award. Dr. Bratyanski is an AP Government and U.S. History teacher at Providence Day School and professor of American Studies at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte. Out of thousands of submissions from across the country, awards were presented to the National DAR American History Essay Contest finalists, including new categories for the first-ever video essay contest. The topic for this year's essay contests focused on students imagining the lesser-known Revolutionary Era Edenton and Wilmington Tea Parties, which were led by women, and why they would have chosen to join these brave leaders. Awards for the Patriots of the American Revolution DAR High School Essay Contest and the National DAR Good Citizens Award were also presented. The Opening Night Ceremony of the 134th Continental Congress on Wednesday, June 25, featured remarks from Rosie Rios, the chair of America250, the non-partisan initiative behind the U.S. Semiquincentennial Commission established by the U.S. Congress and leading the celebrations in 2026 marking the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The following award winners were recognized by the DAR during the Opening Night Ceremony: The President General's Medallion was presented to Chuck Leavell for his work in community service and environmental stewardship. In 1981, after tenures as a musician with the Allman Brothers, George Harrison, and others, Leavell joined the Rolling Stones and has toured with the band as their lead keyboardist and music director for 47 years. The same year he joined the Rolling Stones, Leavell and his wife Rose Lane, inherited 1,200 acres of farmland – and he turned to a new passion for environmental advocacy and forestry stewardship. The DAR Founders Medal for Education was presented to Kali Reis, two-time world boxing champion, actor, and advocate. Reis notably appeared in True Detective: Night Country, for which she received an Emmy nomination for Best Supporting Actress, one of the first two Indigenous women to ever be so nominated. As a proud Indigenous woman, Reis uses her roles both in the ring and on camera to advocate for Indigenous women. The assembly also celebrated Reis becoming a new DAR member, tracing her Revolutionary War Patriot to Primus Slocum, an enslaved man of color who served as a Revolutionary War soldier in the 1st Rhode Island Regiment, who was later granted personal freedom due to his service, and married and started a family with Mary Cleghorn, an Indigenous woman. The President General's Medallion was presented to the Italian cultural organization, Circolo Culturale Filippo Mazzei, for its efforts to promote the legacy of Filippo Mazzei, an Italian physician, merchant, and writer who played a significant role as an American Patriot during the Revolutionary War, arranging for loans and supplies to aid the American cause. The DAR Medal of Appreciation was presented to Italian artist Luciano Massari for his work carving a commissioned sculpture of Mazzei, the Italian philosopher, diplomat, and close friend of Thomas Jefferson who is credited with being the first to phrase the belief that ""all men are created equal."" The Community Service Award was presented to Jeff Callaway, the founder of Ethan Almighty's Blessings Inc., a non-profit dedicated to animal welfare.

But in the context of a reputable seafood restaurant, especially one that prides itself on sourcing, this question can land pretty awkwardly. It's a not-so-subtle insult to the very premise of the establishment, which isn't the best way to begin a nice dinner out. If that scenario seems exaggerated, just listen to what Kevin O'Donnell, chef and owner of Giusto, has to say. With locations in Providence food hall Track 15 and Newport, Rhode Island, O'Donnell is very familiar with serving fine seafood. ""I think this is just a sign that maybe you have had some bad experiences at restaurants with fish that was not fresh,"" he suggests. ""If you are going to a well-established and respected restaurant I think it's safe to assume that the fish will be fresh."" For many diners, ""fresh"" connotes something that was pulled from the ocean that morning and tossed onto a plate by dinnertime. That's a romantic idea, but one that's more fantasy than it is a reality, unless you're at a seafood shack off the coast of Maine picking out your own lobster. In this era of global supply chains, along with the sophisticated ways restaurants store fish to keep it fresh, many high-end seafood restaurants don't rely on just-caught timelines. Reputable seafood restaurant chefs usually work with trusted purveyors, sourcing the best product available in season and at peak quality. And, in many cases, fresh isn't always better than frozen. Disrupting The Rhythm Of Restaurant Hospitality A variety of fresh seafood displayed on ice - Cook Shoots Food/Shutterstock Kevin O'Donnell affirms the high quality of adequately frozen fish. ""Freezing the proper way in a blast freezer can many times produce a better quality fish. When fish is frozen slowly, the water expands as it freezes and denatures the protein cells, making the fish soft and soggy after it thaws,"" he explains. ""Freezing fast in a blast chiller preserves all of the good qualities about the fish, and if done on the boat, can provide a better quality finished product. It also kills parasites and can be a safer way to consume fish, especially when eaten raw."" If you've chosen a seafood-forward restaurant that takes pride in its craft, you can assume it's not risking a business license or reputation by serving seafood that isn't fresh. In other words, don't freak out if Alaskan halibut is on the menu, but you're in California. ""I don't think there is any menu terminology that would reveal if the fish was frozen. Even fish coming from far away can be fresher depending on the distributor and how it was handled to begin with,"" O'Donnell advises. ""I would prefer to eat fish that was frozen properly over fresh fish that was mishandled and sitting in a refrigerator on ice for seven days."" Dining well is about so much more than what's on the plate. It's about understanding context, respecting craft, and engaging with food as something more than a transaction.

mov_1DEB781165347019C6D683EF78BA0E54,2025-07-03 19:23:43,en,WEB,"  Listen to this article 20 states, led by California, sue HHS and DHS for unlawful data sharing Medicaid data allegedly given to ICE without public notice or consent Lawsuit cites violations of HIPAA, the Privacy Act, and APA Rhode Island Attorney General Neronha warns of chilling effect on healthcare access Rhode Island is part of a coalition of 20 Democratic-led states, spearheaded by California Attorney General Rob Bonta, that has filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Homeland Security unlawfully shared sensitive Medicaid data with immigration enforcement authorities. The complaint, filed July 1 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, names HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem as defendants in their official capacities. At the heart of the case is an alleged data handoff between HHS's Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and DHS's Immigration and Customs Enforcement involving protected health information from millions of Medicaid recipients — information plaintiffs assert was shared “without notice, opportunity for public input, or reasoned decision-making.” The complaint warns the data was transferred “in violation of federal law,” and that CMS has “handed over a trove of individuals' protected health data obtained from States, including California, Illinois, and Washington, to other federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security.” The plaintiffs argue that the move violates multiple federal statutes, including the Administrative Procedure Act, the Social Security Act, the Privacy Act of 1974, HIPAA, and the Federal Information Security Modernization Act. They also claim the data transfer undermines the foundational trust between Medicaid beneficiaries and the state programs that serve them. “If members of our community cannot trust that the government will keep their medical history and other personal data safe, they will think twice about going to the doctor when needed,” the complaint states. While CMS claimed it shared the data “to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them,” the plaintiffs say this justification is both factually and legally unsupported. They contend that Congress has already created a framework for emergency Medicaid coverage that applies regardless of immigration status and that oversight mechanisms for Medicaid eligibility are already robust. “The indiscriminate sharing of personal health information by the Trump Administration is unnecessary and unlawful,” Neronha said in a press release. The suit casts further suspicion on the data sharing by citing public reports of a broader federal initiative: “It has been widely reported that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been amassing federal benefit data, such as Social Security recipient information, and individuals' tax information, to build a searchable database of Americans' information for several purposes, including to assist ICE in immigration enforcement actions.” Plaintiffs allege that technology firm Palantir has been contracted to build this database and echo a warning from one of its former engineers that “combining all that data, even with the noblest of intentions, significantly increases the risk of misuse.” In signing onto the lawsuit, Neronha joins the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington. They argue that the unauthorized disclosure of Medicaid data not only violates individual privacy rights but also risks a chilling effect on enrollment among immigrant communities, even for services for which they are legally eligible. “States will lose federal funds as fear and confusion stemming from the disclosures cause noncitizens and their family members to disenroll, or refuse to enroll, in emergency Medicaid,” the complaint states. Congress decided to make anyone living in the U.S. eligible for emergency coverage, regardless of immigration status, “to prevent people residing in the United States from dying in the streets while avoiding necessary medical treatment,” Neronha said. By sharing this information with DHS and ICE, the Trump administration is attempting to scare residents away from receiving the federally mandated medical treatment to which they are entitled, according to Neronha. “Further, when people don't seek medical care for infectious disease, we are all put in harm's way,” he said. According to recent data collated by the Kaiser Family Foundation, over 300,000 children and adults are enrolled in Rhode Island Medicaid. The program covers 43 percent of all births in the state, and over one-quarter of Medicaid enrollees are children. The lawsuit seeks declaratory and injunctive relief to halt any further data sharing and to require HHS and DHS to adhere to statutory privacy and data security standards. The plaintiffs emphasize that no System of Records Notice was issued, as required by the Privacy Act, nor was there an opportunity for public comment as required by law."

mov_62D48F104D39BC5ECE4E13D4AEC405AE,2025-07-03 20:12:08,en,WEB,"  An explosion ahead of a Fourth of July celebration at a Cape Cod country club has prompted officials to issue safety warnings around fireworks. Officials say preliminary findings from Wednesday's fireworks explosion at The Club at New Seabury in Mashpee indicate that it was “accidental in nature.” Eight people suffered injuries during the incident. “Two people and one dog were transported for medical care,” the Massachusetts Department of Fire Services said in a statement on Thursday, “and we are deeply relieved that they are all recovering thanks to Mashpee firefighters' immediate on-scene response.” “The display was properly permitted, licensed, and inspected, and all potential factors identified so far are accidental in nature,” the department added. The Mashpee Police Department, on behalf of the Cape Cod Chiefs Association, sent out a safety message, outlining steps for people to take while celebrating the holiday. The first dealt with fireworks. “Fireworks are dangerous and are illegal in Massachusetts,” the message stated. “Possession or use will result in confiscation and may lead to criminal charges. Please leave fireworks to the professionals.” Mashpee Deputy Fire Chief Brenden M. Ramsey stated in a release that multiple explosions occurred during the setup for the annual Fourth of July fireworks display, which was scheduled for 9 p.m. Wednesday. Crew members for the company behind the show, Pyrotecnico, had been assembling the display when it ignited several other cases on the ground, seriously injuring a technician who had to be airlifted to Rhode Island Hospital. Pyrotecnico canceled its holiday display scheduled for Thursday night at another country club in Mashpee. Of the 220 fireworks-related visits to Massachusetts emergency departments from 2020 to 2024, 111 took place during June and July. These months also accounted for 366 of the 559 fires and explosions caused by fireworks during the same five-year period. “Here in Massachusetts, fireworks have caused over 500 fires and explosions, more than 200 emergency department visits, and nearly $1 million in damages over the past five years,” State Fire Marshal Jon Davine said in a statement. “They are illegal without licensing and certification because they are so dangerous. Please don't risk a fire, an injury, or a day in court – leave fireworks to the professionals.” Illegal fireworks account for most of the damage seen in the Bay State, causing 559 fires and explosions, and 220 serious injuries in the past five years. Massachusetts law requires police to seize any illegal fireworks they encounter. This includes fireworks that were purchased lawfully in another state and transported to Massachusetts. People who use or possess them illegally are also subject to a fine, while the unlawful sale of fireworks is an arrestable offense that carries potential jail time. Middlesex County District Attorney Marian Ryan is pushing to strengthen the laws at the State House. A bill she is behind would penalize the reckless use of fireworks or explosive material that causes personal injury or property damage and broadens the sentencing options to correspond to the value of the damage caused. “As we celebrate Independence Day with fireworks & community gatherings, let's not forget that one moment of recklessness can lead to devastating lifelong consequences,” the DA stated in a social media post on Wednesday. “Every year, we see injuries and property damage related to the illegal or unsupervised use of fireworks,” she added. “These events aren't just tragic — they highlight the urgent need to strengthen our fire safety laws.”"

mov_C3D2798522996D984F4EA2D18EE71519,2025-07-03 20:22:02,en,WEB,"  Navy Ensign Kara Sartain has risen in the ranks and in her career through a combination of hard work and sheer determination. In less than five years, she earned a college degree, went from enlisted sailor to naval officer and tackled a new job that was a 180-degree shift from before. Her drive, she said, comes from a desire to excel. “I always feel like I could be doing more, giving more,” she said. “I don't want to ever peak.” Sartain joined the Navy in 2001, seeking to expand her horizons beyond her small hometown of Woodstock, Conn. She walked into the recruiter's office knowing exactly what she wanted to do in the Navy. “I told the recruiter, 'Give me something medical,'” she said. Her father had died of cancer when she was 12, sparking her interest in the career field. “Since I couldn't help my father, my situation, I wanted to help others,” Sartain said. “Plus, there's something selfless about serving others.” Sartain was 17 at the time and still in high school. After a year in the delayed enlistment program, she entered the Navy and served as a corpsman at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., for several years, serving in intensive care units. “I liked the job a lot,” she said. “It seemed to come natural for me. I couldn't get enough.” While working in a cardiac intensive care unit, she was selected to serve on the medical team that cares for the president when he comes to Bethesda. “I felt like I got lucky,” she said. She rose in the ranks to petty officer 3rd class, but felt she had stalled at that point and “wanted something more.” Then one day she saw some midshipmen in “funny” outfits and found out they were cadets in the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Md. “I decided I wanted to go there,” she said. Sartain worked on her application package for more than a year. Her SAT scores resulted in her application being turned down, but she didn't take no for an answer. “I took them over and over, and they were finally high enough,” she said. The Navy first sent her to a prep school in Rhode Island to brush up on her academics. She then attended the academy from 2004 to 2008. “I had to work super hard,” Sartain said. “I was surrounded by super smart kids. I worked weekends and nights, and I passed.” Through it all, Sartain found time to fall in love with an enlisted sailor who also went on to become an officer. They married a week after she graduated from the academy. Unable to gain entry into the academically challenging medical officer career field, Sartain graduated as a surface warfare officer and asked to be stationed on the USS Bainbridge to stay close to her husband. She oversaw a division of 18 sailors who were in charge of boat handling, anchoring and the flight deck. “Here I was, a little blonde girl from Connecticut, in charge of a rowdy group,” she said. “But they were awesome.” She next moved on to become an auxiliaries officer, overseeing a division of seven. “We own all of the auxiliary systems on board -- the air conditioning unit, refrigeration systems, galley equipment – anything with a motor,” she explained. The key to success, she said, is “being flexible. It's a fast-paced mission.” Last year, Sartain participated in the highly publicized rescue of Capt. Richard Phillips after Somali pirates attempted to hijack the ship Maersk Alabama. Always up for new challenges, Sartain said she and her husband would like to be stationed overseas, and she hasn't given up on her quest to enter the medical field. “I'm working on a package to serve in the medical service corps,” she explained, noting that, this time around, she would be serving in administration. “It's all gone by so fast,” she said. “I've been to four or five countries already and work with some awesome people. It sure got me out of my small hometown.” Story by Elaine Wilson, American Forces Press Service Date Taken: 03.29.2010 Date Posted: 07.03.2025 16:22 Story ID:..."

As we celebrate freedom and independence this week, we're thrilled to share some truly historic news for kratom advocacy. Rhode Island's Governor has officially signed the Kratom Consumer Protection Act (KCPA), reversing the state's criminalization law. This marks the first time in U.S. history that a state has reversed a kratom ban — a monumental milestone for the entire kratom community. RI is now the 18th state with KCPA legislation enacted. This victory didn't happen overnight. It's the direct result of years of tireless advocacy, and we at the American Kratom Association are deeply grateful to everyone who contacted legislators, shared their stories, and stood with us. This pivotal moment gives us real momentum to push forward in New England states like Connecticut and Vermont, and strengthens our collective efforts in every state where kratom remains banned. In North Carolina, we're watching legislative developments closely. While the Senate and House are currently deadlocked on a number of issues and we don't expect movement on the Ban or KCPA legislation until late July at the earliest. Rest assured, we'll keep you updated — and we thank all NC advocates for continuing to engage and speak out. Finally, we're excited to announce the launch of our new website this fall: AdvocateStory.org. It's a simple, powerful platform that will showcase testimonials from kratom advocates across the country. The more voices we share from each state, the stronger our message becomes. Please take a moment to visit AdvocateStory.org/share and submit your testimonial today. Your story matters — and it can make a real difference. Thank you for everything you do.

New restrictions on public benefits − including work requirements for food stamps and health insurance − phase in this year and next. And spending cuts feared by state officials in both red and blue states − including reductions in federal Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) − will not take effect until 2028, after the 2026 elections. In debate about the just-enacted $14.3 billion Rhode Island budget, General Assembly leaders said they might be forced to hold a special fall session to respond to any federal cuts or policy changes that would throw state plans out of whack. The delayed effective dates for the Medicaid and SNAP cuts make a special session less likely, but Assembly leaders on July 3 would not rule anything out and said they would need ""a thoughtful review and formal information-sharing on the possible short- and long-term impacts of federal government action."" All four members of Rhode Island's all-Democratic congressional delegation voted against the bill, and the ruling State House triumvirate of governor, speaker and Senate president all opposed the GOP bill. “For many of our neighbors, this budget reduces access to supports like SNAP food assistance. It puts health insurance for thousands of Rhode Islanders in jeopardy, breaking President Trump's empty promise to protect Medicaid,"" Gov. Dan McKee said in a video. House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and Senate President Valarie Lawson said in a joint statement that they would work to pass policies that ""protect access to health care like we did in this year's state budget."" ""We believe it is cruel for Republicans in Washington to pay for large tax breaks for billionaires by stripping Medicaid from vulnerable residents, which will potentially destabilize health care systems at the state level,"" Shekarchi and Lawson's statement said. Rhode Island Republicans, on the other hand, hailed the new budget bill. “This bill delivers exactly what President Trump and Republicans promised, massive tax relief for the middle class, real border security to protect our communities, and deep cuts to reckless Washington spending,"" state GOP Chairman Joe Powers said. ""Democrats in both chambers had the chance to stand with working Americans, and instead, they stood in lockstep with their radical base. Make no mistake – Rhode Islanders won't forget who fought for them, and who sold them out."" The just-passed state budget requires the McKee administration to convene a series of advisory groups to analyze the state impacts of the new federal budget. Separate reports from these groups are due to the legislature by Oct. 31 on potential changes to federal grants, state tax revenue and Medicaid. Provisions in the bill expected to sock the state budget include a reduction in ""State Directed"" payments to hospitals and forced reductions to health care provider taxes that states charge hospitals to leverage additional federal Medicaid dollars. McKee spokeswoman Laura Hart said state agencies ""have been meeting bi-weekly since February to review potential impacts of the various versions of the budget bill"" and are currently identifying people to be on the different working groups required by the Assembly. The budget bill also targets the state's Affordable Care Act-created health benefits exchange by shortening the enrollment period, narrowing subsidy eligibility, and requiring additional paperwork to enroll or renew. Loss of enrollment due to the changes is projected to result in premium increases across health insurance plans on the exchange due to a smaller covered population. ""Simply put, the bill makes health coverage harder to get, more difficult to keep and far too expensive to afford,"" HealthSource RI Director Lindsay Lang said in a news release. ""The effects of the bill will compound each year, likely resulting in significant rate increases for anyone still left in the market."" The Rhode Island congressional delegation weighed in with a range of criticism of the budget bill. Sen. Jack Reed said, ""Republicans structured the bill so the ultra-wealthy can cash out right away while the little guy and average taxpayers will get stuck paying the bill for years to come."" Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said, ""Trump's Big, Beautiful-for-Billionaires Bill"" was ""cooked in back rooms"" and ""saddles our children and grandchildren with trillions and trillions of dollars in debt."" U.S. Rep. Seth Magaziner said the bill ""represents the largest transfer of wealth from working people to the ultra-wealthy in U.S. history."" And U.S. Rep. Gabe Amo said the bill will make Americans ""poorer, sicker, hungrier, and further away from economic opportunity."""
mov_CF4C36CD34B172900F7C2673EEF0EF8B,2025-07-03 22:20:04,en,WEB,"  As Independence Day approaches on Friday, July 4, 2025, Americans nationwide are preparing for celebrations filled with fireworks, barbecues, and a well-deserved day off. But beyond the festivities, many are also wondering about the impact of the holiday on essential services and markets. The stock market, banks, mail delivery, and major retailers will all adjust their schedules in observance of this historic federal holiday. The United States stock markets will be closed entirely on Friday, July 4, in honor of Independence Day, a federal holiday officially recognized since June 28, 1870. This closure applies to both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq, the two primary equity markets. In fact, the holiday break begins a day earlier, as both exchanges will close early at 1 p.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, July 3. This early closure allows traders and investors to start their holiday weekend a little earlier and helps ensure orderly market operations during the shortened trading day. Similarly, the U.S. bond market will follow a coordinated schedule, closing early at 2 p.m. ET on July 3 and remaining closed on July 4. This synchronization across equity and bond markets, as confirmed by the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, maintains consistency in the financial system during the holiday period. Investors should plan accordingly, as no regular market sessions will take place during this extended break. Looking beyond the Fourth of July, the stock market will resume normal trading hours throughout the summer, with the next full market closure scheduled for Labor Day on Monday, September 1, 2025. Later in the year, markets will also close for Thanksgiving on Thursday, November 27, and Christmas Day on Thursday, December 25, rounding out the major federal holiday schedule for 2025. But the market isn't the only sector adjusting for Independence Day. Most banks will be closed on July 4, as the Federal Reserve recognizes the day as a bank holiday. While physical branches will be shuttered, customers can still access ATMs and digital banking services, ensuring some level of financial access during the break. Mail delivery services will also pause on Independence Day. The United States Postal Service will not deliver regular mail or packages on July 4. However, USPS Priority Mail remains operational, ensuring that some critical deliveries continue despite the holiday. Other delivery giants, like FedEx and UPS, will largely suspend their standard services on the Fourth of July as well. FedEx Express will operate with modified service on Thursday, July 3, but most FedEx services will be closed on Friday, July 4. Notably, FedEx Custom Critical will continue operations, catering to urgent shipments. UPS will be closed on the holiday but maintains its UPS Express Critical service for essential deliveries. For those wondering about retail and grocery store hours, the picture is more varied. Many grocery stores will remain open on the Fourth of July, providing essentials for holiday celebrations. For example, Stop & Shop and Market Basket will welcome customers, with Market Basket operating from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Other grocery chains like Dave's Marketplace and Shaws will also be open, though some stores may operate with reduced hours. Trader Joe's plans to close its locations at 5 p.m., and Whole Foods will close its Rhode Island stores at 6 p.m. Costco warehouses, in contrast, will be closed on Independence Day. Major retailers such as Walmart and Target will maintain their regular hours on July 4, ensuring that shoppers can find what they need for the holiday. Fitness enthusiasts will find most Planet Fitness locations open, albeit with limited hours, so they can keep up with their routines even on a holiday. Independence Day itself has deep historical roots dating back to the first anniversary celebrations of American independence in Philadelphia. John Adams famously described the early festivities in a letter to his daughter Abigail, highlighting the spontaneous joy and patriotic spirit of the occasion. Over time, the Fourth of July became an annual tradition, with significant events like groundbreaking ceremonies for the Erie Canal and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad scheduled to coincide with the holiday. It wasn't until 1870 that Congress officially designated Independence Day as a federal holiday, cementing its place in the American calendar. With this year's Fourth of July falling on a Friday, many workers in both the federal government and private sectors will enjoy a paid day off, giving rise to a long weekend filled with relaxation and celebration. The coordinated closures across markets, banks, and services reflect the nation's respect for this historic day while balancing the need to maintain essential operations. As the nation gears up for Independence Day, it's clear that while many services will pause to honor the occasion, others will adapt with modified hours or critical service options. Whether you're planning to watch fireworks, fire up the grill, or simply enjoy a day off, understanding these closures and schedules will help you navigate the holiday with ease. After July 4, business will return to normal on Wall Street and across other sectors, continuing through the summer until the next federal holiday pause on Labor Day. So, mark your calendars, plan your trades, and enjoy the celebrations — the Fourth of July is a time to honor the past and look forward to the future."

While the phone case that included compartments for your lip enhancers was a big hit months ago, this one's missing that cool factor. Although a couple of folks on social media seemed into it, more thought the lip tint looked like a tampon and found the chain tacky. Hailey Bieber posted a set of Instagram photos promoting the new Peptide Lip Tint in Lemontini by Rhode on Wednesday. Two of the images include a Rhode belly chain worn over her bikini. From the chain dangles the lip tint case. Unfortunately for Bieber, it looks a lot like a tampon case, and a bunch of X users noticed.

Undocumented immigrants are ineligible to obtain a Social Security number, which is primarily used to report wages for Social Security benefits. Generally, only noncitizens authorized to work in the United States by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) can obtain an SSN. However, undocumented immigrants who need a number for tax purposes can apply for an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). An ITIN allows those who are not eligible for an SSN to comply with U.S. tax laws and file tax returns. Regarding driver's licenses, 19 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses or permits. These states are: California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Illinois Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota Nevada New Jersey New Mexico New York Oregon Rhode Island Utah Vermont Virginia Washington These states require applicants to provide certain documentation, such as a foreign birth certificate, foreign passport, or consular card, and proof of residency in the state. It's important to note that these licenses may have certain limitations, such as being invalid for federal identification purposes. For example, in Illinois, the standard driver's license issued to those without a Social Security number is marked ""Federal Limits Apply"". In summary, no states give SSN cards to undocumented immigrants. However, several states do offer driver's licenses with varying restrictions. . all this tells me is that you didn't actually read anything."

mov_5AA241773C3A97E0F6670726B71572E9,2025-07-04 00:34:55,en,WEB,"  In her TED Talk “Life's Third Act,” Jane Fonda describes aging not as a time of decline, but as a “staircase–a time for the upward ascension of the human spirit, bringing us into wisdom, wholeness and authenticity.” And yet, many people fear that aging after 60 means a slow loss of independence. But that fear doesn't come exclusively from age itself, much of it is rooted in ageism. Ageism is the persistent message we start hearing early in life, deeply ingrained in a culture that worships youth. These messages are everywhere, and over time, they reinforce the idea that growing older means becoming less relevant, less capable, less worthy. This isn't just about how we treat older adults–it starts much earlier. Young girls and women are bombarded with anti-aging messages long before they've even begun to age, fueled by a multi-billion-dollar industry. The message is clear: aging is a flaw to be corrected. When we equate youth with value, we educate people, especially women, to fear aging, rather than see it as a time of growth, wisdom, strength, and empowerment. The result? By the time we reach our “Third Act,” many of us have internalized the idea that aging is something to resist, hide, or be ashamed of. Ageism erodes our confidence and clarity. It shrinks our possibilities, limits our independence, and hinders the full potential of Act Three. Consider the following: Over half of young women are stressed about aging. A 2023 survey conducted by Allure and The Harris Poll found that 56% of GenZ and 57% of millennial women report being stressed about aging, even while still in their 20s and 30s. Ageism affects most older adults. A study published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society found that over 80% of older adults reported experiencing internalized ageism. These beliefs are linked to poorer physical and mental health, lower self esteem and decreased independence. Rhode Island is not immune to the effects of ageism, or its role as a roadblock to independence for older adults. “Our older neighbors carry around deeply rooted, unconscious social beliefs they've internalized across the years which impact their outlook on aging and lead to negative health outcomes…So, I think it's important for all sectors of Rhode island to join in fighting ageist narratives and create a culture where healthy aging is the priority of all generations,” said James Connell, Executive Director of Age-Friendly Rhode Island. Age-Friendly RI is a leader in changing this narrative. Ageism is an overarching “ism” that needs to be addressed, talked about, and actively dispelled. It affects us all. Everyday ageist messages reinforce harmful stereotypes about aging. Comments like “you look great for your age, she's set in her ways, he's having a senior moment” may seem harmless, but have a cumulative effect that aging is something to overcome rather than embrace. In my work with families across Rhode Island, I have heard from older adults from many walks of life and income levels. Ageism affects us all. I once overheard a 9-year old in Sephora ask her mom to buy a cream that will prevent wrinkles–because she saw it on Instagram. I've heard from a woman who fell and refused to use a walker, even for safety, because she didn't want to appear old. I know men and women who don't leave their homes out of shame, embarrassed to admit they have incontinence issues and are reluctant to buy products that would help them live more independently. We can do better. And better starts with you. We've come a long way in raising awareness about ageism, but we still have far to go. The good news is that each of us can be part of the shift. Each of us can take action. Saying hello to an older neighbor, asking how they're doing, or simply acknowledging their presence and value can go a long way in supporting independence and connection. A culture that sees aging as a strength starts with each of us. And when we do, it brings wisdom, wholeness and authenticity to all of us.

On day one, Trump signed an executive order saying if you're born in the U.S. and neither parent is at least a citizen or permanent resident, you're not automatically a citizen. Twenty-two states immediately sued, saying this violates the Constitution. A federal judge agreed and blocked the order nationwide. Trump didn't appeal whether his citizenship ban is legal - he appealed whether a single federal judge can block his order everywhere while they fight it out in court. The Supreme Court sided with Trump on that narrow procedural question. Here's what this actually means: The Supreme Court didn't end birthright citizenship. They didn't even rule on whether Trump can legally do what he's trying to do. What they said is that if you're born in one of those 22 states that sued, you still get citizenship and all the benefits - birth certificate, Social Security number, Medicaid, food stamps, the works. But if you're born in any of the other 28 states that didn't sue, starting July 27th, you won't get those documents or benefits. You might not even be considered a U.S. citizen at all. Think about how insane this is - your citizenship now depends on which state you happen to be born in. Same Constitution, same parents, completely different outcomes based on geography. The workaround immigrant rights groups are trying is filing class action lawsuits. If you're an undocumented immigrant or here on a student visa and you have a baby after July 27th in one of those non-lawsuit states, you better hope there's a class action suit that covers you and that you're smart enough to know about it and join it. Otherwise, your American-born child might not be considered American. The 22 states that sued are New Jersey, California, Massachusetts, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin, Arizona, Illinois, Oregon, and Washington. This whole mess stems from Trump's interpretation of the 14th Amendment, which says “all persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens.” His administration claims undocumented immigrants aren't really “subject to the jurisdiction” of the U.S., so their kids shouldn't get automatic citizenship. But the Supreme Court already settled this in 1898 when they ruled that Wong Kim Ark, born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was indeed a U.S. citizen because he was born here. Trump is basically asking courts to overturn 125 years of established law. The numbers aren't small either - we're talking about potentially 150,000 babies a year who would lose citizenship under Trump's order. And polling shows only 24% of Americans actually support ending birthright citizenship. What the Supreme Court really did here was strip federal judges of one of their most powerful tools to check presidential overreach. They're saying courts can't issue nationwide injunctions anymore - they can only protect the specific people who sue. It's a massive shift in the balance of power toward the executive branch. Pam Bondi keeps saying the Supreme Court will decide the actual birthright citizenship question in October, but there's no active case on the docket. So here we are - in a country where babies born on American soil might not be American citizens, depending on which invisible state line they crossed on their way out of the womb. And the Supreme Court just made it a lot easier for any president to implement wildly controversial policies while lawyers scramble to catch up. #ratcclips✍️FELON47: CORRUPT INCOMPETENT TREASONOUS"

Col. Ryan Kuhn, deputy commander for 3rd Heavy Brigade Combat Team, said during a conference call. Since Aug. 15, soldiers of Kuhn's “Sledgehammer Brigade” have conducted offensive operations in support of Multinational Corps Iraq's overarching Operation Phantom Strike, targeting militant safe havens and weapons smugglers in Iraq. Troops from 3rd Infantry Division are concentrating on the Madain Qada region along the Diyala and Tigris rivers. The primarily Sunni area, roughly the size of Rhode Island, has been a terrorist safe haven for “quite a while,” Kuhn said. “These operations are putting a toil on the extremist networks that are bringing (weapons) technologies into Iraq, and principally Baghdad,” Kuhn said. “We are not giving the enemy any time to relax or to think of their next (attack).” As U.S. troops help stabilize the area, they also are helping local leaders develop government structure and infrastructure to maintain ground gained against terrorists through provincial reconstruction teams. “PRTs made up of infantry and civil affairs soldiers are working to create an opportunity for economic growth within the area,” he said. Calling it a “grassroots government,” Kuhn said Iraqis in Madain Qada aren't going to wait for a centralized government to get systems into place. “They are acting locally (to make progress).” The emergence of a “concerned citizens” program also is beginning to grow in popularity in the region, he said. “Local leaders are directing their men in towns and villages to take up positions against insurgents.” As a result, Kuhn said, U.S. military leaders are seeing relative stability in the area that most people would not have thought possible several months ago. “We are demonstrating to the residents in Madain Qada that we're here to stand by them and help them stand up for themselves,” Kuhn said. “We're having a strategic effect, and we're making a difference.” Story by Carmen L.

Or when you're obsessed with the quirky monster doll, Labubu, that everyone on social media seems to own? For some, the answer is simple: don't buy it. But for others - especially those stubborn, brand-loving souls - Indian markets have found a workaround. If you can't get the first copy, just buy the fifth one. And no, these aren't dupes with witty name changes or altered packaging. These are full-blown counterfeits: same branding, identical packaging, but at a mere fraction of the price. We took a deep dive into these murky online markets to find out what's being sold, how they are being sold, and more importantly, why so many people are buying them. But before we unpack all that, let's rewind a bit. The Rise Of India's Counterfeit Culture Counterfeit goods aren't new in India. They've existed in various forms for decades. When globalisation opened the floodgates to international brands, a majority of Indians found themselves unable to afford the real thing. The demand was high, but supply (at least the genuine kind) was out of reach. Naturally, the market responded in its own cheeky way. Think of places like D'manoj Pizza knocking off Domino's. Even when Domino's caught wind of the viral video of their doppelganger, their response was just as cheeky: ""Yahan ka address milega? (Can we get the address?)"" (Not a copyright claim) Today, that spirit has spilled across industries, from fast food to fashion to beauty. Markets like Sarojini Nagar in Delhi, Esplanade in Kolkata and Linking Road in Mumbai are prime examples, brimming with off-brand versions of luxury items. These IRL knock-offs often tweak a letter here, a logo there, or at least get the shade of lipstick slightly off. For beauty products though, the compromises run deeper - especially when it comes to ingredients and safety. But the game has changed online. Unlike the local bazaar, where, you know you're buying a knock-off, e-commerce marketplaces and social media are now peddling products that look identical to the original. Meesho, Facebook Marketplace, Amazon, Instagram... everyone is on it, and everyone is in on it. How These Fake Markets Operate Meesho Meesho is notorious (and simultaneously beloved) for offering bargain-basement prices. The brand claims this is possible because it eliminates middlemen, connects resellers directly to manufacturers, and focuses on lesser-known brands. But this has created the perfect breeding ground for fake products - especially viral beauty items. Take Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip treatment, for instance. Not officially available in India, but somehow being sold on Meesho for less than Rs 500. We even found fake Dior and Gisou lip oils, sold in nearly identical packaging but with slightly altered names. Facebook Marketplace It might not be trending in urban Gen Z circles, but Facebook Marketplace (FMP) is still massive. With over a billion global users shopping every month, it's a hotspot for everything from houseplants to handbags - and now, counterfeit beauty products in India. It's not just about fake luxury either. Some sellers offer bizarrely cheap prices for products that shouldn't even be in India, let alone available at that price. The sheer scale of the platform makes it easy for scamsters to thrive with little scrutiny. Instagram Instagram, Meta's glamorous baby, has become a thriving hub for small business sellers, even in India. Unfortunately, many of them are hawking knock-off makeup and skincare products via Reels. Some don't even bother to change the names-they rely on flashy visuals and discounted prices to hook unsuspecting users. The perfume industry is especially saturated with counterfeit sellers offering half-price on these bottles that may look legit but aren't even close.

mov_C1C2D122AEE526FD6746F619342BAABF,2025-07-04 04:30:08,en,WEB,"  The judge who ruled Tuesday to block the Trump administration's reorganization and cost-cutting efforts at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was touted by President Joe Biden for her race and LGBTQ status and has a record suggesting she is unqualified and fixated on racial redress. Judge Melissa DuBose was appointed by Biden in 2024 after being recommended by Democrat Sens. Sheldon Whitehouse (RI) and Jack Reed (RI) and confirmed 51-47 after Republicans Sens. Susan Collins (ME) and Lindsay Graham (SC) voted with Democrats. Whitehouse and Reed's press release announcing the recommendation noted that DuBose “would become the first person of color and first openly LGBTQ judge to serve on the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.” During her confirmation, DuBose stated she was “not aware of any U.S. Supreme Court or First Circuit precedent establishing the legal basis for a nationwide injunction.” While technically not nationwide, her recent preliminary injunction was brought by a coalition of attorneys general from 19 states and the District of Columbia. The record revealed in her confirmation process troubled many Senators. Dubose admitted to having a “Marxist phase” in an 2000 interview with the Feminist Press that she did not provide in her Senate questionnaire. According to that questionnaire, DuBose was a member of the National Consortium for Racial and Ethnic Fairness (2021-2024), where she wrote at least 11 Quarterly Reports for the Committee on Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the Courts, as well as “An Open Letter to the people of Rhode Island.” She also was a member of the Rhode Island Committee on Racial and Ethnic Fairness in the Courts and served as the Public Engagement Committee Chair (2020-2024). According to questions for the record, the committee “mandated a training for all Judiciary personnel, which included a program on 'implicit bias and its effect.'” Dubose participated in a March 2023 panel titled “EmPower Meet Up for Educators of Color” and a January 2023 panel titled “DEI Work in the Courtroom.” Her partisan loyalty was revealed in the hearing as well. During her confirmation hearing, DuBose ended her remarks to Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) by stating “I am a proud Democrat,” later claiming it was “in reference to [her] strong support for our democratic system of government.” DuBose was the first person of color and first openly LGBTQ judge to serve on the Rhode Island District Court, which appears to have been a factor in her latest appointment. Biden highlighted diversity in announcing DuBose's nomination: “These choices also continue to fulfill the President's promise to ensure that the nation's courts reflect the diversity that is one of our greatest assets as a country—both in terms of personal and professional backgrounds.” The Alliance for Justice, which supported her nomination, concurred that diversity was a contributing factor, highlighting that DuBose's nomination was “to Remedy Two All-White Districts.” More from her record and background suggests a hyper focus on racial issues as well as an affinity for alleged criminals. A 2022 profile from Providence College, “Raised off Hope: The story of Judge Melissa DuBose '90”, said that “In addition to hearing cases, DuBose works diligently to achieve just processes and outcomes for all court users. (She prefers “court users” to terms like 'defendant' and 'plaintiff.')” It continued, “She sits on the court's Committee for Racial and Ethnic Fairness, which was born out of the tumultuous and tragic summer of 2020 to identify systemic racism in judicial institutions and processes.” The glowing profile even praised her for exchanging letters with a former student who had committed a gang-related murder. In April 2024, DuBose served as the keynote speaker at the University of Rhode Island's Women of Color Conference. During her investiture ceremony, DuBose stated, “We need to protect the democracy – and we're the last stand.” Dubose's HHS ruling is not her first to attract controversy. In April 2025, DuBose ruled against Republican Maine state lawmaker Rep. Laurel Libby, who sought a preliminary injunction after she was censured for a social media post about a man participating in a women's sport. And in May 2025, DuBose ruled that immigration officials could not deport a Tren de Aragua gang member because he was not given 72 hours' notice. She also dismissed a lawsuit brought by a white couple challenging Rhode Island's marijuana 'social equity provisions' under which they said they were denied a cannabis retail permit. DuBose donated $75 to Democratic Mayor of Providence Angel Taveras in 2014, and $50 to Rhode Island Attorney General Democratic candidate Joseph Fernandez in 2010.

mov_33F74A4799B7578EDD427A9B20CF48D8,2025-07-04 05:23:46,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Venerdì 4 luglio su Tv8 torna Italia's Got Talent (Best of), un'occasione per rivivere i migliori momenti e le esibizioni più belle dei talenti che sono passati sotto la lente di ingrandimento della giuria composta da Mara Maionchi, Elio, Federica Pellegrini e Frank Matano.  Quest'ultimo in particolare, è arrivato al tavolo dei giudici dopo una lunga gavetta e la scoperta su Youtube dei suoi video dove faceva scherzi telefonici.  APPROFONDIMENTI Frank Matano, chi è Francesco Matano, detto Frank Matano, nasce a Santa Maria Capua Vetere, il 14 settembre 1989. Inizia la sua carriera come uno youtuber, e poi diventa anche comico e attore italiano con cittadinanza statunitense. Papà italiano e mamma statunitense, Francesco cresce a Carinola ma dai 15 ai 18 anni vive negli Stati Uniti d'America, dove studia lingue e si diploma alla Cranston High School East, in Rhode Island. Torna, poi, in Italia, a partire dal 2007, all'età di 18 anni, giunge al successo sul web grazie al suo canale YouTube lamentecontorta, costituito principalmente da video di scherzi telefonici, per poi diventare nel 2010 il primo canale YouTube italiano ad aver raggiunto 100 000 iscritti.  A Repubblica racconta: «Da piccolo facevo ridere la mia famiglia, soprattutto mia mamma che a sua volta è molto divertente, la facevo ridere in inglese anche perché se avevamo ospiti io le parlavo in codice... se dovevo parlare male di qualcuno lo facevo in inglese. A 18 anni ho capito che volevo fare questo di mestiere, ma era un segreto perché era un po' ridicolo per me dire che di lavoro volevo far ridere, perché sapevo che ne esistono mille più bravi di te. Dopo i miei ho cominciato a far ridere la mia cerchia di amici e poi sono arrivati i video su YouTube. Ecco con quelli ho cominciato a far ridere un po' più di persone». La carriera   Frank Matano inizia la sua carriera in tv dopo essere stato notato su YouTube, nel 2009 come inviato de Le Iene, con scherzi irriverenti. Nel 2010 conduce per Sky il programma Sky Scherzando? , e partecipa a Ti lascio una canzone di Antonella Clerici.  Nel 2012 collabora con i The Jackal alla web serie Lost in Google e partecipa al programma 2012 Prima di morire.  Spazio anche per il cinema con Fuga di cervelli di Paolo Ruffini e Tutto molto bello. Nel 2015 arriva come giudice a Italia's Got Talent e recita anche in Ma che bella sorpresa con Claudio Bisio e viene premiato come “Personaggio rivelazione dell'anno”.  L'anno successivo conduce Le Iene con Ilary Blasi e nel 2017 affianca Claudio Bisio in The Comedians su Tv8. Nel 2021 vive una nuova rinascita televisiva su Prime Video con LOL - Chi ride è fuori, prima come concorrente e poi come co conduttore insieme a Fedez. Nel 2023 recita in Gigolò per caso, serie comedy  con Christian de Sica e Pietro Sermonti. La vita privata   Frank Matano è fidanzato con Ylenia Azzurretti. Entrambi originari di Caserta, si conoscono grazie ai The Jackal, con i quali la ragazza ha collaborato per il canale YouTube nel 2006.   A Repubblica racconta il loro incontro, mantenendo sempre molta riservatezza: «Lei è di un paese vicino al mio, vicino a Carinola e ci siamo conosciuti tramite comitiva. Ci siamo incontrati al tempo del Covid tramite amici di amici». Gli scherzi telefonici   Il successo di Frank Matano parte di video su Youtube con gli scherzi telefonici. A Fanpage racconta quello più celebre, in cui chiama un'anziana signora facendosi passate per suo nipote: «Nel video ad un certo punto arriva papà che mi diceva: ""È pronto, vieni a mangiare"". Stava per bloccare la mia carriera, quello era uno scherzo che mi stava venendo benissimo. Se si fosse interrotto là sarebbe stata la fine. Era il primo tentativo. Il giorno prima avevo deciso di aprire un canale su YouTube. Ho acceso la telecamera, ho messo a registrare e ho digitato un numero completamente a caso con l'idea di fingermi il nipote. La speranza  era che rispondesse una signora anziana. E così è stato. Magico». Non solo scherzi finiti bene, ma anche qualcuno finito male come quello al papà, la mattina all'alba.  «Facevo degli scherzi a mio padre insieme a mia madre, gli scrivevamo in faccia mentre dormiva. Lui è un carabiniere in pensione. Una volta tornava da un turno di notte, da mezzanotte alle sei. Io, alle sei in punto, mi ero nascosto sotto un tavolo al piano di sotto e martellavo sul pavimento. Quando è entrato in casa, ha tirato fuori la pistola e me l'ha puntata contro. Lì ho capito che non avrei fatto più scherzi del genere. Mi ha detto: ""Tu sì scem prorpj""», ha raccontato  Frank Matano a Fanpage.  Il primo assegno..."

The brown boxes arriving from the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth and Families contain diapers, pacifiers, blankets and powder, not items high on any soldier's hit list. Instead, these items are on their way to the 800th Military Police Brigade's Baghdad Correctional Facility to be given to new and expecting mothers. Lt. Col. Gary Maddocks, brigade civil affairs officer, initiated the project. Maddocks, an Army Reservist from Smithfield, R.I., who works for the Rhode Island department as a child protective investigator. When he came up with the idea, the brigade was caring for five pregnant female detainees at various facilities in Iraq. One mother was so impressed with the professionalism and respect shown to her by a female MP officer that she named her daughter Vivian, born Oct. 28, after the soldier, said Maddocks. ""The idea is to share with children of the world what we are able to give,"" said Maddocks. ""Through children and their families, we may unite someday as one world for one cause of world peace."" He initially contacted his civilian department's director, Jay Lindgren, to see about getting donations of baby supplies to the pregnant mothers, according to Brian Beltrami, another investigator. Lindgren asked Beltrami to get the effort rolling. ""Brian took charge of the agency's effort, sent message out to all four regions and coordinated the entire thing,"" said investigator Jane Lopes, who contributed to the project. The brigade has received several individual donations, and boxes from the group donation are on their way, said Maddocks. ""The response was tremendous,"" wrote Beltrami via e-mail. ""The staff of DCYF are dedicated to helping the children and families of RI on a daily basis. I knew that asking them to donate to moms in a foreign country would be well- received."" When a pregnant Iraqi female is incarcerated and is not a security detainee or high-value detainee, she will go to a hospital in the community to be delivered, according to Lt. Col. Stephen Robinson, brigade surgeon. Procedures call for the mother and baby to be transferred to the Baghdad Correctional Facility after medical release, said Robinson. The mothers then have the option to remain at BCF with their children for up to six weeks, or to turn over care of their children to family members. When the families stay at BCF, mother and child have their own room and are guarded by female corrections guards, said Robinson. These mothers will benefit from the donated items; however, the Rhode Island workers were not just doing the mission for the Iraqi women. ""Not only did we feel we were helping [these mothers], we were also helping our own fellow worker who has answered the call of duty for his country,"" said Beltrami. Meanwhile, the donations have continued to arrive as the brigade continues in its mission of caring for enemy prisoners of war, as well as working with the Coalition Provisional Authority to stand up the new Iraqi Corrections System. DCYF staffers expressed their support not only with the donations, but also with some words of encouragement for the soldiers stationed overseas. ""All of the service men and women are in our thoughts and prayers daily, and we all hope for their safe return home,"" said Beltrami. (Sgt.

Frank Matano, chi è Francesco Matano, detto Frank Matano, nasce a Santa Maria Capua Vetere, il 14 settembre 1989. Inizia la sua carriera come uno youtuber, e poi diventa anche comico e attore italiano con cittadinanza statunitense. Papà italiano e mamma statunitense, Francesco cresce a Carinola ma dai 15 ai 18 anni vive negli Stati Uniti d'America, dove studia lingue e si diploma alla Cranston High School East, in Rhode Island. Torna, poi, in Italia, a partire dal 2007, all'età di 18 anni, giunge al successo sul web grazie al suo canale YouTube lamentecontorta, costituito principalmente da video di scherzi telefonici, per poi diventare nel 2010 il primo canale YouTube italiano ad aver raggiunto 100 000 iscritti. A Repubblica racconta: «Da piccolo facevo ridere la mia famiglia, soprattutto mia mamma che a sua volta è molto divertente, la facevo ridere in inglese anche perché se avevamo ospiti io le parlavo in codice... se dovevo parlare male di qualcuno lo facevo in inglese. A 18 anni ho capito che volevo fare questo di mestiere, ma era un segreto perché era un po' ridicolo per me dire che di lavoro volevo far ridere, perché sapevo che ne esistono mille più bravi di te. Dopo i miei ho cominciato a far ridere la mia cerchia di amici e poi sono arrivati i video su YouTube. Ecco con quelli ho cominciato a far ridere un po' più di persone». La carriera Frank Matano inizia la sua carriera in tv dopo essere stato notato su YouTube, nel 2009 come inviato de Le Iene, con scherzi irriverenti. Nel 2010 conduce per Sky il programma Sky Scherzando? , e partecipa a Ti lascio una canzone di Antonella Clerici. Nel 2012 collabora con i The Jackal alla web serie Lost in Google e partecipa al programma 2012 Prima di morire. Spazio anche per il cinema con Fuga di cervelli di Paolo Ruffini e Tutto molto bello. Nel 2015 arriva come giudice a Italia's Got Talent e recita anche in Ma che bella sorpresa con Claudio Bisio e viene premiato come “Personaggio rivelazione dell'anno”. L'anno successivo conduce Le Iene con Ilary Blasi e nel 2017 affianca Claudio Bisio in The Comedians su Tv8. Nel 2021 vive una nuova rinascita televisiva su Prime Video con LOL - Chi ride è fuori, prima come concorrente e poi come co conduttore insieme a Fedez. Nel 2023 recita in Gigolò per caso, serie comedy con Christian de Sica e Pietro Sermonti. La vita privata Frank Matano è fidanzato con Ylenia Azzurretti. Entrambi originari di Caserta, si conoscono grazie ai The Jackal, con i quali la ragazza ha collaborato per il canale YouTube nel 2006. A Repubblica racconta il loro incontro, mantenendo sempre molta riservatezza: «Lei è di un paese vicino al mio, vicino a Carinola e ci siamo conosciuti tramite comitiva. Ci siamo incontrati al tempo del Covid tramite amici di amici». Gli scherzi telefonici Il successo di Frank Matano parte di video su Youtube con gli scherzi telefonici. A Fanpage racconta quello più celebre, in cui chiama un'anziana signora facendosi passate per suo nipote: «Nel video ad un certo punto arriva papà che mi diceva: ""È pronto, vieni a mangiare "". Stava per bloccare la mia carriera, quello era uno scherzo che mi stava venendo benissimo. Se si fosse interrotto là sarebbe stata la fine. Era il primo tentativo. Il giorno prima avevo deciso di aprire un canale su YouTube. Ho acceso la telecamera, ho messo a registrare e ho digitato un numero completamente a caso con l'idea di fingermi il nipote. La speranza era che rispondesse una signora anziana. E così è stato. Magico». Non solo scherzi finiti bene, ma anche qualcuno finito male come quello al papà, la mattina all'alba. «Facevo degli scherzi a mio padre insieme a mia madre, gli scrivevamo in faccia mentre dormiva. Lui è un carabiniere in pensione. Una volta tornava da un turno di notte, da mezzanotte alle sei. Io, alle sei in punto, mi ero nascosto sotto un tavolo al piano di sotto e martellavo sul pavimento. Quando è entrato in casa, ha tirato fuori la pistola e me l'ha puntata contro. Lì ho capito che non avrei fatto più scherzi del genere. Mi ha detto: ""Tu sì scem prorpj ""», ha raccontato Frank Matano a Fanpage. Il primo assegno..."

mov_31CB19DDB01E0F2EDDBB7C47C6933F4D,2025-07-04 09:02:37,en,WEB,"  Perhaps because his movies rely on surprising plot twists, M. Night Shyamalan has a reputation for being fairly secretive while filming his projects. He has proved no different here in Rhode Island, where he has been filming ""Remain,"" a supernatural romantic thriller in Providence's Cranston Street Armory as well as locations around the state. No doubt, much of his work has flown under the public's radar, but a few filming locations have leaked, giving local residents the thrill of having a movie film in their town and a chance to spy celebrities, including stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Phoebe Dynevor and Ashley Walters. Filming is expected to wrap in August, with Warner Bros. scheduled to release the movie October 23 of next year. Meanwhile, in an unusual arrangement, Shyamalan and New York Times bestselling novelist Nicholas Sparks have joined forces, telling the same original story two ways: as a movie and as book. Both will share credit on each incarnation of ""Remain."" The book version, due out in October this year, is already available for pre-order on Amazon. A synopsis on the bookseller's website says the story centers around New York architect Tate Donovan, who, having just gotten out of a psychiatric facility, is designing a friend's house on Cape Cod. Donovan, who is dealing with the death of his sister, who divulged on her death bed that seeing spirits runs in the family, meets a woman named Wren, who bears secrets of her own. Phoebe Dynevor, known for her role as Daphne Bridgerton in the hit Netflix series ""Bridgerton,"" will be playing a major role in the project alongside Gyllenhaal, according to a Facebook post by Steve Feinberg, executive director of the Rhode Island Film & Television Office. Ashley Walters is also a star in the film. Walters is known for the Netflix series ""Adolescence,"" a British crime drama that's made several 'best TV of 2025 so far' lists. The film will be released just before Halloween next year, on Oct. 23, 2026, by Warner Bros. Gyllenhaal has been seen around Rhode Island as of June 26, as he is currently filming the Shyamalan-helmed film ""Remain,"" including grabbing a coffee at The Nitro Bar in Providence. Shop founder Audrey Finocchiaro posted a TikTok on June 18 with the caption, ""oh and did I mention Jake Gyllenhaal came into @The Nitro Bar today ☕️."" The coffee establishment, which was founded in 2016 as The Nitro Cart, has amassed almost half a million followers on TikTok. It has since expanded to three brick-and-mortar stores – one in Providence and two in Newport. One of the signals that a film crew is in town will be when signs are put up directing cast and crew to locations where they need to be to set up for shooting or actually film. These signs are often several feet across and made of yellow plastic, but other colors and materials may be used. Coffee Depot, June 18 Filming of ""Remain"" began around noon on Wednesday, June 18, inside the Coffee Depot on Main Street, Warren. Background actors walked to and fro on the sidewalk outside the coffee shop, to be seen by cameras filming inside. Prudence Island Ferry, June 18 Cast and crew boarded the Prudence Island Ferry's Herbert C. Bonner for several hours of filming on Narragansett Bay, with possible additional filming after returning to the Bristol dock. Washington Square, June 25 Shyamalan filmed a festive scene with many extras in Eisenhower Park, in front of the Florence K. Murray Judicial Complex. Swamp Meadow Covered Bridge A report in the Valley Breeze said that cars were filmed crossing the bridge the week of June 19. This might fit with a June 23 casting call for amputee actors who would be comfortable with fake blood and portraying being crushed by a bridge. The casting call didn't specify what project was being cast, except to say it was a feature film being shot in Rhode Island, with a shooting day of June 26. Tavern on Main, June 26 The more than two-century-old tavern was the site of several key developments during the 1842 Dorr Rebellion. After the June 26 filming, the restaurant and several employees reported on Facebook that staff members were given roles as extras in the movie. Gray's General Store, Adamsville, June 20 and 23 The more than 200-year-old store, once recognized as the oldest continuously operating store in America, was used for two days of filming. Haffenreffer estate, Sakonnet Point, June 27 Formerly part of the estate of onetime Narragansett Brewery president Carl Haffenreffer, part of Sakonnet Point perched on the Atlantic Ocean was used to film a scene in a meadow. Cranston Street Armory Though it's unclear when filming begins at the armory, it's expected that much of the action will take place on a sound stage set up inside, beyond the prying eyes of the public.

mov_226ABB3A55F2BD47339EE3B71DB0D2CF,2025-07-04 09:41:21,en,WEB,"  Fish science in this country is the best there is. In the case of cod, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration fisheries and the federal agency's science-based approach to fisheries is rallying to rebuild cod, which has been overfished for many years. To make it clear, humans have overfished cod to near extinction, so science alone cannot bring back cod. It will take a lot of regulation discipline, too. In 2021, scientists from around the world got together to study cod and documented five distinct fish populations — an offshore Georges Bank and four inshore populations from New Jersey to Canada. Fish biologist and fishers documented the differences. The five cod stocks look different in that their shape, size and color differ. And their genetic composition, spawning behavior and migration patterns are distinct. Once the stocks were identified, it was now a matter of gathering more data to give fish managers the data needed to put in rebuilding plans. NOAA Fisheries teamed up with members of New England's recreational for-hire (charter boat) fleet, the New England Aquarium, Pelagic Strategies and the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to fill data gaps. The pilot study is called the Recreational Biological Sampling Program, or RecBio. Starting in November 2023, 12 for-hire captains collected data from 3,000 fish, recording length with a photo to verify measurement, kept or released, date and time caught and the precise location. With support from The Nature Conservancy, Harbor Light Software tailored the existing AnglerCatch fishing app as a portal for captains to enter data using a smartphone or tablet. NOAA Fisheries stated: “When a fisherman harvests a cod, the participating captain gives it a unique barcode to match the data submitted to the app. The captain freezes the fish's head at the end of the trip. The science team then extracts the otoliths [ear bones that contain growth rings]. Scientists count the rings of the otolith to estimate the age of the fish. This allows them to understand the demographics of cod caught recreationally.” Congratulations to NOAA and Capt. Rick Bellavance, chairman of the New England Fisheries Management Council, president of the Rhode Island Party and Charter Boat Association and RecBio cofounder and participant for taking a leadership role on this research. The Rhode Island Saltwater Anglers Association and the state Department of Environmental Management once again ran a successful youth fishing camp last week. The camp was held at Rocky Point State Park in Warwick for 55 kids 7 to 12 years old. Camper Teddy Schipritt of Jamestown said: “I haven't caught fish like this before,” as he and other campers hooked up with fish Thursday on about 15 Anglers Association member boats fishing in Narragansett Bay. The expanded Block Island Inshore Fishing Tournament will be held Saturday and Sunday, July 26 and 27. You need not attend the awards ceremony to enter and win. Fish photos are taken up against a tournament ruler and entries are submitted electronically via the GotOne fishing smartphone app. The tournament now includes nine species with an expanded fishing area south of the Newport and Jamestown Bridges, including the Rhode Island southern coastal beaches to about 15 miles south of Block Island itself. Register at BI Inshore Tourney | bi-fishworks (sandypointco.com). Striped bass, bluefish and bonito. Chad Katch of Sam's Bait in Middletown reported: ""The bass have moved out of our Bays and are now out in front from the mouth of the Sakonnet and off Newport. Anglers are hooking up with top water lures in low-light conditions and, during the day, eels, trolling tube and worm and umbrella rigs are working. We also have a good bonito bite at Lands End, Middletown, and at the mouth of the Sakonnet River using epoxy jigs.” Declan O'Donnell of Breachway Bait & Tackle in Charlestown said: “The salt ponds are producing good numbers of school bass in South County, mostly feeding on sand eels. You can catch these fish on top-water lures, soft plastics and Alabama rigs that mimic the bait schools. Bigger fish are taking eels at night.” Jeff Sullivan of Lucky Bait & Tackle in Warren reported: “The striped bass bite at Block Island is lights out at night. Last weekend, we caught fish in the 40-pound class using eels. And, out in front of Newport, 30-pound fish were typical with a lot of large bluefish there, too.” Summer flounder (fluke). “The fluke bite is in both shallow and deep water,"" Sullivan said. "" Anglers who put their time in are catching keeper. "" Chad Katch of Sam's Bait reported: “The fluke bite has been good but it has moved out in font in 70 to 90 feet of water."" O'Donnell said: “Most of the fluke are coming from 37 to 47 feet locally; some larger ones have been caught in 15 to 20 feet of water. The Block Island bite continues to be good.” Freshwater. Ed Lombardo, expert fly-tyer, fisher and instructor, said: ”Fished the Wood River for the Hex Hatch Monday night and the hatch was very good. We got several nice brown trout, which were very aggressive. We started fishing from 6:30 to 10:15 p.m. Now that these fish have been seeing these great large mayflies, one can still fish for them during daylight. But the Hatch will start at dark.” Dave Monti holds a captain's master license and charter fishing license...."

Най-новото ѝ предложение е поредното доказателство: верижка за кръста с прикрепен гланц за устни, която умело размива границите между естетика и функционалност. В серия кадри, публикувани в Instagram и озаглавени ""lemontini ballerini"", Хейли демонстрира новата лимонено жълта линия на Rhode, комбинирайки характерния си ""clean girl"" стил с неочаквана доза провокация – златиста верижка, носена около талията, в която е поставен гланц за устни. Визията е едновременно деликатна и изискана – не просто бижу, не просто козметичен продукт, а хибрид между двете, разположен внимателно върху тялото. Подобна интерпретация на аксесоара извиква спомени за 90-те, за femme fatale естетиката и визуалната игра с функционалност, наблюдавана в творчеството на дизайнери като Том Форд, Версаче и по-късно – Симон Жакемюс. Очаквано, нестандартният дизайн предизвика разнопосочни реакции.

Не масло. И butter yellow вече е изтъркан."" Категорична, тя отново заявява позиция: Rhode не се подчинява на сезонните тенденции.

Long Island's newest steakhouse is a fascinating nod to the Culper spy ring, a local group of Revolutionary War double agents whose heroic espionage efforts saved the colonial forces on multiple occasions. “As we were going through school, we learned about the spy ring and the effect it had on the American Revolution,” Scott Brittman, part owner of Culper's 1778, which opened in Setauket two weeks ago, told The Post. “For the most part, there hasn't been much representation of the spy ring in the area aside from a local tour. I feel like it was a good idea to highlight and honor it.” The new eatery is filled with Revolutionary War-themed decor, including prints of the Battle of Setauket, a print of the Declaration of Independence, a life-size replica musket, and an original US flag, to name a few. Explore More However, Brittman's team truly committed to the theme by tracking down and recreating George Washington's spiced cherry brandy drink of choice, which he often carried, as per the first president's journal. “The Commander,” as it's called, is served infused with lemon and cinnamon and stands among a bevy of Colonial cocktails — like Benedict Arnold's “The Traitor,” made with vodka and, fittingly, tea. There is also the gin-based “Agent 355,” a nod to a female member whose identity is still unknown, in addition to “The Clothesline” Ketel One libation, which pays homage to how Setauket Culper spy Anna Smith Strong sent signals by laying out her laundry in covert patterns. “There's been a lot of people that have come in here from different towns who are big history buffs,” Brittman said, adding that Culper's will be closed on July 4 in observance of Independence Day. Who were the Culpers? Washington's secret agents were a brave band of at least seven known members, according to Christopher Judge, a longtime educator at Oyster Bay's Raynham Hall Museum, which is the former home of Cupler spy Robert Townsend. Setauket native Benjamin Tallmadge led the clandestine group on British-occupied LI alongside his tight-knit allies, Abraham Woodhull and Caleb Brister, circa 1778, the year in which the restaurant is named. “They were all childhood friends, and they knew they could trust each other with their lives. They all agreed to stand against what they considered the tyranny of the British,” said Judge. “You could almost say that they were the CIA of the time — and predecessor to James Bond.” Nearby Port Jefferson native and East Setauket tavern owner Austin Roe, whose great-grandson Justus invented the retractable tape measure, was also a member. The ring's moniker originated from the false surname of Culper that members assumed during their subversive duties, according to Judge, who is stoked to try the steakhouse. Townsend not only played the role of a loyalist to a tee, but also managed to stand sentry and eavesdrop on important Redcoat meetings in a homemade military uniform, Judge explained. “Even George Washington did not know Robert Townsend's true identity, because they knew that if that chain somehow was broken, that it would inflict potential death on the other members,” he said. It wasn't until 1938 that a historian discovered Townsend's involvement after analyzing documents at Raynham Hall. The Culpers' greatest two victories were thwarting a British plot to annihilate the colonial economy by flooding America with counterfeit notes, and also fooling English troops into turning away from where critical French allies were landing in Rhode Island. “The French probably would have been decimated had the British not been given false information by members of the spy ring to divert them back down to New York,” said Judge, who added that their loss would have reshaped the war. “Not a single member of the spy network ever got caught. I would say that was their biggest victory.” Trending Now on NYPost.com This story has been shared 37,581 times. 37,581 Flyer who went viral after refusing to give seat to crying child sues airline, passenger who filmed her This story has been shared 30,385 times. 30,385 Caitlyn Jenner's manager pal, Trump campaign surrogate dead at 29 in Malibu ATV accident This story has been shared 27,231 times. 27,231 Vigilantes deliver street justice to brute who grabbed, attacked woman on NYC subway platform, dramatic video shows This story has been shared 22,379 times. 22,379 Bystander praised for comforting girl who fell off Disney cruise before being saved by hero dad ID'd as ship's head doctor"

The Massachusetts State Fire Marshal's office did not offer an explanation to why the fireworks ignited but said it likely happened during the wiring process. Troopers and firefighters responded to New Seabury Country Club in Mashpee around 4:45 p.m. Wednesday for the reported explosion. One person sustained serious but non-life-threatening injuries and was airlifted to Rhode Island Hospital. A second person sustained minor injuries and was transported to Falmouth Hospital. Another six people were evaluated but refused transport to the hospital, according to officials. Videos sent to Boston 25 News showed a thick cloud of smoke covering the course as the fireworks exploded in rapid succession. A photo provided to Boston 25 News shows a large plume of smoke rising from the golf course. “Fireworks are inherently dangerous, even under controlled conditions and expert use,” the Massachusetts State Fire Marshal's office said. “The Mashpee Fire Department's pre-planning, site determination, permitting requirements, on-scene presence, and immediate action prevented what could have been a catastrophic event with significant property damage, more serious injuries, or much worse.

It was not the generation that fought the war, but rather their descendants who romanctized the war and the Confederacy and fell into the misconception that that had been some sort of moral equivalency, with the war being a tragic spat between brothers. Here is part of a 1910 speech given by a Elisha Hunt Rhodes, veteran from the 2nd Rhode Island Infantry, to comrades in the GAR (Grand Army of the Republic - a veteran's organization for Union veterans): ""We think of the reunited South, and I am not one of those who wants to find fault with what is done in the South. I pity those people. I have seen much of them since the war. I remember standing one day looking at a monument in Athens, Georgia, when a young collegian said to me, “I suppose you object to this monument being here.” **“Oh no, I said, “if you people want to perpetuate your shame, I care little about it. You are simply telling the story to your children of how you tried to pull down the old flag and how you failed.” ** Another day I stood by the monument in Winchester, Virginia, and I read upon it an inscription which told how men had died for liberty, had died for constitution in the country. An old gentlemen asked me what I thought of it. **“Oh,” I said, “The day will come when you will put a ladder up against that monument, and you will hire a colored man who once wore the shackles to climb that ladder and efface every word of that inscription, for it is false. There is no truth in it.” ** **Those men were brave men, and I am willing to pay tribute to their bravery; but they did not die for liberty, they did not die for their constitution, they did not die for their country. ** Two, or three, or four, or five years afterward I stood in the same place, and a Confederate soldier whom I was visiting said to me, “Do you remember what you said to that old gentlemen about that inscription?” I said, “Yes.” He said, “Look at it now.” I said, “Yes, nature has been kind to you,” for the moss had grown over it so that it could not be read. It had been completely effaced."""

Specifically, California, New York, Illinois, Washington, New Jersey, Oregon, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Colorado, Connecticut, Utah, Rhode Island, Maine, and Vermont, as well as Washington D.C. Some states like New Jersey and Vermont also extend state-funded coverage to pregnant individuals regardless of immigration. It saves those states health systems basically. Most blue states pay far more into the federal system than the red states do. The red states generally have more poverty and disproportionately benefit. As far as Social Security goes, working undocumented workers pay in ( agriculture, hospitality, etc) to SSI, but they are never paid Social Secuity benefits. They only have a SSI number so they can pay in. Green card holders may qualify for SSI if they meet a 5 year residency requirement and if they meet certain other criteria. They pay in too. Immigrants pay in more SSI than they take out. So this benefits US citizens. I delighted to hear you are in favor of helping to support the less fortunate. That's important, and I do think blameless non-citizen children deserve help. They are victims. It's really crucial to be careful and not throw babies out with bath water. P.s. I'm not your sweetheart, that is disrespectful and inappropriate and part of why a reasonable discourse of different views becomes so problematic."

(WLNE) — John Perrotta's life has been anything but ordinary – chaotic, honest, and wildly unpredictable. In his memoir, “How Comedy Saved My Life,” the Cranston resident pulls back the curtain on the pain behind the punchlines. “I always felt I had a different unique life. My life was different. I know there were people you know some people crazy than others but I know mine was at least in the middle of the pack crazy wise,” said Perrotta. “I knew I knew I had a lot of stuff that I could tell in a book and it's all there. The stories in it all true these stories are crazy a lot of them they really happened and there's nothing made up all true stuff.” From wild stories to raw personal struggle, John opens up about the years he spent battling addiction, times when he didn't think he'd make it out. “I remember so many bottoms I hit with the addictions I had and I remember thinking there was no way out in my story,” said Perrotta. “(It) is one of hope that there is a way out no matter how far down you go you can seek help and talk to others and find your way out of whatever you're in.” What pulled him out wasn't just treatment or time. It was something deeper. Something that lit a fire again: comedy. “I found comedy that's what became my saving grace and I think if you have addictions and you hit the bottom like I hit many many bottoms and there's people out there with different addictions that may be at that same point,” said Perrotta. “…I had the passion for comedy and and that kept me going.” His message is clear – no matter how far you fall, there is a way back. His story isn't just about getting laughs. It's about getting up. Categories: Cranston, News, Rhode Island"

It varies by state, but it would be the state the accident occurs in, not the state the owner is in. *Several states have laws or legal doctrines that can hold registered owners liable for the negligent actions of people they allow to drive their cars. Here's a list of some of them, based on the information gathered:* * ***California:*** *Operates under a ""permissive use"" law where vehicle owners are generally liable for death, injury, or property damage resulting from the negligent operation of their vehicle by someone they have given express or implied permission to drive. * * ***New York:*** *Has a ""permissive use"" law that makes vehicle owners financially responsible if they allow someone else to drive their car and that person causes an accident due to negligence. * * ***Florida:*** *Has a broad vicarious liability law that generally holds vehicle owners liable for the negligent actions of anyone driving their car with their consent, regardless of the relationship between the owner and the driver. This is a particularly strong form of owner liability. * * ***Michigan:*** *Holds vehicle owners responsible for injuries resulting from the negligent operation of their vehicle by a driver with the owner's explicit or implied permission or awareness, especially if the driver is a spouse, parent, sibling, or child. * * ***Georgia:*** *Utilizes the ""Family Purpose Doctrine,"" which can hold a vehicle owner financially liable for damages caused by a family member driving the vehicle, even if the owner was not present. * * ***Connecticut:*** *Has a statute that can hold the owner liable for the negligence of anyone operating the vehicle with the owner's permission. * * ***Rhode Island:*** *Has a law that makes the owner liable for the negligence of a driver operating the vehicle with their consent. * * ***Maryland:*** *Has a statute that can impute the driver's negligence to the vehicle owner under certain circumstances, especially if a family member is driving. *"
mov_0945FE72907F550AB2E9A5F0347EF0D6,2025-07-04 17:55:05,en,WEB,"  Image Courtesy of Anna Droddy By KEN KRANTZ July 4, 2025 Ophelia is a New York–based multidisciplinary artist who recently graduated with her MFA in sculpture from Rhode Island School of Design (RISD). Her body of work is a haunting world of biomorphic crochet sculptures, and she is working diligntly in preparation for her first post-graduation solo show at Lyles & King: The Natal Lacuna. This title was chosen in reference to Luce Irigaray's eponymous philosophical feminist text about Unica Zürn, a German artist known for her work focused on surrealism, mental health, and anagrams. “Your brain becomes a filter with a patina of everything you've encountered in your life. It'll never look like anyone else's (or even yourself a year from now),"" explains Ophelia, surrounded by the notes and studies pinned across her studio. Using yarn, tulle, and found objects, Ophelia Arc crafts visceral, flesh‑toned sculptures that balance delicacy and disquiet. The hanging forms evoke the raw physicality of a meat locker sifted through a filter of feminist introspection and material sensitivity. Ophelia treats crochet as a potent tool of self‑inquiry, confronting viewers with uncomfortable truths about memory, the body, and the psychology of wound‑dwelling. In simpler terms, this means that Ophelia uses crochet as a powerful way to explore difficult emotions and personal pain. Her work brings up raw, sometimes uncomfortable feelings about things like memory, the body, and how people can get stuck in their own hurt. Ophelia is incredibly brilliant. The exceptional level of recognition she has achieved prior to completing her formal education feels inevitable when considered within the larger framework of her rigorous practice. For Ophelia, making is never paused…it is a state of being. She crochets in transit, in conversation, even with her eyes closed. Her practice is ceaseless and embodied. Image Courtesy of Anna Droddy Ophelia's clarity of focus is rooted not just in ambition, but in deeply personal moments that shaped both her worldview and her artistic intentions. “I was hospitalized as a kid, at ages 11 and 14. I remember how shitty the art was,” she recalls. “Seeing those photos was a tether to the real world. I became interested in art pieces placed in a non-art context as a bridge to reality, interested in transitional object theory and how something on the inside and outside of the real world could assimilate into real life… My long term goal is institutional acquisition in mental institutions, and I noticed that the people who did that had certain criteria.” And thus, she went down the path to art school, despite the significant financial commitment. “By all accounts, I'm fucked. I'm still in debt,” she says, then pivots. “But I'm still lucky in many ways. The certain way I'm obsessive works in this world. This is my whole being… I'm giving it everything.” Image Courtesy of Anna Droddy Ophelia first gained momentum during her BFA at Hunter College. The strength of Ophelia's senior thesis there set her apart early on, signaling a level of sophistication and vision rarely seen at the undergraduate level. At that time, she was scouted by the Whitney Museum's Nakai Falcón, who still loves her work: ""I can confidently say that the relentless care and intentionality Ophelia dedicates to the refinement of her practice is unmatched. Carrying out the traditions established as early as the 1960s by her predecessors that prioritized the disruption of textile's presence within creative culture and voicing feminist perspectives, Ophelia's lens vitally contributes to the position of fiber art as a catalyst for psychoanalysis in relational systems and investigating familial structures of upbringing. Home as place and tied to the self felt important for us framing Ophelia's solo debut back in 2024; referencing this formative place, but not excluding formative experiences outside of the home. Having observed the progress since then in anticipation of her upcoming solo exhibition in June, the work has developed in a complexity that appears to more actively situate the viewer into familial settings of world building, while continuing to give the artist's research more tangible forms. I'm eager to see how Ophelia furthers these site-related conversations that will more closely examine institutional interventions and the body's agency."" By the end of her MFA, Ophelia had two stellar solo exhibitions under her belt: ﻿The Aesthetics of Decay (curated by Eric Shiner for Spring Break Art Show) and we're just so glad you're home (curated by Nakai Falcón for 81 Leonard Gallery). Instagram also played a pivotal role in amplifying Ophelia's early visibility. Her uncanny sculptures quickly caught the attention of curators, collectors, and aspiring artists who discovered her work online before ever encountering it in a gallery. “I'll have kids DM me, 'I'm doing a project for school, can I interview you?' I'll hop on a Zoom with them in a different state or a different country. I love doing it,” she says. “They see me and know they can reach out, because I'm a person.” Through consistent documentation, poetic captions, and glimpses into her making process, Ophelia built a digital presence that mirrored the emotional depth and material intimacy of her physical works. “My art is not a coveted, secretive thing,” Ophelia explains. “It's a behavior or a process through which I understand my world.” “When my work started selling, I was surprised,” she explains. “I put the money in a HYSA, and that's what's funding my studio for the year...."

Watch: ""Macy's Fourth of July Fireworks Spectacular"": What to Know! These celebrities traded in their usual glamour for red, white, and blue. After all, stars like Khloe Kardashian and Meghan Markle rang in the Fourth of July in their own unique style, ranging from family filled activities to creating the perfect hors d'oeuvres. Indeed, Khloe celebrated Independence Day in true patriotic style alongside her and ex Tristan Thompson's kids True Thompson, 7, and Tatum Thompson, 2, as well as niece Dream, 8, who is daughter to Rob Kardashian and his ex Blac Chyna. The Good American founder shared a glimpse of the Kardashian kids enjoying a backyard party on her Instagram Story, complete with snacks ranging from ice cream to doughnuts, as well as a neighborhood parade. And of course, True, Tatum and Dream were decked out in their best red, white and blue outfits—sporting matching American flag ensembles. For Meghan's part, she shared how to put together the perfect Fourth of July spread with the help of her As Ever jam. The Duchess of Sussex—who shares kids Archie, 6, and Lilibet, 3, with Prince Harry—shared a video July 4 putting together a spread with bread, raspberries and strawberries. Meanwhile, Olivia Culpo gave a glimpse of her growing baby bump after she and husband Christian McCaffrey announced in March they are expecting their first baby together. Alongside a photo of her tummy in a blue and white pinstriped dress, Olivia wrote in an Instagram Story, ""Ready to celebrate you, America."" Of course, in addition to cookouts and family time, for years the holiday has been a staple for Taylor Swift. Indeed, the 35-year-old earned a reputation for throwing the most extravagant star-studded Fourth of July bashes at her Rhode Island mansion, which has featured the likes of Gigi Hadid, the HAIM sisters, and best friend Selena Gomez. And while the “So High School” singer played host, she also took on the role of matchmaker for longtime friend Ed Sheeran whose first date with now wife Cherry Seaborn was on the beach outside Taylor's house. “I went to Taylor's Fourth of July party,” he told in 2017. “I was texting [Seaborn], and she was like 'I'm in Rhode Island at a Fourth of July party' and I was like, 'So am I.' I kinda said to Taylor, 'Can I invite one of my old schoolmates?' The rest is history.” But while some stars are living up to Taylor-level celebrations this year, not everybody took time away from work this weekend. The Jonas Brothers are at the forefront of the action, set to perform at the The Rooftop at Pier 17 in Manhattan, followed by the iconic Macy's Fireworks show. Ava Max, Lenny Kravitz and Keke Palmer are among those joining in on the action while Oscar winner Ariana DeBose hosts the show, which is set to air live on NBC at 8 p.m. ET. Trisha Yearwood—who is married to country music star Garth Brooks—is also set to return to the stage. And for her it's a monumental moment as she admitted to  ahead of the festivities that she doesn't usually perform at Independence Day celebrations anymore “unless it's something really big like this.” Keep reading for how more stars celebrated their Fourth of July weekend.

mov_A7FB570FFB6CC362B44BC609805B6493,2025-07-04 20:39:32,en,WEB,"  PARIS. - David Zwirner is presenting new work by Huma Bhabha at the gallery's Paris location. Distant Star features six sculptures and a series of large-scale drawings, presenting new directions and materials that expand the scope of the artist's practice. The exhibition coincides with a two-person presentation of Bhabha's work in dialogue with sculptures by Alberto Giacometti, on view at the Barbican Centre in London until August 2025. Own a Piece of Contemporary Art! Find richly illustrated books that capture the raw, powerful essence of Huma Bhabha's work. Find your next art book on Amazon! A solitary beacon in the gallery's front room is the titular cast-iron sculpture Distant Star (2025), which stands tall like a mysterious sentinel. The sculpture appears to be eternally watching and waiting, suspended in a state of petrified solemnity. Its living rust-orange surface will continue to oxidize and evolve in appearance, affirming the notion of time as a primordial sculptor's tool—a concept that Bhabha has repeatedly returned to in her oeuvre. Value our daily art insights? Consider a gift to ArtDaily! Find us on PayPal or become a patron on Patreon. In the main gallery are five sculptures made using Bhabha's characteristic arsenal of multivalent techniques; she begins with cork, which she then carves, gouges, paints over, and otherwise marks up. Notably, these works also introduce new formal elements and sculptural processes: to create these sculptures, the artist rubs wet clay atop areas of these previously carved surfaces, adding an additional layer of coloristic and textural dimensionality. In the works on view, passages of material are juxtaposed with densely carved areas that delineate limbs or scarred flesh, resulting in forms that are embodied in a state of disorder, erosion, and entropy. They appear to be emerging from—or encased in—rubble and debris. Some works possess skeletal heads fashioned from salvaged animal skulls, clay, chicken wire, Styrofoam, and cork. These sculptures stand on black wooden plinths, further lending them the feeling of a mortal relic or an artifact from another world. Surrounding the sculptures, Bhabha presents a group of ink-and-collage drawings made atop photographs she has taken. Each of these large-scale works depicts a single hooded portrait—a new motif in the artist's visual repertory that draws a connection between thirteenth- and fourteenth-century depictions of saints and Franciscan monks by artists such as Cimabue, Giotto, and Margaritone d'Arezzo and the ubiquitous symbol of the modern-day hoodie. Their facial features are omitted, save for black-rimmed, collaged eyes that gaze out at the viewer with a direct stare, relaying a sense of their varied endurance; with eeriness, foreboding, and humor, they bridge the divide between what is monstrous, animal, alien, and deeply human. Distant Star is the gallery's third exhibition of Bhabha's work since the announcement of her representation in 2022, and it follows her two concurrent solo shows held at the gallery's 537 West 20th Street and 34 East 69th Street locations in New York in February and March 2024. This is the artist's first solo presentation in Paris since 2009. Huma Bhabha (b. 1962) was born in Karachi, Pakistan, and moved to the United States in 1981 to attend the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, from which she received her BFA in 1985. She received her MFA from the School of the Arts at Columbia University, New York, in 1989. The artist presently lives and works in Poughkeepsie, New York. From May through August 2025, Bhabha's work is featured in Encounters: Giacometti at the Barbican Centre in London. Co-curated by Shanay Jhaveri and Émilie Bouvard, and co-organized by the Barbican and the Fondation Giacometti, this presentation shows works by Bhabha alongside sculptures by Alberto Giacometti. Bhabha's presentation is the first of three rotating shows at the Barbican, each with a different contemporary artist showing their work in dialogue with Giacometti's oeuvre. In 2024, Huma Bhabha: Before The End, a large-scale installation commissioned by Public Art Fund, was unveiled at Brooklyn Bridge Park, New York. In 2023, M Leuven, Belgium, presented the solo exhibition Huma Bhabha: LIVIN' THINGS. The show traveled to MO.CO., Montpellier, France, in November 2023 as Huma Bhabha: A fly appeared, and disappeared. A solo presentation of Bhabha's work curated by Nicholas Baume was on view at Fundación Casa Wabi, Puerto Escondido, Mexico, from 2022 to 2023. In 2020, the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead, England, presented Huma Bhabha: Against Time. The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, organized Huma Bhabha: They Live, on view in 2019, and published an accompanying catalogue. An installation of the artist's work, Huma Bhabha: We Come in Peace, was commissioned by The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, in 2018 for the museum's Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden. Previous solo exhibitions of the artist's work have taken place at prominent institutions such as The Contemporary Austin, Texas (2018); MoMA PS1, New York (2012); Collezione Maramotti, Reggio Emilia, Italy (2012); Aspen Art Museum, Colorado (2011); and The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, Connecticut (2008), among others. Bhabha's work has also been included in numerous group exhibitions internationally, including MANZAR: Art and Architecture from Pakistan 1940s to Today, National Museum of Qatar, Doha (2024); The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, DC (2024); Summer Exhibition 2023, Royal Academy of Art, London (2023); Reclaim the Earth, Palais de Tokyo, Paris (2022); Traces, Portland Art Museum, Oregon (2022); Hi Woman (curated by Francesco Bonami), Museo di Palazzo Pretorio, Prato, Italy (2021); NIRIN, 22nd Biennale of Sydney (2020); 2019 Yorkshire Sculpture International, Wakefield, England; All the World's Futures, 56th Venice Biennale (2015); and the 2010 Whitney Biennial. Bhabha has been the recipient of notable awards, such as the Guna S. Mundheim Fellowship, Berlin Prize, awarded by The American Academy in Berlin (2013); and the Emerging Artist Award, awarded by The Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum, Ridgefield, Connecticut (2008). In 2022, Bhabha was elected as a National Academician by the The National Academy of Design, New York. In 2023, the artist was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters, New York. Work by the artist is held in significant collections worldwide, including the Art Gallery of New South Wales, Sydney; Buffalo AKG Art Museum, New York; The Bronx Museum of the Arts, New York; Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; Centre Pompidou, Paris; Collezione Maramotti, Reggio Emilia, Italy; Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center, Vassar College, Poughkeepsie, New York; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC; Long Museum, Shanghai; Los Angeles County Museum of Art; The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Museum of Art, University of New Hampshire, Durham; Museum of Fine Arts, Houston; The Museum of Modern Art, New York; Museum of Old and New Art, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia; National Gallery of Australia, Canberra; Nerman Museum of Contemporary Art, Overland Park, Kansas; New York Public Library; RISD Museum, Providence, Rhode Island; Roberts Institute of Art, London; Sharjah Art Foundation, United Arab Emirates; Sheldon Museum of Art, University of Nebraska, Lincoln; Tate, United Kingdom; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Connecticut; and Zhuzhong Art Museum, Beijing, among..."

mov_EF6D7F4790D222EF748EEC04679E7CA7,2025-07-04 21:47:02,en,WEB,"  After reports of multiple blazes on the Alaskan landscape, Connecticut delivered 18 firefighters to help wildfire suppression efforts in the largest U.S. state. ALASKA, USA — Multiple wildfires are spreading across parts of Interior Alaska. In response, the country's largest state is assembling resources to that region to suppress the flames and minimize the damage. As firefighters and hotshot crews in Alaska do their best to quell the fires, they're battling more than the blaze. Currently, the elements are stacked against them as well. Warm temperatures, dry and flammable materials on the ground and an increased amount of lighting due to Alaska's current weather pattern are challenging responders, as new fires emerge. To prevent the fires from growing in severity, Alaska needs help, and Connecticut is among the states answering the call. RELATED: Connecticut Interstate Fire Crew returns from deployment in Washington, Oregon On Thursday, the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, or DEEP, announced that its Forestry Division coordinated the mobilization of a 20-person wildlife firefighting crew to help the ongoing wildfire suppression efforts in Alaska. DEEP officials say the deployment was organized in coordination with the Northeastern Forest Fire Protection Compact and Northeast Coordination Center. The team includes 18 members from the Connecticut Interstate Fire Crew, or CIFC, and two members from the Rhode Island Department of Emergency Management. The crew left DEEP's Eastern District Headquarters in Marlborough on Thursday to embark on an approximately 5,000-mile journey. The deployment is the first assignment for CIFC members this wildfire season. Sign up for the FOX61 newsletters: Morning Forecast, Morning Headlines, Evening Headlines Seven members of the crew are full-time DEEP staff, and other members include trained “call-when-needed” wildland firefighters who are certified to national wildland firefighting standards. All members of the crew volunteer for the assignments and are trained in wildlife suppression tactics, safety and incident command. CIFC is managed by DEEP's Forestry Division. The division has at its disposal a long roster of agency staff members and private individuals. Many of them are associated with local fire departments and have been certified to fight forest or wildfires. Before being deployed, crew members must complete a difficult training program, pass annual physical work capacity tests and undergo rigorous refresher training. Connecticut is able to contribute to subduing the Alaskan fires through its participation in a reciprocal aid program operated by the U.S. Forest Service. RELATED: 19 members of the Connecticut Interstate Fire Crew deployed to fight Oregon wildfires This program enables trained firefighting personnel from across the nation to assist Connecticut in the event of a fire emergency or natural disaster in return for the support of Connecticut professionals when other states need it. Locally, this trade-off proved invaluable in 2024. Last fall, Connecticut experienced weeks without rain, and a significant and prolonged blaze known as the Hawthorne Fire broke out on Lamentation Mountain in Berlin. Tragically, one first firefighter – Robert Sharkevich Sr., from Wethersfield – lost his life in the process of battling the fire. In response, during that multi-week event, firefighters arrived in Connecticut from states throughout the country and even from Quebec, Canada to help in Berlin as well as other locations locally that were experiencing wildfires. DEEP officials say that all state agency expenses associated with the deployments are entirely reimbursed to the state by the U.S. Forest Service.

This comes after Flutterwave secured 20 additional MTLs in the U.S., adding to the 14 licenses the brand has held since 2023. Altogether, this achievement raises Flutterwave's total number of direct licenses to 34, allowing the company to operate across many U.S. states and territories without partners or intermediaries. Users in the U.S. can now send money to Nigeria, Ghana and Egypt, unlocking new remittance corridors that were previously unavailable. Alongside this expansion, the onboarding process has been streamlined with a quick ID check, making it faster and easier for new users to get started. Additional improvements include optimised payment support for US-issued Visa and Discover cards, enhanced security measures to safeguard transactions and maintain compliance, and improved in-app flows for a simpler, more efficient sending experience. This return also highlights Flutterwave's commitment to delivering a seamless, secure, and regulatory-compliant user experience for all Send App customers in the U.S. Users can now send money from DC, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Michigan, South Carolina, Tennessee. Other U.S. states and territories where Send App by Flutterwave supports outward remittances include Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Maine, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Oregon, Puerto Rico, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Commenting on the relaunch, Olugbenga “GB” Agboola, Flutterwave Founder and CEO, said, “By expanding our reach and enhancing our services, we are empowering millions of Africans in the U.S. to maintain strong financial ties with their home countries, support their families, and contribute to economic development across the continent. Additionally, we are staying true to our core mission of bridging Africa with the global economy and vice versa.” Earlier this year, Flutterwave integrated Swap into Send App for seamless FX transactions and strengthened its services in Ghana by securing approval for inward remittance from the Bank of Ghana.

The 59-year-old actor has heaped praise on model Hailey, 28, after she sold off her Rhode beauty brand for the massive sum. Speaking on The Adam Corolla Show podcast, he said: ""The cool part of it is she's super smart, smart in business. ""Succeeded as a model prior to everything she's doing now. But the cool part was she actually had an offer to do something pretty big and cool in the cosmetics a couple years ago and didn't. ""The reason it's succeeding is people are responding to it. It actually works as hydration and all of that."" Stephen - who is also father to actress Alaia, 32, - added that he has ""remained the same"" throught the success of his children and insisted that they can always rely on him to be honest with them. He said: ""The sweet part of my kids, too, is, in the wake of whatever their success is, their dad remains the same. I've always been the same way. You know you're going to tell your daughter the truth."" Hailey - who is married to pop star Justin Bieber and has 11-month-old son Jack Blues with him - sold her company to e.l.f. Beauty in a deal estimated to be worth up to $1 billion, but she'll stay on as chief creative officer and head of innovation as well as acting as a consultant to e.l.f. Beauty - and Hailey is adamant the arrangement will help her take the products to a whole new level and expand across the world. She told Glamour magazine: ""When you're launching a brand, you're just so focused on what's right in front of you at the time. ""And of course, you always have really big dreams and really big goals for it. This is definitely one of those things being realised. I could have never anticipated that it would happen at this exact time ... ""I'm super excited ... I'll be the chief creative officer and head of innovation at Rhode and advisor to Elf Beauty.

L., 118) created a special service known as the Bureau of Navigation, under the Treasury Department, with the duty of supervising the work having to do with the administration of American navigation laws. ""The act specifically allotted to the bureau the numbering of vessels and the preparation of the annual list of merchant vessels of the United States."" 1996  The Coast Guard commissioned CGC Juniper (WLB 201) on this date in 1996. The new 225-foot WLB was the lead ship in the Coast Guard's Buoy Tender Replacement Project, a major acquisition to replace the service's twenty-six 180-foot buoy tenders constructed during World War II. A total of sixteen 225-foot WLBs were built by Marinette Marine Corporation for the Coast Guard. Juniper was assigned to its homeport of Newport, Rhode Island. 2000  HH-65A CGNR 6539 rescued 51 persons from a burning oil rig in the Gulf of Mexico. The aircrew responded to the fire and safely airlifted 15 people to a nearby platform nine miles from the fire. They then evacuated another 36 people to awaiting boats. One of the 6539's crew, AST1 John Green, had landed on the platform to coordinate the rescue. As the helicopter returned to retrieve him, the rig exploded and sent a fireball 100 feet into the air. Unsure whether he survived, the 6539 flew into the thick, black column of smoke and safely rescued him. All four aircrew were awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. (read the linked story, it is fantastic--Chuck)   Their accomplishments were entered into the Congressional Record by Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu. The closing paragraph of her tribute is as follows:   ""Today people say we live in a world without heroes, one in which cynicism and selfishness rule the day. I am proud to say this is not the case in our United States Coast Guard. Guardsmen and Guardswomen like Lieutenant Commander Moore, Lieutenant Beshears, Petty Officer Bouchard and Petty Officer Green put their lives on the line every day so that others may live. In this case, 51 men owe their lives to these four heroes who lived up to the Coast Guard's motto of “Semper Paratus–Always Prepared.” On behalf of those 51 men, their families, the state of Louisiana and Americans everywhere, I am proud to stand here today and say “Thank you–job well done!” to these extraordinary heroes."""

From one end to another, the process spans a hybrid of robotic and human efforts. Automated machines deftly move products around the floor, while people pack bins and boxes, among other things. And while the $400 million facility first opened the doors to its now more than 1,500 full-time workers in October, site leader Sultan Kabiawu said the operation had reached what he considered ""a new maturity point"" by Tuesday morning. ""We've grown to a point where we're able to serve the demand that we would like to serve in the local area,"" Kabiawu said. So set the backdrop of Tuesday's official ribbon cutting for the center — the end of a years-long effort to get the online retailer up and running off of Route 6, about eight miles west of downtown Providence. The location is prime for Amazon: Kabiawu said the site allowed the company to reduce the time it takes to get orders to customers, the latest piece in the retailer's regionalization strategy. The facility holds approximately 41 million items spanning the consumer spectrum, from toys and books to electronics and ""everyday essentials,"" he said. But local and state officials on hand Tuesday were also quick to point out a few other numbers. Thanks to a tax deal hammered out in 2021, the facility is expected to generate an average of $7.2 million a year in property taxes, or approximately $144 million over the next two decades. Amazon said, among other investments, it also pledged another $19 million for ""local priorities, including education, public safety, youth sports, senior center, and municipal land trust."" The project is ""the essence of what we do here in Johnston,"" Mayor Joseph Polisena Jr. said Tuesday. The town of nearly 30,000 people plays host to a variety of major corporations. FM Global, the insurance company, is headquartered here. Citizens Bank boasts a 123-acre campus in town, too. ""Here in Johnston, we have fully embraced our local, regional, and national transformation into a service economy,"" Polisena said. ""The premise we follow here is simple: The more commercial tax revenue you generate, the less you need to ask from your residents. That formula has worked for us, and it's honestly one that can work anywhere."" Brad Griggs, who leads economic development for Amazon in New England, the mid-Atlantic region, and Canada, said the company is ""proud to call Rhode Island home."" The facility picks, packs, and prepares packages for transport to sorting and logistics facilities across the Northeast, he said. Construction on the center began in 2022, and according to Kabiawu, the facility is now fully staffed. Wages start at $20.50 per hour. Governor Dan McKee said Amazon has been ""a great partner"" for the state. ""They're helping us with our small business transition into this world of [online] retail,"" McKee said. More than 60 percent of Amazon sales are from independent sellers, most of them small- and medium-size businesses, according to the company. In Rhode Island, those sellers averaged more than $160,000 in annual sales and sold more than 4 million items last year, Amazon said. Among the local sellers is John Speights, owner of Cooper's Cask Coffee, based in East Greenwich. Speights, who previously had a 20-year career in tech, officially launched the business in 2015, after he began roasting coffee in a garage for fun, he said. These days, the business has a small staff: two full-time employees and five part-time workers during the holiday season, he said. ""Amazon has been huge for us. It's enabled us to scale without having to invest in infrastructure,"" Speights said in an interview on Tuesday. ""During the holiday season, we'll sell 20,000 or 30,000 units, all in December, and without that infrastructure, it'd be very difficult to do that."" According to Amazon, since 2010, the company has invested $1 billion in Rhode Island, ""including infrastructure and compensation to employees, adding another $1 billion to the state gross domestic product."" The company also owns a delivery station and three Whole Foods Market locations throughout the state. Christopher Gavin can be reached at christopher.gavin@globe.com"

Neither, for that matter, is the Mongolian race as a whole. It is simply our reaction against the alien and the unaccustomed—together with the circumstance that our immigrant specimens are generally of a low type—which causes us to look down on the Chinese and Japanese. Both of these races, as rationally judged by their history, literature, philosophy, and art, are among the superior biological focus of the planet—and no one who is acquainted with their better classes is ever able to retain that feeling of repulsion which the ordinary American, Australian, or New-Zealander usually feels. — H. P. Lovecraft to Robert E. Howard, 7 Nov 1932, A Means to Freedom 1.481-482      The 1853 Perry Expedition forcefully ended Japanese political isolation, and during the 19th and early 20th centuries cultural and technological exchanges with the rest of the world profoundly affected both Japan and the rest of the world. The Tokugawa Shogunate was overthrown, and a new government overtook Japan—one dedicated to rapid industrialization and militarization, which in practice meant increasing Westernization. The successful adoption of Western military technology and tactics became clear during the Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), in which Japan's surprise victory over Russia fueled racist fantasies of the Yellow Peril. While Westerners feared the rising military might and aggressiveness of Japan, many were simultaneously drawn to Japanese art and culture. Japanese woodblock prints (ukiyo-e) covered a vast range of material, from purely ornamental to combinations of image and text that illustrated stories and scenes; from depictions of ordinary life and nature studies to erotica and supernatural creatures. Western interest in these woodblock prints is evident from before the U.S. intervention, but after trade was forcefully opened, the prints became much more accessible and inspired a Japonisme style in European art during the late 19th century, as well as collections and reproductions. By the 1930s, Japanese prints collections were being displayed in U.S. museums, and the names of popular and notorious artists like Hokusai Katsushika (葛飾 北斎, 1760-1849) and Hiroshige Utagawa (歌川 広重, 1797-1858) were being bandied about by newspapers. In June 1934, Providence native Abby Aldrich Rockefeller (wife of John D. Rockefeller, Jr.) donated her collection of Japanese prints to the Rhode Island School of Design. Japanese Prints Given by Mrs. Rockefeller, Jr. PROVIDENCE, R.I., June 7—(AP) The Rhode Island School of Design yesterday announced that a rare collection of Japanese prints had been presented by Mrs. John D. Rockefeller, Jr. The 623 prints, devoted chiefly to plant, bird, fish and insect life, are by the country's greatest masters. L. Earle Row, director of the school museum, said that in accordance with Mrs. Rockefeller's wishes the collection will be shown in selected groups changed at frequent intervals. —Springfield (MA) Evening Union, 7 Jun 1934, p13      That is where and how H. P. Lovecraft came to be familiar with Japanese prints. Another event was the display of the choicest of the 717 Japanese prints just acquired by the local art museum. This is a really important accession—placing our museum in competition with Boston's . . . . which boasts of having the finest Japanese print collection outside of Japan itself. The Providence collection is of the first quality, involving large numbers of items by Hokusai, Hiroshige, & kindred standbys. —H. P. Lovecraft to Richard F. Searight, 22 Dec 1934, LPS 343     Another event was an exhibition of Japanese prints—part of 700 magnificent specimens (Hokusai, Hiroshige, & all the rest) just acquired by the local art museum. This acquisition will bring Providence into competing distance of Boston—whose Museum of Fine Arts boasts the finest collection of Japanese prints outside of Japan itself. —H. P. Lovecraft to August Derleth, 22 Dec 1934, ES 2.671     More or less joined to this “art week” stuff was the first display of a choice array of the 717 Japanese prints just acquired by the local museum. This gave me quite a kick, since I am rather an enthusiast concerning Sino-Japanese art. The prints are of the finest quality, with plenty of Hokusais & Hiroshiges. A couple of weeks ago an expert lectured on the making of Japanese prints, & exhibited some of the delicately carved blocks used in their preparation. —H. P. Lovecraft to E. Hoffmann Price, 30 Dec 1934, LPS 159      It isn't exactly clear when Lovecraft gained his appreciation of Japanese art, although it seems likely he would have encountered specimens among his visits to art museums in Boston and New York in the 1920s. Providence Journal, 16 Feb 1935, p18     The RISD celebrated its recent acquisition with an exhibition of the works and a lectures, open to the public—which Lovecraft attended, as he often took advantage of the free lectures on art and science offered by the local universities. Saw a fine exhibition of Hokusai's prints—with explanatory lecture—at the museum yesterday. —H. P. Lovecraft to F. Lee Baldwin, [13 Feb 1935], LFB 123     Saw a splendid exhibition of Hokusai's prints—with explanatory lecture—at the museum yesterday. —H. P. Lovecraft to J. Vernon Shea, [19 Feb 1935], LJS 254     Some darned good lectures & exhibitions at one of your two local almae matres—the School of Design. Last week they featured Hokusai—& last night there was an illustrated discourse on Soviet art (in Memorial Hall) which would have had Sonny Belknap jumping up & down & piping! —H. P. Lovecraft to Wilfred B. Talman, [19 Feb 1935], LWT 253     Providence Journal 24 Feb 1935, p55     The Bulletin of the Rhode Island School of Design (Jan 1935) was entirely dedicated to the gift of the prints and their subsequent display, as well as providing some background on Japanese art. Lovecraft was so impressed that he couldn't help but grab a few copies to send to friends. This month there was a splendid lecture & special exhibition pertaining to my favourite Hokusai, & the entire quarterly bulletin was devoted to the subject of Japanese prints. The article was so fine, & the illustrations so graphic, that I could not resist getting several extra copies to send to especially appreciative persons. Note one mistake—on p. 19, with illus. On p. 22—where a Hokusai fan print of hibiscus flowers is erroneously attributed to Hiroshige. I wouldn't have spotted this if I had not seen the original prints & their authentic labels in the museum. —H. P. Lovecraft to Elizabeth Toldridge, 27 Feb [1935], LET 298           Later in February I heard an excellent discourse on Hokusai in connexion with an exhibition of his prints at the local art museum. Japanese art certainly appeals to me as few other aesthetic forms succeed in doing. The current museum bulletin was devoted to this subject, & contains so fine an article—together with so many excellent reproductions—that I can't resist sending you a duplicate under separate cover. —H. P. Lovecraft to R. H. Barlow, [16 Mar 1935], OFF 221-222     Of lectures there may be noted a highly interesting address on Japanese prints in general & good old Hokusai (1760-1849) in particular, held at the local museum in connexion with an exhibition of the prints. Great stuff—I have always been exceedingly fond of the delicacy, tranquility, & exquisite harmony of Sino-Japanese art. Enclosed are some cuttings illustrative of this event—which ably supplements similar events of last December. —H. P. Lovecraft to Helen V. Sully, 5 Mar 1935, LWT 404      While the..."

Email tips@dailymail.com Stephen Baldwin is proud of his daughter Hailey Bieber, 28, for selling Rhode to e.l.f. Beauty for $1 billion. 'It took her three years,' the actor told Adam Carolla during a recent episode of The Adam Carolla Show. 'What, did you think that was just some rotten tomatoes journey? The cool part of it is she's super smart, smart in business,' he continued of the 28-year-old. His kind words came in the wake of a family rift after he publicly urged fans to pray for her and her husband Justin Bieber, which she considered to be him meddling in their affairs, a source told DailyMail.com. 'Succeeded as a model prior to everything she's doing now. But the cool part was she actually had an offer to do something pretty big and cool in the cosmetics a couple years ago and didn't.' Stephen, 58, went on to explain that Hailey didn't just endorse a brand someone else came up with, she made products that she would use herself. 'The reason its succeeding is people are responding to it,' he noted. ' It actually works as hydration and all of that.' Stephen is also dad to 32-year-old daughter Alaia Baldwin Aronow and he revealed he takes a hands-off approach to his kids' careers. 'I let my kids do what they're doing,' he shared. ' And if they want to throw a boomerang at me, I'll call them back.' Plus, both of his girls are married to successful men and he gushed over Justin Bieber and Alaia's husband Andrew Aronow. As Stephen added, 'I'm blessed that my two daughters married two great guys.' He also insisted that family comes first. 'The sweet part of my kids, too, is, in the wake of whatever their success is, their dad remains the same,' he gushed. 'I've always been the same way. You know you're going to tell your daughter the truth.' And he's crediting Hailey with helping Justin through the hard time he's having lately. The Usual Suspects actor said: 'I am just glad he connected with a great gal to help him survive.' Stephen added: 'Their happiness and their wellbeing and their health is more obviously now better than ever.' In August 2024, Hailey and Justin welcomed their first child, son Jack Blues, and his grandad Stephen gushed with pride about the newborn describing him as 'incredibly cute'. Asked about the new parents, who got married in 2018 after a whirlwind romance, Stephen said that new parenthood has been 'very relaxed' for the couple. He added: 'They're just spending really sweet, private quality time with Jack and we're just getting ready to watch him come out on the world here, come out on the scene.' He also offered his babysitting services: 'Sometimes grandpa can clean up. You know what I'm saying?' Hailey is allegedly choosing to keep her parents away from her baby son Jack amid her ongoing tensions with the pair, according to sources who say she has long clashed with Stephen and Kennya Baldwin over religious and political beliefs. Though her father celebrated the birth of his grandson with a post on Instagram, which Hailey did not like from her own account, the model's mother raised eyebrows after choosing not to mark the moment on her own social media feed. It highlights Hailey's strained relationship with her parents, which reportedly started to 'break down' further when the beauty mogul fell pregnant. 'Hailey's relationship with her family has been eroding for some time now,' a source told DailyMail.com exclusively. 'She was closer with her mom, but that started to break down when she fell pregnant because she didn't want to tell her family for months.' The insider explained that the situation that ultimately pushed Hailey over the edge was when her father shared a post asking fans to pray for Hailey and Justin, something which sparked concern for the couple."

mov_1B4B8F09A779FAF4AD3F2C1CFA0ECF64,2025-07-05 20:00:00,en,WEB,"  Shrimp scampi is elegant in its simplicity, but the simplest dishes can sometimes be tricky to perfect. The ingredients have to shine, the ratios have to be perfect, and the technique has to be just right. That's why The Takeout talked to Kevin O'Donnell, chef and owner of Rhode Island's Giusto PVD. The restaurant takes on traditional Italian dishes through a Rhode Island lens, using local ingredients for inspiration. We asked him for advice on making shrimp scampi. According to O'Donnell, poaching the shrimp beforehand is a mistake because a lot of the flavor remains in the poaching liquid rather than the sauce. He also doesn't recommend tossing the shrimp in early or searing them ahead of time, as many recipes do. Instead, he takes an innovative approach. ""Depending on the size of the shrimp, I will usually add the raw shrimp to the sauce at the same time as the pasta,"" he told The Takeout. One big benefit of adding the shrimp and pasta at the same time is that it ensures perfect cooking. It's easy to overcook the shrimp if it's one of the first things in the pan, and removing the shrimp and adding them back later just adds extra hassle. And yes, in this case, using precooked shrimp could ruin your meal. O'Donnell's method means you'll only be cooking the shrimp for a couple of minutes, but that's all they need. Adding The Shrimp With The Pasta Improves The Scampi Sauce Raw shrimp on a white plate - Jordan Lye/ When you add the shrimp and pasta while reducing the sauce, it will give you a glossy, even coat that you wouldn't get from just dumping the sauce on the pasta when it's ready to serve. To make sure everything fully cooks and that the sauce reaches the desired consistency, timing is key. If you're using larger shrimp that'll take longer to cook, O'Donnell recommended slightly undercooking the pasta and splitting the shrimp. ""If the shrimp are on the larger side, then butterfly them in half,"" O'Donnell said. ""Undercook the pasta by about 45 seconds and finish cooking it in the sauce with the shrimp. This will make sure you retain all of the flavor of the shrimp in the sauce."" The flavor the shrimp imparts right into the sauce makes this shrimp scampi method a winner, though the short cook time also means there's no need to leave the tails on the shrimp. Timing can be tricky with some shrimp scampi recipes, but O'Donnell said this method works well for him. ""I've found that the timing almost always works out perfect,"" he explained. ""The sauce coats the pasta at the same time the shrimp are finished cooking."" For more food and drink goodness, join The Takeout's newsletter.

August 19th, 1991 remains the most recent event. That storm was hurricane Bob, a category 2 that did significant damage, especially to the Rhode Island coastline. Though it's been nearly 34 years since the last one, New England is very overdue for the next. All 15 hurricanes to make landfall in New England since records began in 1851 Dating back to records beginning in 1851, there have been 15 recorded hurricane landfalls in New England. That comes out to one landfall every 11-12 years on average. The longest period of time between two events was 1896 and 1938, a margin of 42 years. This means that we're currently living through the second longest quiet period in our 166 years of record keeping, and normally would have seen about three hurricanes in this time! Fortunately, only the hurricanes of 1869, 1938, and hurricane Carol in 1954 have been major hurricanes (category 3 or higher) at landfall. Cooler waters with northward extent generally weaken storms as they gain latitude. No matter how long the drought may be though, it's important to prepare for the worst as we get into late summer and fall months. It's not a matter of if, but when the next storm strikes.

mov_1100A8E52E281620E60AB807C4712936,2025-07-05 22:31:00,en,WEB,"  You may have heard the name Olivia Pichardo in sports headlines around the nation three years ago when she tried out at Division I Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. Pichardo made the cut as a walk-on and has remained a part of the Ivy League school's baseball roster since. She was the first-ever woman to play college baseball at the Division I level and is the only one to do so to this day. Pichardo made two trips to Joplin this summer as a part of the Piney Woods TimberHogs summer baseball team to face the Outlaws in Joe Becker Stadium. “I'm entering my senior year at Brown so I'm very excited to start my last year of college baseball. With this being my last year, I guess I'm looking back and seeing the path that I've taken to get to where I am today and what kind of mark   I guess   that I've left, whether it was intentional or not, on other younger girls that want to play baseball,” Pichardo said. The 5-foot-7 outfielder/pitcher from Queens, New York, played in one game in 2023, one in 2024 and three last spring. She isn't the only woman who suited up for the TimberHogs this summer. A friend and teammate on the Women's National Team for baseball, Remi Schaber, also joined the Joplin Outlaws' Mid-America League foe. Schaber plays for Division III Hood College and comes from Memphis, Tennessee, where she made headlines as a prep star for Lausanne Collegiate School. “Freshman year (college), I was just playing for me. And then the more I played, more girls came up to me and I could see that they wanted to play, too,” Schaber said. “It's a role model you didn't think you'd be.” She recalls seeing her older brother, Chase, playing baseball as she grew up and wanting to do whatever he did and that inspired her to go after baseball as well. “I was just really stubborn and didn't want to play softball,” Schaber said. “I just kept playing and I found the right coaches that gave me the opportunity.” Pichardo didn't have any older brothers. She has a sister, Nirvana. Like baseball's designated hitter position, she calls herself her dad's designated son. “My dad never had any sons so I became his designated son,” Pichardo said with a smile. “And then he put me in baseball and then I kept doing well and no one ever saw a reason why I should switch sports.” Other than these two women, some other college baseball players have been Marika Lyszczyk and Jillian Albayati. Lyszczyk is the first woman to play catcher in an NCAA baseball game. She did so for Division II Sonoma State. She's also the first Canadian woman to play an NCAA baseball game. Albayati has been a part of Team USA along with Schaber and Pichardo. Schaber, 5-foot-10, was listed as an infielder/pitcher for the TimberHogs this summer. She pitched two scoreless frames for them. But also had three outings that saw her surrender a total of 17 earned runs in her other seven innings of work. Overall, she pitched nine innings in May and June and allowed 17 earned runs. Pichardo pitched in three games, tallied six innings of work and allowed just one run. She struck out five batters. Both appeared on the mound while in Joplin. Both had shutdown innings at Joe Becker. Despite growing up far away from one another on the Eastern side of the United States, Schaber believes the two have been playing baseball together since 2015. They've been on Team USA together since 2022. “It's been a lot of fun. It's something we look forward to every single summer. All the women on the women's national team, that's sort of what they look forward to because we don't get to see each other all year, so we know we need to cherish the three weeks we get together,” Pichardo said. “It's a really special bond because each of us have grown up in our respective states, cities, towns being the only girl playing baseball on our teams at home.” 'Trendsetters' Not only does Piney Woods manager Brian Daly said.Daly believe the women belong in the growing and competitive Mid-America League, but he's been impressed with the humility they possess. “The two most impressive things to me are one: their modesty, and that kind of just came through in their answers,” Daly said. “(Secondly) a lot of people may see this as a publicity stunt or something like that but clearly they belong. I'm telling you right now, they're here for a reason. ... Like they said, it's natural to them, but, they are trendsetters. I'm honored to be a part of it, personally.” This summer, the women also played alongside Garrett Sheffield and Pedro Martinez Jr. Sheffield and Martinez are the sons of former MLB stars Gary Sheffield and Pedro Martinez Sr. Both players commented on what they saw from their female teammates this summer...."

This is known as the right of publicity, which is based on traditional notions of privacy. The Right of Publicity is a state-based property right in the United States. Each state determines the parameters of recognition. **States with Strong Statutory Protection:** Some states, such as California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wisconsin have passed statutes regulating these rights. **States with Common Law Protection:** A statute is not a prerequisite for the Right of Publicity to be enforceable. Many states arrive at the same outcome via common law. ## **Actions for US Residents (Non-California)** **Immediate Steps:** - File complaints with your state's Attorney General consumer protection division - Contact the FTC about deceptive practices by foreign company - File deletion requests citing your state's privacy laws - Document how terms were presented (or hidden) **Legal Options:** - Right of publicity claims under state law (varies by state) - Consumer protection law violations - Unconscionable contract challenges - Class action participation ## **EU/UK Residents - Strongest Protection** **GDPR Rights:** The data subject shall have the right to obtain from the controller the erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller shall have the obligation to erase personal data without undue delay **What EU/UK Residents Can Do:** - **File GDPR deletion requests** - This is legally binding - **Complain to your Data Protection Authority** - They can fine ByteDance heavily - **Right to be forgotten** - You are entitled to request us to erase any personal data we hold about you under EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

L'espressione tedesca Sonderbauten, traducibile in ""edifici speciali"", definisce i bordelli istituiti a partire dal 1942 da Heinrich Himmler, comandante delle forze di sicurezza del Terzo Reich, nei lager nazisti. Le donne che vi venivano ""offerte"" erano le sventurate prigioniere costrette a prostituirsi con la promessa (mai mantenuta) di una rapida liberazione. Le regole del piacere. Destinati ai funzionari dislocati nei campi quale ""incentivo"" alla produzione (e per limitare i casi di omosessualità), questi luoghi avevano un preciso regolamento: i rapporti potevano essere consumati solo la sera (tranne la domenica, giorno in cui erano consentiti anche di giorno); era obbligatorio fare una doccia preliminare; gli incontri erano di massimo 15 minuti; era consentita solo la posizione del ""missionario"". Soldati guardoni.

Fotogallery 10 cose che (forse) non sai sulla prostituzione Non è il mestiere più antico del mondo. Il “più antico mestiere del mondo” è davvero il più antico? In realtà no, perché il concetto di prostituzione implica un contesto di rapporti economici e culturali che è estraneo all'uomo primitivo. Ai tempi dell'uomo preistorico la coppia era probabilmente a termine (ai 6-7 anni di età, i figli passavano sotto il controllo della tribù) e, secondo gli antropologi, nel sesso anche la donna era “cacciatrice”. Solo con l'introduzione dell'agricoltura e il passaggio dalla vita nomade a quella stanziale, circa 10 mila anni fa, nacquero, con la coppia stabile, la divisione fra sessualità maschile e femminile e, contemporaneamente, una divaricazione nel destino delle donne.

This move brings the total toll of fired federal employees up to about 16,000 — jeopardizing vital work at NOAA, including marine pollution research, weather forecasting for hurricanes and tornadoes and decisions for local fisheries that help guard against overfishing. Gathering in Washington D.C. on April 2, Democrats from the House Natural Resources Committee and a range of experts convened to express outrage, and fear at the attacks on the agency. “The problem is we fired the people that know how to operate the technology,” Val Hoyle, Democrat Member of Congress from Oregon's 4th District, told reporters at the forum. “They fired the people that know how to operate our tsunami warning system.” Cuts to an Underfunded Agency Threatens Public Safety The agency is no stranger to budget challenges. In 2021, a chief scientist for NOAA described the institution as a “$12 billion agency trapped in a $5.5 billion budget,” highlighting the longstanding discrepancy between the agency's value and its funding. More cuts to funding and staff will only make this disconnect worse, according to the Representative from Rhode Island's 2nd District. “The assertion that mass layoffs will somehow improve efficiency is not only misleading, it is outright dangerous,” said Rep. Seth Magaziner at the livestreamed public forum held on Capitol Hill. “Real people's jobs and lives are on the line. Without NOAA's real time data, emergency responders are left without the critical information they need to respond to impending disasters like wildfires, hurricanes, floods and severe storms, putting millions at risk,” added Magaziner, who is a Democrat and member of the House Natural Resources Committee. The current round of cuts to NOAA comes a couple of months ahead of peak hurricane season. Just last year, hurricanes Helene and Milton ripped through Florida and North Carolina, and local officials were able to rely on forecasting and storm tracking by NOAA during the season. Natural disaster experts and government officials have raised concerns about what their natural disaster response will look like without extreme weather event predictions. “We have a buoy off the coast of Central Oregon that is part of our tsunami warning system. It's offline. We can't get any information,” said Representative Hoyle. The National Weather Service has also halted weather balloon launches at many of its offices due to lack of staff. The balloons are key to measure temperature and wind and also signal early warnings of tornadoes. Guardrails on Overfishing Gutted Thanks to DOGE Cuts Another key role of the agency is to help manage commercial fisheries. The agency's role in day-to-day operations enables fisheries to function, but also plays a role in protecting fish populations against overfishing, a practice responsible for an estimated 5.6 million metric tons of carbon emissions released into the atmosphere each year. Though forum speakers described the industry as having a “love-hate relationship” with NOAA, both industry and policy representatives at the forum said that mass layoffs and regulatory freezes would have a crippling effect. As a result of the layoffs, the Mid-Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery was not closed on schedule for instance, and was subsequently overfished by 125 percent, said Elizabeth Lewis, senior associate attorney at the public interest law firm, Eubanks & Associates, at the forum. In February, President Trump retaliated against Maine's Governor Janet Mills for her opposition to his executive order to ban transgender athletes competing in women's sports. As a result, he temporarily froze the state's sea grant funding. “Although funding was reinstated later, it left fishing communities across the country thinking about what would happen if the state sea grant offices that they depend on also became political footballs,” said Sarah Schumann, a fisherman and advocate for local fisheries in Rhode Island. Schumann pointed out the fishing industry heavily relies on NOAA's data collection and forecasting to navigate U.S. waters amid a warming climate. Salmon in Washington State are also under threat as cuts to NOAA employees continue, according to reporting from the New York Times. An employee who ensured salmon hatcheries followed the Endangered Species Act was fired — jeopardizing current and future fish populations. Privatization of Weather Predictions Risks Accuracy “There is no weather forecast that's produced in this country that isn't dependent on NOAA, none,” said Mary Glackin at the forum. Glackin is a former deputy undersecretary at the agency and former employee at the National Weather Service. NOAA is currently operating billions of dollars worth of satellites and high performance weather infrastructure. Glackin worries that this technology and surveillance may be auctioned off to the highest bidder, which would create a monopoly among billionaires to utilize the service for private interests. This isn't the first time these programs have been threatened with privatization, as many prior administrations looked to do the same. Yet, they all came to the same conclusion, said Democratic Rep. Melanie Stansbury from New Mexico. The data was so crucial to the public interest that they could not turn it over to the private sector. If private sector ownership fails, Stansbury said, there would be catastrophic impacts. “It's very clear that at the end of the day when [Musk] leaves in a few weeks or a couple of months, all he's going to leave in his wake is a gigantic mess of court cases,” Stanbury said, before pointing to “the loss of scientists and dismantled government programs that will take years to restore [and] that has undermined our standing internationally and undermined our ability to even predict the weather.” NOAA Plays Key Role in National Security Decimating NOAA's workforce is the latest move in weakening national security preparedness, said Rear Admiral John White, the former president of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership and former superintendent of the Naval Observatory. Just last month, Atlantic journalist Jeffrey Goldberg was mistakenly added by elected officials to a group chat detailing foreign war plans. White stressed the importance of NOAA data to military operations and bases at sea, highlighting that our knowledge of oceanography was key to victory in the Cold War. “It worries me a lot because I know that there are men and women in uniform out there who rely on this information…to maintain our national security and home and away game advantage for years to come. I just don't know how that's going to turn out based on the current trend and I lose sleep every night,” White said. The Future of NOAA? Democrats on the Natural Resources Committee have sent letters to NOAA officials to ask for more information, a briefing and proposed amendments to legislation so “that [their] committee's oversight plan would include an understanding of the impact of the gutting of NOAA.” So far, Republicans in Congress and Trump administration officials have refused all of their requests...."

n1l8bwu,2025-07-06 05:25:55,en,REDDIT,"  First, to talk about “the establishment” as something to resist by protesting the fact that the literal figurehead of the establishment lost the election is laughable to me. Kamala was incredibly unpopular even with the Democrat base and through a series of coincidences got promoted to VP where she even underperformed there so hard she was hidden away from campaigning as VP. In fact, not long before Biden dropped out there was serious conversation among the American left if the democrats would be better off dropping her for a new VP. Then, after the Democrat establishment eliminated any credible threat to Biden being primaried, he started slipping in the polling due to his age related issues and unpopular politics which culminated in a disastrous debate performance followed by the heads of the party forcing him out of the race. Finally after he dropped out they immediately selected Kamala for their nominee (giving her the second most likely chance of becoming the next president of the United States) despite having awfully low support and not being elected by any meaningful share of the public. After that the VAST majority of media networks and millionaire celebrities campaigned for her allowing her to duck public appearances and favorably editing her interviews to try to salvage them in ways that no neutral candidate would be granted. She got endorsements from all sides of the political establishment this century from the quintessential establishment democrat (Joe Biden) to the quintessential establishment republicans (the Cheneys). For the first time in a very long time, as the data shows, the economic and educated profile of Democrat voters matched what would've been considered establishment Republican voting 20 years ago. You can call Trump what you want but admit that you're actively advocating FOR the establishment not against it when you discuss the impact that stopping Trump would've had on “the establishment”. Next your assertions that voters are less knowledgeable about their own self interests than you require a level of audacity that is quite hard to beleive. Your unquestioning beliefs in your politics that cause you to believe that others are not fully capable agents simply wrong about what is best for them is shocking. Especially for someone that is so wrong about concepts like gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is the drawing of maps that forces non-proportional representation. While it's impossible to be perfect, the goal is to represent the residents of the state to the best ability possible, something that is easier with more population because you can fine tune districts to better serve that goal. To that end, large states like Texas, Illinois and others that intentionally draw messed up lines that are hard to justified are bad but let's examine the actual largest culprit: California. Despite only getting 60% of the house vote, Democrats received over 80% of the house seats (for a net gain of 13 seats over expected). This is MORE of a net gain for them than Republican gerrymandering had in Texas (3), Florida (4), Ohio (2) and North Carolina (3) COMBINED. These states are rightfully shown as the biggest culprits of Republican gerrymandering because they're the largest ones and the ones that are easiest to draw fair maps in. New York and Illinois are also pretty bad. But let's look further. The way our democracy was set up intends to require two houses to agree on certain bills to pass them, the House and Senate. The Senate is split between states because there was and is real concern about ensuring levels of representation for smaller states like Wyoming, Hawaii, Montana and Rhode Island that get fractions of a percent in decision making power in the house. Hypothetically speaking, without the senate the house could pass bills that benefit around 1/5 of states while screwing over the other 4/5s and would easily use that power to do so. Due to current voting trends, more smaller states tend to vote R which causes this chamber to be unbalanced in favor of Republicans but that's what the house is for, to ensure you also need the popular will of the country to pass key legislation. The House is where proportional representation is supposed to be. Currently the Republicans hold a 220-212 majority (was 220-215) but due to age related complications 3 democrats have already unfortunately died in Congress. Looking at the numbers from the last election, Republicans received 49.8% of the vote (or an expected 216.63 seats) to 47.2% of the vote (or an expected 205.32 seats). In a perfect world, minor parties would have the rest of the seats but due to geography splitting the states and votes across the state it would be impossible to draw those seats so sticking with the 2 major parties, normalizing them to 100% of the vote gives Republicans 51.3% (223 seats) of the house vote and Democrats 48.7% (212 seats) of the vote. By this metric, in a “fair” congressional election Republicans would've held 3 MORE seats giving them an even more comfortable gap to pass the bill. I'm not sure what you're looking for by “seizing the means of production” or “kinetic resistance” but the first thing to do is what the Republicans did with Trump. Forcing out the establishment figures or anyone else that offer no real solutions to your political concerns. The fact is, one party is actively trying to vote against the establishment while the other is so scared of losing they only prop up establishment figures or reactionaries with no realistic policy. This isn't a failure of the system, this IS the current will of the people."

mov_1947DF510742CEDA1ECAECE44DFBD303,2025-07-06 10:10:15,en,WEB,"  AI-assisted summary Butler Hospital workers, including nurses and mental health staff, are on strike due to unfair labor practices. The strike, the longest hospital lockout in Rhode Island history, centers around low wages and the high cost of living. Care New England, which owns Butler Hospital, has reported profits but claims it cannot afford to increase worker wages. Most people turn to mental health care during dark times, hoping to find light again. For me, it wasn't as a patient – it was as a caregiver. I'm a nurse at Butler Hospital. And while I didn't expect it, mental health care gave me purpose when I needed it most. I came to Rhode Island from Kenya 20 years ago. My wife and I raise our family here. We've built a life here. After I lost my job in a layoff, I found meaning in my per diem job at a mental health facility. That experience changed my life. I became a mental health worker, then a nurse. Now I care for patients when they're at their lowest. But I haven't seen my patients in over 40 days; I worry about them. But I'm on an unfair labor practice strike for them, and for every worker at Butler who deserves more than the crumbs we've been handed. This is not just any strike. This is the longest hospital lockout in Rhode Island history – and it should matter to everyone who cares about our health care system, our working families, and the values we say we stand for. Being locked out isn't easy. We are risking our paychecks. We've stepped away from the people we care for. But we did it because management left us no choice. Butler's wages are below the market rate. Many of us could not afford rent or groceries; despite working full-time, we continue to fall behind. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. Meanwhile, Care New England, which has posted gains twice so far this year, claims it can't afford to pay its staff a living wage. This while 60% of the staff at Butler Hospital said in a survey they struggled to pay for housing and food costs. It's insulting. And we're done staying quiet. We are nurses, techs, mental health workers, clerical staff, housekeepers and dietary workers. We are the ones who keep Butler Hospital running and we are being treated as if we don't matter. But we do! Care New England officials seem to think this is a waiting game. That if they drag this out long enough, we'll give up. But they've forgotten who health care workers are. We are built to last, showing up in life's hardest moments and don't back down. Not for our patients, and not for ourselves. The silence from some of our state leaders, like the governor, has been just as painful. While many lawmakers make it a point to come to the picket line and show their support, the governor and other top state officials have shown little to no interest in standing with us in our time of need. Where are they when we need them most? We've been scraping by for years; Care New England has been paying us poverty wages for a long time and struggle is nothing new. It's made us resilient, resourceful and relentless, but it shouldn't be this way. We're prepared to endure, we're prepared to fight, because we stand together as Butler workers agreeing change is needed and it is needed now. We didn't want a strike. We just want a fair contract. But we will not accept one that keeps us in poverty while executives profit. We're asking for a chance, a chance to live with dignity, to care for our families, to return to the work we love without being treated like we're disposable. This isn't just about us...."

mov_A3E1A0B6F7AFC50FB76E68EE2188998C,2025-07-06 11:10:00,en,WEB,"  Former New York Islanders defenseman Noah Dobson, who was traded to the Montreal Canadiens in June, married Alexa Serowik in Newport, Rhode Island. The wedding took place at Rosecliff Mansion, in the presence of friends and former teammates. Players like Mathew Barzal, Matt Martin and Anthony Beauvillier attended the wedding. Noah Dobson and Alexa got engaged in July 2024 and had their wedding in July 2025. Beauvillier's partner Emma Simard shared pictures from the wedding in a post on Instagram, writing: ""Just Love  Celebrating the Dobsons "" In one photo, Beauvillier and his partner, Emma Simard, stood outside the Rosecliff Mansion, smiling at each other while sharing a kiss. Beauvillier wore a black suit with a white shirt and black tie while Simard donned a sleeveless black dress that went below her knees. She carried a black handbag and wore black heels with pointed toes. Another photo showed Noah Dobson dancing with Alexa. He wore a white tuxedo jacket with black pants while Alexa donned a white wedding dress. They smiled at each other while dancing on a wooden floor as a live band played behind them. Jean-Gabriel Pageau was also at the wedding, with his partner Camille Pageau. Both couples posed in front of a modern gold wall. The ladies wore dresses while Beauvillier and Pageau donned suits. Here are some other moments from the wedding: The dining area inside the mansion was decorated with red tablecloths and tall candles. The room had large paintings, detailed walls and a chandelier. In one outdoor photo, Beauvillier posed for a picture with Mat Barzal and Matt Martin, who were standing near a fountain right beside the ocean. In another photo at the same spot, Beauvillier and Simard also posed for a picture. They stood close to each other, smiling at the camera. Noah Dobson's partner Alexa's surprise bachelorette party Earlier in March, the Montreal Canadiens' D-man's wife, Alexa, had a surprise bachelorette party in New York City. The Islanders' partners planned it with a “Mob Wives” theme. The group wore black outfits with heels and sunglasses. ""Islanders Bachelorette‍♀️ Thank you to you all for making it so special I can't wait to marry you @n_dobson ❤️"" Noah Dobson's partner Alexa wrote in her caption. The party started with a bus ride and ended with brunch at Maison Close. Alexa wore a sheer crystal dress by Lee Petra Grebenau. They danced on tables to fun music.

There are still states to this day where having a reduced price on drinks for happy hour is outlawed. But that has been changing in recent years.

Fueled by psychological intensity and a fresh visual language, the series stands at the intersection of fantasy and inner reckoning, offering a narrative that is both personal and primal. Set over the course of a single lunar cycle, 28 Days with the Alpha follows a gripping countdown where transformation is not just physical but profoundly emotional. The series captures a unique urgency: each episode moves closer to an irreversible fate, pulling the audience deeper into themes of identity, power, and fear of the unknown. Following the success of Unwanted Mate —voted Best Werewolf-Themed Project of 2024 by audiences—Zhang Chi advances the genre with elevated storytelling. While Unwanted Mate explored resilience through romance and survival, 28 Days with the Alpha ventures into darker territory, reflecting on inner conflict, inherited trauma, and the primal cost of self-denial. The creative foundation for the series draws from Zhang Chi's rich artistic background. Raised in Beijing, she grew up immersed in Chinese painting and calligraphy before studying Arts, Entertainment, and Media Management at Columbia College Chicago. Her tenure at Legendary Entertainment, where she contributed to global productions such as Dune , Godzilla vs. Kong , and Detective Pikachu , shaped her cinematic sensibilities before she pivoted toward high-impact, vertical-format storytelling. Production on 28 Days with the Alpha was a study in precision. The storyline's tension-driven calendar format demanded strict continuity and real-time emotional escalation. To mirror the series' lunar pacing, the production team adapted schedules, lighting, and set transitions to support an evolving emotional tone, enhancing realism through strategic design. With each passing day in the story, characters unravel and truths surface. Unlike typical werewolf narratives centered around external conflict, 28 Days with the Alpha internalizes the transformation, revealing how monsters are often born within. This philosophical layering has resonated with early viewers and test audiences, who praised the series for its character-driven depth and emotional sophistication.

27e32e3f5046eeb1b6c566e097980591,2025-07-06 13:15:00,en,WEB,"  21 Food And Drinks You Definitely Remember If You Grew Up In New England We may receive a commission on purchases made from links. There are few identities that I am more proud of in my life than being a New Englander. I was born and raised in Connecticut before moving to Vermont and then Rhode Island, where I happily reside today. Geographically speaking, New England is such a small region — Texas is more than three times larger. Despite its small size, New England boasts incredible diversity, not just in its population but also in its cuisine. I have eaten my fair share of foods in the region over the years and seen how the hearty fare of Northern Vermont differs from the coastal bounty of southern New England. To bring back some food memories for New England ex-pats or strike a chord with fellow New England residents, I've come up with a list of some of the tastiest and most iconic foods of the region, including their history, variations, and how to best enjoy them. They should all be on your must-try list if you plan on visiting the region, though many can also be made at home or ordered right to your doorstep. After all, I believe being a New Englander isn't just an identity; it's a state of mind. 1. Hoodsie cups No childhood birthday party or classroom celebration was complete without Hoodsie cups. These small half-and-half containers of chocolate and vanilla ice cream are produced by Massachusetts giant Hood. The single-serve cups emerged on the market in 1947 and remain a popular staple in the southern New England states. They're easily recognizable, thanks to their small shape and the inclusion of a wooden spoon (really, a stick) for eating. While New Englanders may have fond memories of these cups, you can still purchase them in grocery stores around New England today. They're best enjoyed sans toppings and with the sound of a schoolyard field day in the background. 2. Moxie Moxie: Love it or hate it, it's New England's soda. The brand's tagline, now under Coca-Cola ownership, says it all: distinctively different. Its flavor has undercurrents of both sweet and bitter (though mostly bitter) and almost tastes like an amalgamation of Coca-Cola, root beer, and Dr. Pepper. Moxie was originally created in 1884 by Dr. Augustin Thompson. The Maine-made soda was one of the first ever to be produced and was made with gentian root extract, which gave the soda its unique flavor and its purported medicinal properties. The soda became Maine's state beverage in 2005 and for many years, lived on at the now-shuttered Moxie Museum in Union. Though it takes up far less shelf space than other soda brands, you can still find Moxie in general stores and some supermarkets across New England. 3. Steak tips I don't know exactly why steak tips have such a foothold in the New England food scene, both past and present, but I can't say that I'm mad about it. They're popular in the southern New England states, especially Massachusetts, and are made with sirloin flap meat or hanger steak. These cuts were historically undesirable, but New England chefs used Yankee ingenuity to make them appealing. The small cubes of steak are tossed into a simple marinade, often just Italian dressing or some sort of barbecue-like sauce, before being cooked until just slightly charred. Steak tips are great eaten straight from the pan, though some folks also like to add them to salads. The origin of steak tips is contested, but it's more than likely a food born out of frugality and resourcefulness — as chefs wanted to make the most out of the cow. However, prominent names like New England chain favorite Ninety Nine take some ownership over the history of this iconic New England dish, alleging that its staff were the first ones to marinate the meat in Italian dressing. 4. New York System There are so many different regional styles of hot dogs, including the Rhode Island favorite: the New York System. It's one of the best sandwiches you can order in the state and comes packed with a wiener (not a hot dog, important distinction here) made with pork, veal, and beef, topped with mustard, chili, chopped white onion, and celery salt, and tucked into a steamed bun. The dish has ties to the Greek community and has been in the state for more than 100 years. The best spot to order one of these hot wieners is Olneyville New York System, which has locations in Providence and Cranston. Enjoy it with a glass of cold coffee milk and relish one of the Ocean State's best offerings. 5. Creemees Before you ask, no, a creemee is not just soft serve ice cream. It's a frozen dessert experience nestled inside a cake cone. Vermonters know creemees well, and they also know the best hole-in-the-wall joints serving up these sweet treats. Allegedly, this unique title was given to the dessert to distinguish it from soft serve, seeing as it's made with a higher butterfat content and has a, well, creamier mouthfeel. While some stands sell creemees in basic flavors like vanilla and chocolate, Vermonters know that there is only one (well, two — black raspberry is pretty darn good, too) flavor worth ordering: maple...."
mov_4ADAEFD9104AF9E1DA92FA0CC10ABE93,2025-07-06 13:18:40,en,WEB,"  Taylor Swift's famous Fourth of July party did not happen this year for the second year in a row. They are held at her Rhode Island mansion. Taylor Swift opted to bow out of her Fourth of July party for the second year in a row. The party is held at her Rhode Island mansion, which she has been renovating this year. The additional upgrades to her infamous home could be a reason why she decided not to have the party this year; however, it's unclear if that was the actual reason she chose not to have the celeb-filled bash. Her last party was in 2023, where Swift kept the vibes to only her best friends, Selena Gomez, Este Haim, Danielle Haim, and Alana Haim. The singer has been throwing the parties since 2016 and guests such as Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, Gigi Hadid, Karlie Kloss, Cara Delevingne, Tom Hiddleston, Zoë Kravitz, Emma Stone, and Ed Sheeran, to name a few. In 2024, Swift was on her record-breaking Eras Tour and she was performing all around Europe. Her boyfriend, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, even joined her for a couple of stops and made his debut on stage in London. Her being busy on tour checks out as to why there was no holiday party that year. For this year, it makes sense for her not to throw a party — even though some fans were convinced she was — since she is prioritizing her relationship with Kelce. He is currently in his offseason for the NFL and will begin training camp later this month. The couple is most likely just soaking up these last few weeks before the tight end will be busy again with practices and games. A source recently told People that they are enjoying this current season of their relationship. “It's been a turning point for their relationship in a lot of ways, the source explained. “They're incredibly happy and in sync. There's a calmness and ease to their relationship right now that's been really grounding for Taylor and Travis.” “Taylor and Travis are soaking up every minute of this slower season together,” the source continued. “They've been splitting their time between New York, Nashville, and a few quiet getaways, just enjoying each other's company without all the usual chaos. This kind of downtime is rare for both of them, and it's really allowed their bond to deepen.” Kelce recently made an appearance on the Bussin' With The Boys podcast — hosted by former NFL players Will Compton and Taylor Lewan — where the three-time Super Bowl champion shared that people online are accusing him and Swift of “seeking attention” which the athlete denied. “It gets thrown out there, like we're trying to seek attention every now and then,” Kelce said on the podcast. “We're just enjoying life and having fun going to hockey games, kinda introducing her to some more of the sports world.” Not giving more people online ammo to continue to accuse the couple of wanting to be in the spotlight is another reason why Swift might have opted not to show a party this year. Hopefully, her event comes back next year and it's bigger than ever. Autumn Hawkins is an entertainment and celebrity associate editor for ClutchPoints.

mov_8B784FCCADBEFE60519A166EC3D61A73,2025-07-06 14:29:13,en,WEB,"  There won't be many opportunities in the near future for the United States men's national team to play against competitive opposition before hosting the World Cup. It's what aggravated many fans, pundits, and former players for the team when staple stars like Christian Pulisic opted out of taking the field at the Gold Cup this summer. Traditionally, the Gold Cup has been more of a proving ground for the USMNT than a representative of the best team the United States can offer. Still, criticism came and doubts abounded for Mauricio Pochettino and his squad ahead of the tournament after two embarrassing defeats at the hands of Turkey in Connecticut and Switzerland in Nashville. Fast forward to today: the USMNT is in the final of the tournament for the first time in three attempts and will face heated rivals Mexico in Houston on Sunday. Not only will it be a second chance for Pochettino to win his first piece of silverware with the US (he lost the CONCACAF Nations League earlier this year), but it will also be the final chance for some players to prove they have what it takes to succeed in international competitive football. Many have already (seemingly) solidified their roster spots for World Cup 2026. Some have played poorly enough that their inclusion should be debated. Others have work to do at the club level to prove that they belong at the top of positional depth charts. In: Diego Luna If the USMNT beats Mexico to win the Gold Cup on Sunday, there's no doubt that Diego Luna should be taking home the award for best player. The 21-year-old Real Salt Lake star had been playing second-division soccer with the USL Championship's El Paso Locomotive just a few years ago. Now, it'd be truly surprising if a healthy Luna wasn't selected for the World Cup roster. He scored his first international goal in the quarterfinal against Costa Rica and then followed that up with a winning brace against Guatemala in the semifinals. Add two assists to his tally and the USMNT's young talisman should have more than proven that he belongs on next summer's roster. Work to do: Patrick Agyemang Patrick Agyemang's rise to consistent USMNT minutes is a heartwarming story. The East Hartford, Connecticut man played Division III ball at Eastern Connecticut State before transferring to Rhode Island, becoming a first-round MLS Superdraft pick for Charlotte FC, and now is linked with a move to Derby County. It's a great tale of perseverance and defying the odds. Unfortunately for him, there may be more odds to defy. Much like many of these positions, striker is pretty well-set for the USMNT when everyone is healthy. First-choice option Folarin Balogun had a rough season at Monaco, but could easily rebound. PSV proved to be a perfect landing spot for Ricardo Pepi. Add in the likes of Norwich City's Josh Sargeant and (seemingly) the most under-appreciated forward in the USMNT pipeline in Club America's Alex Zendejas, and it's clear that Agyemang needs to continue scoring at a high rate to push for a spot. He's capable, that's not a question. But with two goals in this Gold Cup campaign, he'll need to keep pushing to clinch that roster spot. Out: Luca de la Torre The Gold Cup is typically a tournament where inexperienced footballers play their way in to the World Cup roster. Luca de la Torre, the seventh-most experienced member of this Gold Cup squad, may have played his way out. While the arguments for 'work to do' or even the next person on the 'out' list could be matter of interpretation, it can't be denied that the San Diego FC signing has looked the most out-of-place of anyone on this roster. Midfield is going to be a tough position to whittle down a roster for. Tyler Adams, Weston McKennie, and Yunus Musah are likely to return to their roles from 2022. Luna, as we mentioned, is set to challenge that hegemony. Others like Johnny Cardoso and Brenden Aaronson could see the roster as well. So when faced with the chances to showcase his best, de la Torre just has not delivered. His performances in the 1-0 win to Saudi Arabia and the 2-1 win against Guatemala leave a lot to be desired. Considering the depth in the middle of the field, it's not hard to envision de la Torre being left behind. In: Malik Tillman There's good reason why Malik Tillman is on the verge of a move to Bayer Leverkusen and he's showed that all tournament long. It's not like Tillman's spot in the World Cup roster was severely in doubt, but his performances for the USMNT showed just how pivotal he can be. With three goals and two assists across five games - including two Man of the Match performances - Tillman could be vital for Pochettino next summer. Work to do: Matt Freese Freese will be in the roster for the 2026 World Cup, barring injury. He's played decently enough in the Gold Cup to ensure that. Where the work lies is his role for next summer, because currently, the starting keeper spot is wide open for the USMNT. Freese has been a net decent in this Gold Cup. Dramatic errors in the game against Haiti were followed up by penalty shootout heroics against Costa Rica. All that's left is to continue his strong club season with New York City FC - where he's conceded 20 goals in 17 matches while keeping six clean sheets. Whether or not that's enough to ward off efforts from Columbus Crew keeper Patrick Schulte or the currently-between-clubs Matt Turner (both of whom have more experience in net for the US) remains to be seen. Work to do: Max Arfsten..."

888bb51afecf0cd445777784938d8364,2025-07-06 18:02:00,en,WEB,"  Craig McCormick Smith was sick, and his oldest daughter was getting ready for a scuba-diving trip in Papua New Guinea. She jokingly told him nothing could get her to cancel the vacation, but his response was serious: “Go.” Though Smith spent decades working hard and building successful trucking and real estate businesses, his true joys were outside the office. He was a lover of adventures, of journeys abroad and new experiences. If he could have kept traveling until his last breath, he would have. He wanted the same for his children. So Eliza Smith Steinmeier went to Papua New Guinea. She didn't think her father would have liked scuba diving much, but he could have spent all day fishing on those waters. He would have loved learning about the local culture. When she got the call that he died, it wasn't a question whether she would head back — “I know he wouldn't have wanted me to come home,” she said. In his work life, “I think he was a hard-ass,” Smith Steinmeier said. “He ran a small business; you have to keep a tight ship. … In his personal life, he was one of the most generous people I've ever met.” Smith, a commercial real estate developer who also used to run a family trucking business in Baltimore, died June 7 of lung cancer. He was 82. He was born Feb. 18, 1943, the oldest of two children born to Stuart “Stu” Moore Smith and Edith McCormick Smith. He and his sister, Judith “Judy” Smith Mowlds, spent most of their childhood in small-town Pennsylvania before moving to Baltimore in 1957 as his father grew the family business. Smith was initially enrolled in Baltimore City College, but he found the school far too big and busy. Instead, he spent four years at Loyola High School. He wasn't the biggest academic, but he participated in just about every sport available to him. He was especially good at football, like his father, and played offensive and defensive tackle. A former coach later told Smith's loved ones that “he was the meanest football player he'd ever coached.” Smith continued playing football at the College of William & Mary in Virginia, graduating in 1965. While in college, he married his first wife, but they were divorced a few years later. In 1969, after his father died, Smith took over Stuart M. Smith Inc., the family trucking company. He spent more than a decade operating the business, mostly delivering Tastykake products. A few years later, he met Elaine Perfetto Smith, a neighbor who had just moved to Baltimore from Rhode Island. She was also divorced, and the two became quick friends and golf buddies. They married in 1974, and their first child, Eliza, was born two years later. Craig Smith was nervous about having a child. “He was a very devoted father once he got over his anxiety about being one,” his wife said. “He was very gentle, very kind, and established within himself a priority to do the very best he could for his family.” In 1980, they had their second daughter, Christina Fenton, and soon after adopted their son, Kevin Smith. The family made it a priority to have dinner together every night. Smith was a bit of a disciplinarian, and he was especially protective of his daughters, family said. But inside he was a big softie, they said, who loved cleaning the house with his children just because it gave them the opportunity to chat. He taught them to golf, fish and ski, and they had many memorable trips to their vacation house on the Eastern Shore. “He grew up with a lot of adult responsibilities from a young age, so he kind of went the other way with us,” Fenton said. He had a tradition of sending Fenton roses on her birthday each year, with the number of flowers matching her new age. He'd send them to school, so she'd pick them up from the front office. He continued to send the bouquets probably until she was married. The family often vacationed with Smith's good friend, Tom Bozzuto, who fondly recalled smoking cigars, drinking bourbon and fishing together. He described his friend as a “real man's man, with a laugh that always sounded like you caught him taking the last cookie out of the jar.” In 1982, Smith reconnected with a high school classmate, Pat Creaney, and they decided to start a real estate development business together. The Creaney & Smith Group was born, and the duo acquired and developed more than 7 million square feet of commercial property throughout the mid-Atlantic. Smith came off as a “very hard-nosed, tough businessman,” though it was mostly a facade, Creaney said. Smith was good with numbers and led the operations side of the company. He also brought family into the business and worked for many years with Fenton. Smith was “very thorough, very detailed and very straightforward, and honest,” his business partner said. “There wasn't a dishonest bone in his body.”..."

A week later, after the financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect. The negotiating window until July 9 has led to announced deals only with the United Kingdom and Vietnam. Trump imposed elevated tariff rates on dozens of nations that run meaningful trade surpluses with the U.S., and a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries in response to what he called an economic emergency. There are separate and a 25% tariffs on autos. Since April, few foreign governments have set new trade terms with Washington as the Republican president demanded. Trump told reporters early Friday that his administration might be sending out letters as early as Saturday to countries spelling out their tariff rates if they did not reach a deal, but that the U.S. would not start collecting those taxes until Aug. 1. On Friday night, he said he would “probably send out 10 or 12” letters on Monday, each reflecting “different amounts of money, different amounts of tariffs and somewhat different statements.” He and his advisers have declined to say which countries would receive the letters. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent rejected the idea that Aug. 1 was a new deadline and declined to say what might happen Wednesday. “We'll see,"" Bessent said on CNN's State of the Union. "" I'm not going to give away the playbook.” He said the U.S. was “close to several deals,” and predicted several big announcements over the next few days. He gave no details. ""I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,” Bessent said. Trump has announced a deal with Vietnam that would allow U.S. goods to enter the country duty-free, while Vietnamese exports to the U.S. would face a 20% levy. That was a decline from the 46% tax on Vietnamese imports he proposed in April — one of his so-called reciprocal tariffs targeting dozens of countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit. Asked if he expected to reach deals with the or India, Trump said Friday that “letters are better for us” because there are so many countries involved. “We have India coming up and with Vietnam, we did it, but much easier to send a letter saying, 'Listen, we know we have a certain deficit, or in some cases a surplus, but not too many. And this is what you're going to have to pay if you want to do business in the United States.” Canada, however, will not be one of the countries receiving letters, Trump's ambassador, Pete Hoekstra, said Friday after trade talks between the two countries recently resumed. “Canada is one of our biggest trading partners,” Hoekstra told CTV News in an interview in Ottawa. “We're going to have a deal that's articulated.""

mov_C03E0F11CEC9ABD2B2B8CB035DEF43CE,2025-07-06 18:11:54,en,WEB,"  WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is stepping up pressure on trading partners to quickly make new deals before a Wednesday deadline, with plans for the United States to start sending letters Monday warning countries that higher tariffs could kick in Aug. 1. That furthers the uncertainty for businesses, consumers and America's trading partners, and questions remain about which countries will be notified, whether anything will change in the days ahead and whether President Donald Trump will once more push off imposing the rates. Trump and his top trade advisers say he could extend the time for dealmaking but they insist the administration is applying maximum pressure on other nations. Kevin Hassett, director of the White House National Economic Council, told CBS' “Face the Nation” on Sunday that Trump would decide when it was time to give up on negotiations. “The United States is always willing to talk to everybody about everything,” Hassett said. “There are deadlines, and there are things that are close, so maybe things will push back past the deadline or maybe they won't. In the end the president is going to make that judgment.” Stephen Miran, the chair of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, likewise said countries negotiating in good faith and making concessions could “sort of, get the date rolled.” The steeper tariffs that President Donald Trump announced April 2 threatened to overhaul the global economy and lead to broader trade wars. A week later, after the financial markets had panicked, his administration suspended for 90 days most of the higher taxes on imports just as they were to take effect. The negotiating window until July 9 has led to announced deals only with the United Kingdom and Vietnam. Trump imposed elevated tariff rates on dozens of nations that run meaningful trade surpluses with the U.S., and a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries in response to what he called an economic emergency. There are separate 50% tariffs on steel and aluminum and a 25% tariffs on autos. Since April, few foreign governments have set new trade terms with Washington as the Republican president demanded. Trump told reporters early Friday that his administration might be sending out letters as early as Saturday to countries spelling out their tariff rates if they did not reach a deal, but that the U.S. would not start collecting those taxes until Aug. 1. On Friday night, he said he would “probably send out 10 or 12” letters on Monday, each reflecting “different amounts of money, different amounts of tariffs and somewhat different statements.” He and his advisers have declined to say which countries would receive the letters. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent rejected the idea that Aug. 1 was a new deadline and declined to say what might happen Wednesday. “We'll see,"" Bessent said on CNN's State of the Union. "" I'm not going to give away the playbook.” More in Politics He said the U.S. was “close to several deals,” and predicted several big announcements over the next few days. He gave no details. ""I think we're going to see a lot of deals very quickly,” Bessent said. Trump has announced a deal with Vietnam that would allow U.S. goods to enter the country duty-free, while Vietnamese exports to the U.S. would face a 20% levy. That was a decline from the 46% tax on Vietnamese imports he proposed in April — one of his so-called reciprocal tariffs targeting dozens of countries with which the U.S. runs a trade deficit. Asked if he expected to reach deals with the European Union or India, Trump said Friday that “letters are better for us” because there are so many countries involved. “We have India coming up and with Vietnam, we did it, but much easier to send a letter saying, 'Listen, we know we have a certain deficit, or in some cases a surplus, but not too many. And this is what you're going to have to pay if you want to do business in the United States.” Canada, however, will not be one of the countries receiving letters, Trump's ambassador, Pete Hoekstra, said Friday after trade talks between the two countries recently resumed. “Canada is one of our biggest trading partners,” Hoekstra told CTV News in an interview in Ottawa. “We're going to have a deal that's articulated."" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has said he wants a new deal in place by July 21 or Canada will increase trade countermeasures. Hoekstra would not commit to a date for a trade agreement and said even with a deal, Canada could still face some tariffs. But “we're not going to send Canada just a letter,” he said.

Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes did not come to play with their Fourth of July festivities. The couple who got married in 2022 hosted the holiday party in Miami on a massive yacht in photos obtained by TMZ. The Mahomes were celebrating a friend's birthday as well as the holiday and dressed in red, white, and blue. Brittany opted for a blue one-piece and white linen pants, and Patrick wore a white tank and blue shorts. The couple, along with their friends, wore a “1995” trucker hat. Did Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce Celebrate The Fourth of July With Patrick Mahomes and Brittany Mahomes? It's possible that Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift hung out with the Mahomes for the holiday since the singer did not throw her infamous Fourth of July bash. Swift usually holds a large party at her Rhode Island mansion but this year she opted not to. It makes sense why Swift decided to have a low-key celebration this year since the last time she threw a party was in 2023. That year, the singer kept her circle small and just had her best friends, Selena Gomez, Este Haim, Danielle Haim, and Alana Haim to attend. Last year, the singer had no time to throw a party as she was in Europe for her international leg of her record-breaking Eras Tour. Kelce even joined her on a couple of stops while he was in his offseason. A reason why Swift could have wanted to keep her celebration private is because her relationship with Kelce is evolving and they are prioritizing one another in this next chapter. “It's been a turning point for their relationship in a lot of ways,” a source told People. “They're incredibly happy and in sync. There's a calmness and ease to their relationship right now that's been really grounding for Taylor and Travis.” “Taylor and Travis are soaking up every minute of this slower season together,” the source continued. “They've been splitting their time between New York, Nashville, and a few quiet getaways, just enjoying each other's company without all the usual chaos. This kind of downtime is rare for both of them, and it's really allowed their bond to deepen.” The couple also has been receiving some backlash as some people on social media suggest they have become “attention seekers” due to their latest outings as a couple. However, Kelce denied those allegations. “It gets thrown out there, like we're trying to seek attention every now and then,” Kelce said on the Bussin' With The Boys podcast. “We're just enjoying life and having fun going to hockey games, kinda introducing her to some more of the sports world.” The couple is taking some time to slow down as Kelce preps for his 13th season in the NFL. An insider shared that Swift is extra excited for this season as this is the first time in the duration of their relationship that she is not on tour and can solely focus on supporting Kelce.

The June 7 episode of Monday Night Raw will air live from the Amica Mutal Pavilion in Providence, Rhode Island. The episode will serve as the go-home show for both the upcoming Saturday Night's Main Event and Evolution 2, both of which are set for this weekend. Multiple big names are advertised for the show, including World Heavyweight Champion Gunther, Seth Rollins, Rhea Ripley, Jey Uso, and Bron Breakker, among others. Stars set to clash on the show will meet for the final time on the show. WWE might also announce more matches for the shows during Raw this week. Ahead of the go-home show, here are the top five storylines that you need to watch out for on the July 7 episode of WWE Raw. 5. Women's Intercontinental Championship [embedded content] The three-way feud between Becky Lynch, Bayley, and Lyra Valkyria has seen both Lyra and Bayley try to get their hands on Lynch and capture the Women's Intercontinental title. Both women got an opportunity to face each other in a number one contender's match, which ended in a double pin, leading to a brawl between them. The controversial end and the brawl afterward signal the feud picking up steam, and it might culminate in a triple-threat match for the IC title at the upcoming Evolution 2. 4. Fatal four-way match for the Women's Tag titles As announced by General Managers Adam Pearce and Nick Aldis, Roxanne Perez and Raquel Rodriguez will defend the Tag Team titles in a fatal four-way match against a team from Raw, SmackDown, and NXT at Evolution. The team of Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss has already secured their spot on last week's show of SmackDown, and a team from Raw this week will now punch their ticket for the PLE. 3. Karrion Kross – Sami Zayn [embedded content] Karrion Kross battled Sami Zayn at Night of Champions in his first PLE match since WrestleMania 41 and his first singles PLE match since Crown Jewel 2022. Overcoming Kross' mind games, Zayn was able to secure the victory. However, it seems like Karrion still has some unfinished business as he ambushed Zayn on the recent episode of Raw, signaling that the feud is far from over. 2. Gunther – Goldberg WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg made his return, challenging the World Heavyweight Champion Gunther. The match was made official between the two for the July 12 edition of Saturday Night's Main Event. Goldberg has vowed to repay the favor for Gunther humiliating him in front of his family at Bad Blood 2024.

Seth Rollins – LA Knight [embedded content] LA Knight made his return during last week's show, attacking Seth Rollins, who was evading an attack from CM Punk. Shortly after the brawl, the promotion announced a singles clash between Knight and Rollins for the upcoming SNME. The star might engage in a promo battle on the go-home show or just decide to throw down, building up hype for the match. FAQs When and where will WWE RAW (July 7, 2025) take place?

Sparks flew almost immediately between Peggy (Denée Benton) and Dr. William Kirkland (Jordan Donica) after he treated her severe case of pneumonia earlier in Season 3. But a trip to the beach town of Newport in Episode 3, titled “Love Is Never Easy,” sealed the start of their courtship after the doctor invited Peggy on a walk along the cliffs. “That was such a beautiful day, truly, because it actually does look as stunning as it does in the episode,” Benton told TheWrap of filming the idyllic first date. “To see it with us in those really vibrant costumes, and all the other Black couples and their costumes like eating grapes and sitting, it was transporting.” “I think it was about time she had some joy … often that comes out of strange circumstances,” series co-writer Sonja Warfield told TheWrap of the romantic twist following Peggy's health scare. Peggy's new love interest was a welcome one for Benton and new cast addition Jordan Donica, who stepped into the role of William after previously working together in “Into the Woods” on Broadway. The rapport from that prior experience helped the duo step into the vulnerability of playing romantic interests more seamlessly. “I was so thrilled when I was asked to join and be a part of this cast. [Denée] made it so easy from day one,” Donica told TheWrap. “It's so vulnerable to play a love interest, so feeling safe with each other and the chemistry certainly helps,” Benton added. Complications arose after Peggy's introduction to William's prominent Newport family, led by Elizabeth (Phylicia Rashad) and pastor Frederick Kirkland (Brian Stokes Mitchell). Slight tensions boiled between Elizabeth, Peggy and her parents Arthur (John Douglas Thompson) and Dorothy (Audra McDonald) when they sensed her looking down on them for their differing family histories: Specifically, that Elizabeth's family has been free and living in Rhode Island for five generations, while Arthur had started his own pharmacy in Brooklyn after becoming free himself as a young man. Phylicia Rashad in “The Gilded Age.” (Karolina Wojtasik/HBO) Elizabeth also showed signs of colorism, admonishing the family nanny for letting her grandchildren play outside for too long — risking their skin tones getting darker. “She feels like the Agnes of Newport to me in that she doesn't apologize in the slightest for her limited points of view,” Benton said. “It was incredible watching Phylicia play it with such sincerity. It creates such a beautiful tension to play against, having that kind of obstacle is really thrilling.” More in Entertainment For Warfield, the storyline offered an opportunity to explore the perspective of the Black elites who existed in that era — as well as the divide that existed between free Black people and the recently emancipated. The “real issue” of colorism within the Black community also became a prevalent theme for the season. “I feel like people love our show because of the beautiful, camp drama. And then I also do they think they come to learn something,” Benton added. “Exploring the nuances of the Black communities in that time, Black wealth and the white supremacy that still found its way into those dynamics, is really interesting meat to get into.” “The Gilded Age” airs Sundays on HBO and Max."

The relationship between the 31-year-old singer and his 28-year-old wife has been subject to plenty of speculation and reports in recent weeks with rumours of a breakup. However, Justin looks to have shrugged off any suggestion of a split with a four-word post on Instagram. Justin shared a series of sunset snaps with his wife on Sunday as they relaxed on a balcony together. Although Hailey's face could only be partially be seen in the photos – one them just showed the back of her head – Justin was clear in the caption. He wrote: 'My forever n always.' Justin and Hailey first met in 2009 and started dating six years later, and the rekindled their one/off romance in 2018 following his split from Selena Gomez. The couple welcomed their first son Jack into the world last August. Fans have been speculating about Justin's wellbeing for months after some erratic behaviour on social media. At the beginning of the year, he unfollowed the Rhode Beauty founder on Instagram, but refollowed her the same morning and claimed: 'Someone went on my account and unfollowed my wide.' A couple of months later, Hailey unfollowed the Love Yourself hitmaker for a couple of days, which she insisted was 'a glitch'. There have been reports that she has has become 'really concerned' about his behaviour', while in April her husband shared a lengthy and rambling post about people being 'jealous' of their marriage. The following month, Justin left his fans baffled after he revealed a fight they once had to commemorate her first Vogue magazine cover. He wrote of how he once told her during a 'huge fight' that she would 'never be on the cover of Vogue'. 'Yikes, I know, so mean,' he reflected, adding: 'So baby u already know but forgive me for saying u wouldn't get a vogue cover cuz clearly i was sadly mistaken. (sic)' He later deleted the post, while he has continued to leave fans confused by his social media activity. Last month, he suggested love shouldn't be conditional as he hit out at 'transactional relationships', while he later opened up and 'anger issues' and called himself 'broken' in an emotional statement. Hailey has since been seen without her wedding, ring, although days later she dismissed the rumours with a mirror selfie showing her ring on her hand.

mov_3F966876AFB01266E134528656B84AC4,2025-07-07 09:00:00,en,WEB,"  A pair of buses is about to roll into Central Florida, but they won't be picking up commuters or be part of our public transportation network. Instead, they'll be offering something far more vital: a safe night's sleep. “We're a little more excited to do this bus than probably all the other ones,” said Anthony Rommell, who helped build the custom motor coaches. “(And) it's not just one – there's going to be two.” Those two buses are the centerpiece of 407 Connect , a new initiative aiming to make a dent in Orlando's homelessness crisis through innovation and compassion. Custom-designed by The Source, a Vero Beach-based nonprofit , the so-called “Dignity Buses” will soon offer overnight shelter with a twist: they're mobile, private, air-conditioned vehicles customized by people who know homelessness firsthand. [RELATED: Debunking 8 myths about homelessness in Central Florida ] They are designed to get homeless people off the street by providing space for a good night's sleep in a controlled and comfortable environment. “This is more than a bus,” Rommell said. “It's a safe place.” The first bus will be ready in the next few weeks – The Source's second build for 407 Connect will be ready to enter service shortly thereafter. Funding for 407 Connect was made possible through a public/private partnership between the City of Orlando's Community Redevelopment Agency and the Christian Service Center for the Homeless . [WATCH: Orange County spends millions to house homeless people in jail. Is there a better way?] The program is a stepping stone to a broader plan to help combat homelessness that's pretty straightforward: create a safe, mobile space to sleep, give people a foundation to build on, and move forward from there. Each person who uses the bus will receive support from CSC's case management team to help them find permanent housing. The two 45-foot Orlando-bound motor coaches are The Source's sixth and seventh builds. Three buses are up and running in Vero Beach, and two are in service out of state. And they're all slightly different. “I would have never thought we'd have three buses here, one in Rhode Island, one in Illinois, and two going to Orlando,” said Tony Zorbaugh, executive director of The Source. [RELATED: Stories about homelessness in Central Florida ] According to Zorbaugh, The Source created the first mobile sleep bus for homeless people in the country shortly after the pandemic began back in 2021, able to sleep 16. Bus No. 2 had sleeping accommodations for 19, and Bus No. 3 slept 20. The 407 Connect buses will also have sleeping pods for 20 people, with one more pod fully accessible via a rear wheelchair lift. Bunk beds line both walls, and individual cubbies for personal belongings are tucked underneath. Some of the previous builds by The Source incorporated a washer-dryer set, running water, and on one bus, a triple bunk. The out-of-state buses for Illinois and Rhode Island were outfitted with beefed-up heating elements, and each converted bus has a distinct exterior design. Team members learn something different from each project and adapt as they go along. “The whole thing for (this build) was: how can we go about getting more room on the bus?” Rommell said. “Because all our other buses have been so compact and tight. So, we think we figured it out.” [PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Orlando to consider converting buses into mobile homeless shelters] The Source was founded as a soup kitchen but has grown into something much larger. It now provides transitional housing, work opportunities, and support services for people experiencing homelessness. It's also become something of an unlikely customization shop gutting, designing, and rebuilding long-haul coaches into mobile sanctuaries. Rommell told News 6 that he brings his stepfather's carpentry lessons to the job. “He taught me everything I know to this point,” Rommell said. “If it wasn't for him, I probably wouldn't be where I'm at now.” Kyle McNeill, the other half of The Source's interior build team, has seen the program from both sides. “Yeah, I was homeless,” McNeill said as he told the story of how he rode his bicycle from Texas to Florida years ago in search of a new start. “Lack of ID, no way to get it. Of course, it was post-pandemic time, so when I came to The Source, I didn't know about having a bus to sleep on. I gave it a shot one night and I ended up sleeping on it for five months.” McNeil entered The Source's maintenance program and eventually moved into permanent housing. Now, he builds out the bus interiors to help others. “It's humbling,” McNeill told us. “Even though I don't know them, I never see them, but I know they're out there. And I know they get the benefit of sleeping safely.” [RELATED: Central Florida news outlets join forces on homelessness crisis]"

Tonight's episode of Monday Night Raw will serve as the go-home show for both the upcoming Saturday Night's Main Event and Evolution 2, both of which are set for this weekend. The show will air live from the Amica Mutal Pavilion in Providence, Rhode Island. Women's Intercontinental Champion Becky Lynch will address her upcoming title defense at Evolution, while Roxanne Perez will battle Kairi Sane as she looks to inflict punishment on Sane, whom she holds responsible for Liv Morgan's injury. Furthermore, the Trifecta of Terror will be in action as Seth Rollins is set to battle Penta, Bronson Reed is set to lock horns against Jey Uso, and Bron Breakker will square off against Sami Zayn. Let us now take a look at the top four potential spoilers that might be in store for fans. 4. Natalya & Maxxine Dupri advance One tag team from Raw, SmackDown, and NXT is set to compete in the fatal four-way match at Evolution, where Roxanne Perez and Raquel Rodriguez are set to defend their Women's Tag Team titles. Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss have already punched their ticket on last week's SmackDown. Natalya and Maxxine Dupri will likely secure their spot tonight as the two stars have developed great coordination and Natalya's experience, coupled with Dupri's agility, make them the favorites to secure the spot from the Raw brand. Also Read: WWE RAW (July 07, 2025): Preview, match card, news, timings & telecast details 3. Kairi Sane wins One-half of the WWE Women's Tag Team Champions, Roxanne Perez, has vowed vengeance after replacing Liv Morgan to join Raquel Rodriguez as the Tag Champions. Perez is looking to inflict punishment on Kairi Sane, whom she holds responsible for Morgan's injury. However, Perez, blinded by rage, could cost her the match. She will also need time to develop better coordination and teamwork with her new tag partner, Rodriguez, which might work against her if Raquel tries to interfere. 2. Becky Lynch's appearance ends in chaos As announced by General Manager Adam Peacre, Women's Intercontinental Champion Becky Lynch will defend the title in a triple-threat match against Bayley and Lyra Valkyria. Lynch is set to make an appearance on the show to address the upcoming title defense. However, the animosity between the three women might lead the segment to end in chaos, as was the case between Lyra and Bayley last week. The three women might engage in a brawl to build up hype for their upcoming clash. 1. LA Knight interferes Penta, for the first time ever, will battle Seth Rollins in a singles match. Penta and Sami Zayn spoiled the party for Rollins at Money in the Bank when he tried to cash in, and now they are again challenging Rollins' reign of terror. This match comes in the backdrop of Rollins' upcoming clash against LA Knight at the upcoming Saturday Night's Main Event. Knight ambushed Rollins on last week's show and he might do it again, punishing Rollins for the multiple attacks that forced him out of action. FAQs When and where is this week's Raw airing? The June 7 episode of Monday Night Raw will air live from the Amica Mutual Pavilion in Providence, Rhode Island, starting at 8 PM ET (US) on Netflix. What happened to Liv Morgan? Liv Morgan dislocated her shoulder during the June 16th edition of Monday Night Raw in a match against Kairi Sane. When and where will Evolution and SNME take place? WWE Evolution 2025 is scheduled for Sunday, July 13, 2025. The event will be held at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia. The July edition of WWE Saturday Night's Main Event will take place on Saturday, July 12, 2025, from the same venue."
mov_DBBFF2092BEE41E47E66B2DDC4521FF9,2025-07-07 09:53:13,en,WEB,"  Christian Lachapelle-Miller is struggling to find a safe, affordable place to live in Providence. (Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current) I'm a 31-year-old single professional, born and raised in Providence. Having spent more than half of my life shifting through foster care, I now work full-time for the State of Rhode Island and have over a decade of human and public service experience. And yet, despite my steady income and deep roots in this community, I find myself increasingly concerned about my housing stability. I'm struggling to find a safe, affordable place to live in the city I've always called home. A part of the housing crisis we don't talk about enough is the growing number of middle-income Rhode Islanders who are falling through the cracks. People like me — earning between $65,000 and $75,000 a year — are often excluded from affordable housing programs and don't qualify for most public assistance. But the private market is simply out of reach. I earn approximately $73,500 annually. After taxes, health care premiums, retirement contributions, and other deductions, my take-home pay is just under $4,200 a month. I live in a 400 square-foot studio because a modest two-bedroom apartment in Providence easily costs over $2,000 a month. That's nearly half my income — far above the recommended 30% threshold for housing affordability. And it's not just the rent. It's the rising cost of groceries, utilities, transportation, and student loan payments. For regular wage earners like me, the math simply doesn't add up. We are trapped in what many call the “missing middle” — making too much to qualify for help, yet not enough to afford a basic standard of living in the city we serve. My housing challenges are made even more difficult by a limited rental history. I lived in on-campus housing while attending Rhode Island College, followed by years of unstable or temporary living arrangements after I ran out of Federal Student Aid. This reality, coupled with a credit score that has been a consistent work in progress, creates significant barriers to accessing quality housing — barriers that are often invisible in policy frameworks but deeply felt in practice. This isn't just a personal hardship — it's a structural failure. Middle-income workers like me are often invisible in housing policy conversations. But we're not a fringe case. We're the case managers, teachers, social workers, nonprofit staffers, and early-career nurses who are doing everything “right” and still getting left behind. If Rhode Island is serious about solving its housing crisis, we need to stop treating middle-income earners as if we don't need support. We need new strategies that include: Expanding income eligibility thresholds to serve people earning 80% to 120% of Area Median Income; Developing mixed-income housing models that reflect a broader range of lived experiences; Adjusting credit and rental history requirements to account for the realities of those who've experienced systemic barriers; Drafting a robust statewide housing plan — including a separate, targeted strategy to prevent homelessness. Middle-income workers like me are often invisible in housing policy conversations. But we're not a fringe case. We're the case managers, teachers, social workers, nonprofit staffers, and early-career nurses who are doing everything “right” and still getting left behind. Housing is a human right — and one that must be extended to more than just those at the extremes of need. As a full-time public employee, I contribute daily to the well-being of my neighbors, and yet I'm on the verge of being priced out of the very community I serve. The fear of living in my car is not distant or dramatic — it's real and immediate. This isn't a theoretical problem. It's happening right now, to people you work with, rely on, and care for. Rhode Island's housing crisis isn't just about poverty — it's about the collapse of affordability across the entire working class. We need housing policies and solutions that reflect the full range of our economic realities. I share my story not to ask for pity, but to demand action — because this problem isn't mine alone. It belongs to all of us. If we want to build a just and livable Rhode Island, we must ensure that housing honors the full spectrum of the people who live and work here.

mov_EB8E780A14BBD050001CA4D2A73BDD90,2025-07-07 11:30:57,en,WEB,"  Justin Bieber appears to have dismissed rumours about his marriage to Hailey Bieber with a simple message. The relationship between the 31-year-old singer and his 28-year-old wife has been subject to plenty of speculation and reports in recent weeks with rumours of a breakup. However, Justin looks to have shrugged off any suggestion of a split with a four-word post on Instagram. Justin shared a series of sunset snaps with his wife on Sunday as they relaxed on a balcony together. Although Hailey's face could only be partially be seen in the photos – one them just showed the back of her head – Justin was clear in the caption. He wrote: 'My forever n always.' Justin and Hailey first met in 2009 and started dating six years later, and the rekindled their one/off romance in 2018 following his split from Selena Gomez. The couple welcomed their first son Jack into the world last August. Fans have been speculating about Justin's wellbeing for months after some erratic behaviour on social media. At the beginning of the year, he unfollowed the Rhode Beauty founder on Instagram, but refollowed her the same morning and claimed: 'Someone went on my account and unfollowed my wide.' A couple of months later, Hailey unfollowed the Love Yourself hitmaker for a couple of days, which she insisted was 'a glitch'. There have been reports that she has has become 'really concerned' about his behaviour', while in April her husband shared a lengthy and rambling post about people being 'jealous' of their marriage. The following month, Justin left his fans baffled after he revealed a fight they once had to commemorate her first Vogue magazine cover. He wrote of how he once told her during a 'huge fight' that . ' Yikes, I know, so mean,' he reflected, adding: 'So baby u already know but forgive me for saying u wouldn't get a vogue cover cuz clearly i was sadly mistaken. (sic)' He later deleted the post, while he has continued to leave fans confused by his social media activity. Last month, he suggested love shouldn't be conditional as he hit out at 'transactional relationships', while he later opened up and 'anger issues' and called himself 'broken' in an emotional statement. Hailey has since been seen without her wedding, ring, although days later she dismissed the rumours with a mirror selfie showing her ring on her hand.

mov_A682F7A85646715E3D3990527182B023,2025-07-07 12:13:26,en,WEB,"  Matt Light was one of the best offensive linemen to ever suit up for the New England Patriots and played a key role in building their first dynasty. A three-time Pro Bowler, Light was all business on the field—but off it, he was a jokester, party guy, and outdoorsman who loved hunting and pulling off harmless pranks. Despite the serious nature of the Super Bowl, Light couldn't resist the urge to have a little fun. He played in four of them and won three, yet even during the biggest games of his career, he had mischief on his mind. As he revealed on an episode of Games with Names, he used to steal Super Bowl memorabilia—banners from stadiums, hotel decorations, and anything he could get his hands on. “I couldn't help myself,” he admitted. The souvenirs were his own personal collection of prank trophies. “Is there a statute of limitations? I'm not going to jail on your podcast. Some of my favorite stuff that I have hanging now, and we just moved to Chapachid, Rhode Island, and in the move, I found some stuff I ganked from Super Bowls. I would rip down all these banners. I remember just jumping up and running, wadding it up and throwing it. When I got to the hotel, I couldn't stop myself there either. They be hanging high on a big atrium and I'd find my way up in there.” But the hijinks weren't limited to the Super Bowl stage. During his time with the Patriots, no one was safe from Light's antics—not teammates, not coaches, and not even team owner Robert Kraft. One of his most legendary pranks targeted Bill Belichick himself. Light once swapped the coach's regular computer mouse with a shocking one—the kind that delivers a jolt when clicked. Belichick was furious and, in classic fashion, took it out on the entire team with an extra-tough training camp. He stayed mad at Light for a month, forcing the lineman to make up for it by running extra drills at practice. Even Tom Brady wasn't spared. Light once filled Brady's car entirely with packing peanuts. Unfortunately for Light, he didn't get the reaction he was hoping for, because instead of cleaning it up himself, Brady just paid stadium staff to take care of it. Light also had a long-running prank going with Patriots offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia. He replaced the coach's mouse with one that had a timer programmed to randomly move the cursor in the wrong direction. The prank lasted 10 weeks. Every time Scarnecchia grew frustrated and went to call IT, Light would sneak in and switch the faulty mouse with a normal one. The coach started thinking the IT department was either incompetent or messing with him on purpose. He was genuinely losing his mind. Matt Light might have been a serious contributor to the Patriots' success, but off the field, he brought a different kind of energy—one filled with humor, mischief, and legendary pranks that his teammates will never forget. The post appeared first on The SportsRush ."

mov_4BB33C2E86D5D82134965CDD00148443,2025-07-07 12:45:10,en,WEB,"  In late June, a source alleged that Hailey “has been frustrated by Justin's antics on Instagram.” In the past few months, there's been a lot of chatter about Justin Bieber's well-being, and with that has come plenty of speculation about his marriage to Hailey Bieber. To summarize, Justin has been very active on social media this year, often venting to his followers on Instagram about fame, work, and life. Notably, a number of his cryptic IG posts have made reference to love and relationships, which, of course, have had fans wondering if everything is OK between him and Hailey. Since they tied the knot in 2018, the Biebers — who share a soon-to-be one-year-old son, Jack Blues — have struggled to avoid divorce speculation. However, the breakup chatter reached new heights in March when Justin made some strange comments on Hailey's first Mother's Day, and things then ramped up again in May when he shared a bizarre reaction to her solo Vogue cover. If you missed it, Justin marked Hailey's milestone Vogue cover by rehashing a “huge fight” they'd had where he previously told her “she would never be on the cover of vogue.” As for the Mother's Day comments, JB marked the special day by proclaiming on IG story that “mothers day sucks ass.” In mid-June, Hailey was spotted on a couple of occasions without her engagement ring. And though she soon had it back on again, a source told Entertainment Tonight on June 26 that “things have been rocky” between the couple and that Hailey “has been frustrated by Justin's antics on Instagram.” “Justin has been super moody, and they've had a lot of unpleasant conversations and arguments,” the source claimed, saying that Hailey feels “unsupported” by her husband and “drained” by “fights about simple things like what they're having for dinner.” “Justin has been getting irritated easily and feels like Hailey can be superficial about the way their relationship looks in the public eye.” As it stands, neither Justin nor Hailey has publicly addressed the reports about their “rocky” marriage. Although, if his latest Instagram post is anything to go by, it looks like JB has a message for the doubters. On Sunday, the 31-year-old — who, in case you missed it, recently changed his Instagram handle from @justinbieber to @lilbieber — posted a series of photos showing himself and Hailey hugging in front of a sunset with beaming smiles on their faces. He captioned it: “My forever n always ,” and Hailey liked the post in return. Well, that seems like a pretty clear message about where JB and Hailey are at, and it also echoes the Rhode founder's previous comments to Vogue about how most of the rumors about her private life are “not real.” “That's the thing,” she told the outlet in her cover May interview. “I have a real life. My real life is that I get to wake up to my beautiful family and my son and my friends and I have people that know me and love me and I love them.” In the same interview, Justin said that marrying Hailey was “the smartest thing” he'd ever done. So, there you have it! More on this"

Susanne Schindler, Harvard Kennedy School (THE CONVERSATION) Seattle astounded housing advocates around the country in February 2025, when roughly two-thirds of voters approved a ballot initiative proposing a new 5% payroll tax on salaries in excess of US$1 million. The expected revenue – estimated to amount to $52 million dollars annually – would go toward funding a public development authority named Seattle Social Housing, which would then build and maintain permanently affordable homes. The city has experienced record high rents and home prices over the past two decades, attributed in part to the high incomes and relatively low taxes paid by tech firms like Amazon. Prior attempts to make these companies do their part to keep the city affordable have had mixed results. So despite nationwide, bipartisan skepticism of government and tax increases, Seattle's voters showed that in light of a severe affordability crisis, a new role for the public sector and a new, dedicated fiscal revenue stream for housing were not only necessary, but possible. As a trained architect and urban historian, I study how capitalist societies have embraced – or rejected – housing that's permanently shielded from market forces and what that means for architecture and urban design. To me, Seattle's social housing initiative shows that the country's traditional, “either-or” housing model – of unregulated, market-rate housing versus tightly regulated, income-restricted affordable housing – has reached its limits. Social housing promises a different path forward. After World War I, amid a similarly dire housing crisis, journalist Catherine Bauer traveled to Europe and learned about the continent's social housing programs. She publicized her findings in the 1934 book “Modern Housing,” in which she advocated for housing that would be permanently shielded from the private real estate market. High-quality design was central to her argument. (The book was reissued in 2020, reflecting a renewed hunger for her ideas.) Early New Deal programs supported “limited-dividend,” or nonprofit, housing sponsored by civic organizations such as labor unions. The Carl Mackley Houses in Philadelphia exemplified this approach: The government provided low-interest loans to the American Federation of Full-Fashioned Hosiery Workers, which then constructed housing for its workers with rents set at affordable rates. The complex was built with community rooms and a swimming pool for its residents. However, the 1937 U.S. Housing Act omitted this form of middle-income housing. Instead, the federal government chose to support public rental housing for low-income Americans and private homeownership, with little in between. Historian Gail Radford has aptly termed this a “two-tiered system,” and it was problematic from the start. Funding for public housing in the U.S. – as well as for its successor, private-sector-built affordable housing – has always been capped in ways that fall far short of demand, with access to the homes largely restricted to households with the lowest incomes. Private-sector-built affordable housing depends on dangling tax credits for private investors, and rent restrictions can expire. While the U.S. promoted this two-tiered system, cities like Vienna pursued a different path. In Austria's culturally vibrant capital, today half of all dwellings are permanently removed from the private market. Roughly 80% of households qualify to live in them. The buildings take a range of forms, are located in all neighborhoods, and are built and operated as rental or cooperative housing either by the city or by nonprofit developers. Rents do not rise and fall according to household income, but are instead set to cover capital and operation expenses. These are kept low thanks to long-term, low-interest loans. These loans are funded through a nationwide 1% payroll tax, split evenly between employers and employees. Renters also make a down payment, priced in relation to the size and age of the apartment, which keeps monthly rents down. To guarantee access to low-cost land, the municipality has pursued an active land acquisition policy since the 1980s. The inequities created by the two-tiered system – along with the absence of viable options for moderate- and middle-income households – are what social housing advocates in the U.S. are trying to address today. In 2018, the think tank People's Policy Project published what was likely the first 21st-century report advocating for social housing in the U.S., citing Vienna as a model. Across the U.S., social housing is being used to describe a range of programs, from limited equity cooperatives and community land trusts to public housing. They all share a few underlying principles, however. First and foremost, social housing calls for permanently shielding homes from the private real estate market, often referred to as “permanent affordability.” This usually means public investment in housing and public ownership of it. Second, unlike the ways in which public housing has traditionally operated in the U.S., most social housing programs aim to serve households across a broader range of incomes. The goal is to create housing that is both financially sustainable and appealing to broad swaths of the electorate. Third, social housing aspires to give residents more control over the governance of their homes. Social housing doesn't all look the same. But thoughtful design is key to its success. It's built to be owned and operated in the long-term, not for short-term financial gain. Construction quality matters, and developers realize it needs to be appealing to a range of tenants with different needs. In recent years, there have been significant wins for the social housing movement at the state and local levels. In 2023, Atlanta created a new quasi-public entity to co-develop mixed-income housing on city-owned land. In 2024, Rhode Island voters and the Massachusetts legislature funded pilot projects to test public investment in social housing. And 2025 has seen the the passage of Chicago's Green Social Housing ordinance. Many of these programs were directly inspired by affordable housing initiatives in Montgomery County, Maryland. Since 2021, the county's housing authority has used a $100 million housing fund to invest in new mixed-income developments...."

Much of its impact comes from the dense, claustrophobic forests of Montgomery County's Seneca State Park, where the film was shot.

mov_62CE5D64D452FA422FF33A6192EFBCB2,2025-07-07 13:39:27,en,WEB,"  Phylicia Rashad joins the cast of season 3 in episode 3, titled , and her character will shake things up for one of the show's heroines. The third episode of the season, which premiered on Max on Sunday evening, July 6, 2025, introduced the six-time Emmy-nominated actress' character as Dr. William Kirkland's (Jordan Donica) mother, Elizabeth. While everyone in Newport appears hopeful about Peggy's budding romance with Dr. Kirkland, at least at first, Elizabeth isn't. She's a conundrum because while she's initially impressed by Peggy's level of education, she feels disdain over Peggy's father being a former slave, despite becoming a businessman since then. Racism has been a sore spot for the Scotts to the point that they were shocked when the Van Rhijns treated them with respect. With Phylicia Rashad's character turning her nose against them, she's going to be an obstacle in Peggy's story. Find out more about her character below. Who is Elizabeth Kirkland? All about Phylicia Rashad's character in season 3 season 3 episode 3 introduces Phylicia Rashad as Elizabeth Kirkland in Peggy Scott's story. She's the mother of Dr. William Kirkland, the doctor whom Peggy's parents brought with them to treat Peggy at the Van Rhijn's in season 3 episode 2. Elizabeth is a proud woman and takes immense pride in her family's roots, turning her nose up at those who come from a lesser background. In episode 3, she proudly states that her family has lived in Rhode Island for five generations. She also takes pride in the fact that her great-great-grandfather fought in the American Revolutionary War. She has an inflated sense of self-importance because, as her husband points out, her ancestor only ""played the bugle"" in the war and not one of the soldiers who fought on the frontlines. Elizabeth further displays her snobby behavior after learning that Peggy's father was once a slave. Although she doesn't say it in many words, her character comes off as snobbish and judgmental, despite Arthur Scott turning his life around from being a former slave to becoming a businessman. After the party where the Scotts met the Kirklands, Arthur says Elizabeth Kirkland was a ""piece of work."" Read more: What role does Victoria Clark play in The Gilded Age season 3? The significance of Phylicia Rashad's character in season 3 In a post-episode interview of the show's co-showrunner, Sonja Warfield, with TV Line, she explained the significance of adding Phylicia Rashad's Elizabeth Kirkland to the series. She said that they have always wanted to add storylines about the divide between the elites and the middle class in the Black community during the time period depicted in the show. These storylines, per Warfield, are not usually depicted in shows as they often focus on slavery and sharecropping. However, she said that the Black elite and the Black middle class ""did exist,"" and they wanted to put them on the screen to depict the ""internalized racism and colorism"" between those two classes. Series creator Julian Fellowes added: ""It's important to remember that every community has its own snobberies, its own separations, its own divisions."" Phylicia Rashad's Elizabeth Kirkland in season 3 episode 3 is the epitome of that snobbery and divide. Because, according to Fellowes, to believe that there's one community that doesn't have that kind of division is a ""myth.""

Email tips@dailymail.com Fans are speculating that Olivia Culpo is expecting twins following a recent cryptic bikini post. The former Miss Universe, 33, shared a carousel of images from her Fourth of July celebrations that showed off her bare bump in a red bikini while cozying up to her NFL player husband Christian McCaffrey, 29. But it was her caption that caught the attention of fans, sparking theories that the couple are expecting more than one bundle of joy. 'Buns in the oven, burgers on the grill ❤️ happy 4th love you all ❤️❤️❤️❤️,' Olivia — who enjoyed a lavish baby shower — wrote on her post. 'Buns? As in plural?' one person questioned, as another wrote, 'I think she's having twins!' 'Omggg i just realized it might be twinssss,' someone else chimed in. 'I have been thinking it's twins for the longest time for you guys,' another wrote. 'Having more than one?' someone else inquired. 'Buns as in plural babies? Or did you mean bun's (bun is)?' '“Buns” must be twins … how exciting!' another added. Olivia didn't let her growing baby bump get in the way or her enjoyment as she donned a red bikini and white pants while celebrating the holiday with friends and family. She shared a selection of photos on Instagram, including a sweet one with the NFL San Francisco 49ers star as they cozied up in their backyard just as the sun was setting. Olivia leaned into her shirtless husband, who tenderly placed his hand on her far-along bump. In the second photo, the mom to be relaxed in a lounge chair in the red bikini top with a white linen jacket, a backwards red ball cap and oval lensed sunglasses. She also shared video clips of the men playing volleyball, two young girls cuddling with a goat, and of her cute dog enjoying the festivities. In March, Olivia and Christian announced they were expecting their first child together and that Olivia was already six months pregnant. She shared several stunning black-and-white snaps of herself caressing her bump on social media as she announced to her followers: 'Next chapter, motherhood.' The couple, who have been dating since 2019 and tied the knot last summer in a lavish ceremony in Rhode Island, are yet to announce the gender of the baby. Christian is the star running back for the San Francisco 49ers, while Olivia is an actress, model and former pageant star. She has been open about her desire to start a family with Christian before but has also discussed her battle with Endometriosis. During a 2022 episode of the reality show Culpo Sisters, she said: 'I want to have kids, but I want to make sure that I can. It could be really hard for me to have babies.' She continued: 'Endometriosis can affect your fertility in a lot of different ways. 'You can have endometrial tissue growing near or on your ovaries, it can affect the quality of your eggs, scar your fallopian tubes. 'There is so much that I don't know about what's going to happen in the future with that condition, and I worry all the time about my timeline. I feel like I have to have kids ASAP.' The pregnancy is great news for Christian after a torrid NFL season that saw him suffer a number of injury setbacks. Christian, who signed a two-year, $38million contract extension in June 2024, played in just four games last season. And Olivia isn't sitting around during her pregnancy. She's still doing intense gym workouts. In May, she took to her Instagram stories on Thursday to share a look into her fitness routine as an expectant mom. In text added towards the bottom of the picture, the media personality penned to her 5.4 million followers: 'working out here looks different these days @petermollofitness.' Peter Mollo Fitness is a gym that is located in Rhode Island ≠ and offers both classes as well as training. The star also uploaded a short reel as she worked out her legs on a machine as music played in the background. Lastly, Culpo posed for another mirror selfie with pal and photographer Lucio Andreozzi who had accompanied the model to the gym. Olivia announced that she is pregnant March 10 and took to Instagram to give her fans a first look at her baby bump. The media personality posed in black and white photos while wearing a sleeveless, maxi dress that elegantly flowed around her. Culpo also uploaded a sweet video while joined by McCaffrey to give a behind-the-scenes look at a maternity photo shoot that they did outdoors."

The talk show returned from the July 4 weekend to the tune of an audience who maybe could've used an extra day of rest from the holiday stretch, as one particular studio attendee showed her disapproval for the cohosts' conversation during the broadcast. After Consuelos brought up a talking point about walkable cities and a recent survey that hailed Philadelphia as the nation's best for walking, Ripa pushed back against the result. ""What? I mean, I'm a big walker in Philly. I'm from south Jersey, so I know the area well, but I'd say it's less of a walking city than New York,"" Ripa observed. ""It's not a grid. It's all over the place."" Consuelos continued with the list, with cities in Rhode Island (Providence), Vermont (Burlington), and Ohio (Columbus) finishing out the list. As Consuelos spoke about the city of Columbus, the audience could be heard clapping in the background. ""Really? Really? You know what I think is a nice, walkable city? Ann Arbor,"" Consuelos said. ""Not Columbus, Ohio."" Ripa then looked off-screen toward the audience and asked, ""Did you just give us the thumbs down, lady? What are you, from Ohio?"" The audience member then yelled, ""Columbus!"" before the hosts moved on, indicating that their beloved New York City landed at No. 10 on the list. ""I like cities where you can walk,"" Ripa said, finishing the segment. ""Listen, I walk around Los Angeles. It's a weird experience, because to me it's such a walkable city, and yet nobody walks there. So, you have to ask yourself, why is nobody walking?"" Monday's moment came days after Ripa called out another audience member last week. During a discussion about younger generations using artificial intelligence to do everyday things, Ripa and Consuelos singled out a young audience member who admitted to using AI to help her end a romantic relationship.

Susanne Schindler, Harvard Kennedy School (THE CONVERSATION) Seattle astounded housing advocates around the country in February 2025, when roughly two-thirds of voters approved a ballot initiative proposing a new 5% payroll tax on salaries in excess of US$1 million. The expected revenue – estimated to amount to $52 million dollars annually – would go toward funding a public development authority named Seattle Social Housing, which would then build and maintain permanently affordable homes. The city has experienced record high rents and home prices over the past two decades, attributed in part to the high incomes and relatively low taxes paid by tech firms like Amazon. Prior attempts to make these companies do their part to keep the city affordable have had mixed results. So despite nationwide, bipartisan skepticism of government and tax increases, Seattle's voters showed that in light of a severe affordability crisis, a new role for the public sector and a new, dedicated fiscal revenue stream for housing were not only necessary, but possible. As a trained architect and urban historian, I study how capitalist societies have embraced – or rejected – housing that's permanently shielded from market forces and what that means for architecture and urban design. To me, Seattle's social housing initiative shows that the country's traditional, “either-or” housing model – of unregulated, market-rate housing versus tightly regulated, income-restricted affordable housing – has reached its limits. Social housing promises a different path forward. The rise of the 'two-tiered' system After World War I, amid a similarly dire housing crisis, journalist Catherine Bauer traveled to Europe and learned about the continent's social housing programs. She publicized her findings in the 1934 book “Modern Housing,” in which she advocated for housing that would be permanently shielded from the private real estate market. High-quality design was central to her argument. (The book was reissued in 2020, reflecting a renewed hunger for her ideas.) Early New Deal programs supported “limited-dividend,” or nonprofit, housing sponsored by civic organizations such as labor unions. The Carl Mackley Houses in Philadelphia exemplified this approach: The government provided low-interest loans to the American Federation of Full-Fashioned Hosiery Workers, which then constructed housing for its workers with rents set at affordable rates. The complex was built with community rooms and a swimming pool for its residents. However, the 1937 U.S. Housing Act omitted this form of middle-income housing. Instead, the federal government chose to support public rental housing for low-income Americans and private homeownership, with little in between. Historian Gail Radford has aptly termed this a “two-tiered system,” and it was problematic from the start. Funding for public housing in the U.S. – as well as for its successor, private-sector-built affordable housing – has always been capped in ways that fall far short of demand, with access to the homes largely restricted to households with the lowest incomes. Private-sector-built affordable housing depends on dangling tax credits for private investors, and rent restrictions can expire. While the U.S. promoted this two-tiered system, cities like Vienna pursued a different path. In Austria's culturally vibrant capital, today half of all dwellings are permanently removed from the private market. Roughly 80% of households qualify to live in them. The buildings take a range of forms, are located in all neighborhoods, and are built and operated as rental or cooperative housing either by the city or by nonprofit developers. Rents do not rise and fall according to household income, but are instead set to cover capital and operation expenses. These are kept low thanks to long-term, low-interest loans. These loans are funded through a nationwide 1% payroll tax, split evenly between employers and employees. Renters also make a down payment, priced in relation to the size and age of the apartment, which keeps monthly rents down. To guarantee access to low-cost land, the municipality has pursued an active land acquisition policy since the 1980s. Housing shielded from the private market The inequities created by the two-tiered system – along with the absence of viable options for moderate- and middle-income households – are what social housing advocates in the U.S. are trying to address today. In 2018, the think tank People's Policy Project published what was likely the first 21st-century report advocating for social housing in the U.S., citing Vienna as a model. More from this section Across the U.S., social housing is being used to describe a range of programs, from limited equity cooperatives and community land trusts to public housing. They all share a few underlying principles, however. First and foremost, social housing calls for permanently shielding homes from the private real estate market, often referred to as “permanent affordability.” This usually means public investment in housing and public ownership of it. Second, unlike the ways in which public housing has traditionally operated in the U.S., most social housing programs aim to serve households across a broader range of incomes. The goal is to create housing that is both financially sustainable and appealing to broad swaths of the electorate. Third, social housing aspires to give residents more control over the governance of their homes. Social housing doesn't all look the same. But thoughtful design is key to its success. It's built to be owned and operated in the long-term, not for short-term financial gain. Construction quality matters, and developers realize it needs to be appealing to a range of tenants with different needs. Early successes In recent years, there have been significant wins for the social housing movement at the state and local levels. In 2023, Atlanta created a new quasi-public entity to co-develop mixed-income housing on city-owned land...."

Here's when Prime Day 2025 is, what it is and how long it lasts. Amazon's huge annual summer sale slashes prices on a wide variety of items, from clothes and accessories to crafting tools, home decor and electronics. And Prime Day 2025 will last for two days longer than it has in past years. Amazon Prime Day is an online shopping event for Amazon Prime members that the company started in 2015, to celebrate its 20th anniversary. Prime Day has since exploded in popularity and will include four days of deals this year. It started as just one day and expanded into a 24-hour sale in 2017 and a 36-hour sale in 2018. While not every item on Amazon's platform is eligible for Prime Day deals, Prime members can find deals on a wide array of brands and products. To participate in most of Amazon's Prime Day deals, you need to have an Amazon Prime account. A standard Prime membership costs $14.99 per month or $139 for a one-year subscription. There are also two discounted membership options: Amazon Prime Day started as a single day in July 2015 and has since grown into an annual multi-day shopping event for Prime members. This year is the first time the promotion will last for four days. Amazon Prime Day 2025 deals will begin on Tuesday, July 8, and end on Friday, July 11. Prime Day only happens once each year, in the summer. But in recent years, Amazon added a similar sales event in October to kick off early holiday shopping, called Prime Big Deal Days. If Amazon stays consistent with the last few years and holds the promotion on the second Tuesday and Wednesday of October, Prime Big Deal Days 2025 will likely land on Tuesday, October 14 and Wednesday, October 15. Not everything on Amazon is on sale for Prime Day. The annual discount days have discounts for Prime members across almost every product category, but it isn't a site-wide sale.

Courtesy/LANL LANL News: After serving in the same vessel, they are now immersed in mission-critical work In the depths of the Atlantic Ocean, three Navy officers once patrolled the seas aboard Ohio-class submarines, ready to deploy the nation's ultimate strategic deterrent should the order ever come. Years later, those same men — Ted Fan, Andy Felton and Will Graves — find themselves on land but still immersed in mission-critical work. This time, their theater of operation is the Laboratory. The connection is more than symbolic. Fan, Felton and Graves all served in Submarine Squadron 20 out of Kings Bay, Ga., and today, they work side by side at the Lab. What were the odds? “I knew Will pretty well due to our time on the submarine from 2017-2019, and met Ted when I got here,” said Felton, who was the first to make the jump to the Lab in 2021 after leaving the Navy. “But through the tight-knit submarine officer network and the Lab's recruiting efforts, we found our way back into the same orbit — literally the same group at the Lab.” A shared legacy below the surface In the Navy, the three served aboard ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) — the stealthy giants of America's nuclear triad. Felton and Graves both spent time on the USS Tennessee; Fan served aboard the USS Rhode Island. Each was part of a Blue or Gold crew, the dual-rotation system that keeps these subs mission-ready at all times. All three served as junior officers — leaders trained to wear many hats. Each managed a division of about 10 sailors, supervised the nuclear propulsion system and took shifts driving the submarine as officer of the deck. They were also part of the Emergency Action Team, entrusted with executing presidential launch orders if ever called upon. It was high-stakes, high-discipline work — experience that translates seamlessly to the mission at the Lab today. “We were the ones who would execute the war plan if the message came,” Graves said. “We'd validate presidential communications, break the codes and be responsible for launching nuclear weapons. That was the reality of our jobs. Now, at the Lab, we're on the other side of that mission — helping to ensure deterrence by supporting the manufacture of pits.” It's a transition that reflects not just skill, but purpose. From submarines to plutonium Today, all three veterans serve as first-line managers in the Lab's Plutonium Facility — Graves and Fan work with the product engineers and Felton works with the tooling and equipment designers. “At first glance, we don't fit the typical mold,” Fan admitted. “We don't come with manufacturing experience, but what we do have is high-consequence operational experience. We're used to solving complex technical problems in highly regulated nuclear environments. PT took a chance on us, and we're grateful.” Their leadership style reflects their Navy roots: small-team management, technical precision and unwavering accountability. It's a seamless fit in the Plutonium Facility. “We trained in nuclear safety and operations, and now we build for that same strategic mission,” Fan said. “That continuity matters.” A culture that values veterans The story of these three veterans isn't just a quirky coincidence — it's a powerful testament to how the Lab values military experience, especially in mission-aligned roles. “When it comes to national security, these career paths are a natural fit,” said Mark Davis, a former Navy submarine commander and deputy Laboratory director for Operations. “As a veteran myself, I'm proud of the way LANL welcomes and empowers those who've served. It's an honor to support their careers and work alongside them in continuing the mission — just in a different form.” “As veterans, we truly understand the value of the military experience. It is great to see the Laboratory embrace what veterans are able to contribute to the Lab's mission,” said Warren Mazanec, the co-chair of the Lab's Veterans Employee Resource Group and one of three generations of Navy nuclear engineers. The Lab's recruiting efforts, including targeted veteran hiring events and outreach at service academies, are yielding results. Michelle Mazanec, the Lab's military recruiter, points to the strong partnerships forged through military networks, including the Nuclear Power Officer Career Conference and the Veterans Employee Resource Group. “The submarine community is small but deeply connected,” she said. “LANL is becoming known as a place where those skills and values are not just appreciated — they're needed.” For Fan, Felton and Graves, that shared sense of purpose — once forged in the confines of a nuclear submarine — now resonates in the hills of Northern New Mexico. “I never thought I'd end up in a place like LANL,” Felton reflected. “There's a whole technical side that fits exactly with our background.” Graves agreed...."

On Sunday, July 6, the pop star, 31, shared an filled with romantic photos featuring the Rhode founder, 28. In the sweet snaps, the couple sit on a bench and hold each other closely in front of a sunset as he smiles. “My forever n always ,” Justin captioned his post. Justin and Hailey — who share 10-month-old son Jack Blues — have been dealing with rumors about the state of their marriage for months, with many fans expressing concern about Justin's well-being. On June 12, Justin made headlines after he confronted paparazzi outside Soho House in Malibu. He's also been on a major posting spree on social media recently — and in a June 16 , he called himself “broken” and admitted to having “anger issues.” A source told Star last month that Hailey was “emotionally exhausted” by her hubby's “ongoing stretch of erratic behavior.” The source claimed that Hailey “has begged Justin to take some space,” adding, “She's clear that it's not a step toward divorce, but just time to regroup somewhere private. If not rehab, somewhere he can go to focus on wellness and self-care.” “Hailey's made it clear that without some kind of break, she doesn't know how much longer she and Justin can keep going,” the source added. MEGA In her May Vogue cover, Hailey addressed the public's obsession with her marriage to Justin, who she wed in 2018. “Well, I thought seven years in it would've already [died down], and it hasn't,” she told the outlet at the time. “You would think after having a child, people would maybe move on, chill out a little bit, but no.” “I have a real life,” she continued. “My real life is that I get to wake up to my beautiful family and my son and my friends and I have people that know me and love me and I love them.” More in Celebrity However, after the Vogue cover was published, Justin shared a photo of it on his Instagram and detailed a “huge fight” between him and Hailey in which he told her “she would never be on the cover of Vogue” in his caption. He later changed the caption to read “” — leading fans to believe there may have been tension between the two following his initial post."
n1u4kkr,2025-07-07 16:56:40,en,REDDIT,"  Fun beach read kind of book. Copied this description from Goodreads propulsive and uncommonly wise novel about one unexpected wedding guest and the surprising people who help her start anew. It's a beautiful day in Newport, Rhode Island, when Phoebe Stone arrives at the grand Cornwall Inn wearing a green dress and gold heels, not a bag in sight, alone. She's immediately mistaken by everyone in the lobby for one of the wedding people, but she's actually the only guest at the Cornwall who isn't here for the big event. Phoebe is here because she's dreamed of coming for years―she hoped to shuck oysters and take sunset sails with her husband, only now she's here without him, at rock bottom, and determined to have one last decadent splurge on herself. Meanwhile, the bride has accounted for every detail and every possible disaster the weekend might yield except for, well, Phoebe and Phoebe's plan―which makes it that much more surprising when the two women can't stop confiding in each other. In turns absurdly funny and devastatingly tender, Alison Espach's The Wedding People is ultimately an incredibly nuanced and resonant look at the winding paths we can take to places we never imagined―and the chance encounters it sometimes takes to reroute us. Finished it in 2 days on vacation."

When confronted by Ripa, the woman smiled and confirmed that she's a resident of the Buckeye capital. The conversation moved on with Ripa and Consuelos both amazed that New York City placed a lowly ten on the list. ""I like cities where you can walk. Listen, I walk around Los Angeles. It's a weird experience, because to me it's such a walkable city, and yet nobody walks there. So, you have to ask yourself, why is nobody walking?""

When a playful 9-month-old Labrador named Mort paused mid-fetch to fix a rug he'd accidentally kicked askew, his foster couldn't believe her eyes—and neither could the internet. Captured in a short clip that's since gone viral, Mort's charming sense of manners is just one of many reasons he's stealing hearts. Behind that sweet moment is a rescue story full of hope, second chances, and a pup ready for a forever home. A Viral Moment That Melted Hearts A Viral Moment That Melted Hearts. Source: Instagram / lasthopek9 Mort Moreland, a 9-month-old Labrador retriever mix, may look like your typical playful pup, but his charming manners and gentle spirit are anything but ordinary. A viral video shared by Last Hope K9 Rescue captured a heart-melting moment: Mort was chasing a ball when he slid across the floor and accidentally pushed the rug askew. Instead of bounding ahead, the pup paused, nudged the rug neatly back into place, and only then resumed playing. “Did the foster puppy just… fix the rug?” the caption read—and the internet couldn't get enough. The Pup with a Heart (and Manners) of Gold Mort was rescued from rural Arkansas, where he had likely known a life of uncertainty. After being fostered in the South, he was transported to Massachusetts in the hopes of finding a forever home. His foster carer couldn't believe it when the video captured Mort's courteous rug moment. Amanda Dunn of Last Hope K9 Rescue told Newsweek, “It wasn't a trained behavior. It was just Mort being Mort.” Despite his young age, Mort exhibits a calm, easygoing temperament. He gets along wonderfully with other dogs, cats, and even dog-savvy children. He's playful but never overwhelming, affectionate without being clingy—an ideal companion for families or individuals looking for a balance of fun and peace. From Shelter Statistics to Second Chances From Shelter Statistics to Second Chances. Source: Instagram / lasthopek9 Mort's story is part of a much larger picture. In 2024 alone, U.S. shelters received over 7 million animals, with more entering than being adopted. Amid this shelter capacity crisis, Mort stands as a bright spot: a dog who's ready, willing, and patiently waiting for the love he's always deserved. The Perfect Match Is Just a Rug-Tidy Pup Away According to Dunn, Mort would thrive in a structured home that enjoys daily walks and cozy evenings. Whether he becomes a loyal sibling to other pets or the solo star of his new family, one thing is clear—Mort is the kind of dog who turns houses into homes. A Sweet Future Awaits A Sweet Future Awaits. Source: Instagram / lasthopek9 For those in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, Rhode Island, or Connecticut, Mort is more than adoptable—he's unforgettable. And maybe, just maybe, the next time you toss a ball, you'll look up to find your pup fixing the rug too. Just like Mort."

I've traced my line back to **Lord Jean de Vars**, born in 1620 in the Parish of St. Martin Sepert Per (possibly a mistranscription—if anyone recognizes the correct parish name, I'd love help clarifying it). He was my 9th great-grandfather. His son, **John de Vars**, was born in 1653 in the Limoges area of France. He traveled to Rhode Island, apparently liked what he saw, and returned to France to bring his wife **Mary** and their young son **Isaac**, born **1682**. On the return trip to the U.S., John de Vars was reportedly killed—either in a duel or murdered outright for his money. I can trace my ancestry clearly from John de Vars down to myself, but I've hit a wall with **his** ancestors in France. I'd love any insight into earlier generations of the de Vars family, or help confirming the story about what happened during the voyage. Thank you very much in advance!"

mov_03A5BBAF86CB62D6DE5AC0DAAF092545,2025-07-07 21:24:50,en,WEB,"  PROVIDENCE — Mayor Brett Smiley plans to appeal the decision of a panel of law enforcement officers to reinstate Sergeant Joseph Hanley to active duty on the Providence police force, five years after he kicked, punched, and berated a handcuffed man as he lay face down on a city sidewalk. Vincent Ragosta, the city's lawyer in the case, said he is planning to file the appeal in Rhode Island Superior Court this week. Smiley said Hanley's conduct fell “short of the high standards” expected of a Providence police officer, which is why he is appealing the decision. “The actions in question are not reflective of the professionalism and integrity that the department is meant to uphold and this decision could harm the trust in local law enforcement we have worked hard to build within our communities,” Smiley said. Hanley is currently scheduled to return to the police department on Sept. 3, spokesperson Josh Estrella said. The panel, which operated under the now-defunct Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights, ruled in a vote of 2 to 1 to allow Hanley to return the force after serving a 45-day suspension. He will also have to undergo some retraining. The police department had sought to fire him under two chiefs and two mayors over the past five years. But under state law, the decision was ultimately up to the hearing panel, which was made up of one officer selected by Hanley, one officer selected by the police department, and one selected jointly. The law has since been changed — and renamed — to include a new five-member panel, none of whom are selected by the accused. Hanley's was the final hearing under the old law. Cranston Police Major Todd Patalano, the chair of the panel, and retired Providence Sergeant Robert Boehm, who was Hanley's pick, voted in favor of restoring Hanley to the force after suspending him for violating the department's use-of-force policy. Providence Police Commander Timothy O'Hara, who will be Hanley's superior on the department when he returns, was the dissenting vote, writing in an opinion that Hanley is “a man prone to volatility, a man prone to violence, a man prone to vulgarity, a man prone to untruthfulness, and a man accustomed to lying.” Hanley pleaded no contest in December to a charge of assault in the 2020 incident on Tell Street, where he was captured on video repeatedly striking Rishod Gore and calling him an “animal,” “savage” and the “c” word. Gore was in handcuffs and lying prone on the sidewalk after being arrested for disorderly conduct. The charge was later dropped. At his first trial in 2021, Hanley was convicted of assault by a District Court judge, but he had a right to a trial by jury on appeal at the Superior Court level. That jury could not reach a unanimous decision, and a mistrial was declared last year. Hanley pleaded no contest, avoiding a third trial, and was sentenced to probation. The LEOBOR hearing then began, which is administrative in nature, not criminal, and takes place behind closed doors. The panelists were charged with determining whether Hanley violated any department policies and what his punishment should be. The panelists found that Hanley violated the use-of-force policy four separate times and also violated the body-worn camera policy (he didn't turn his on), but cleared him of other policy violations. Patalano and Boehm wrote that Hanley deserves a second chance because he “has maintained an unblemished and exemplary record of service, one that distinguishes him not only within the Providence Police Department but throughout the broader law enforcement community.” Ragosta said winning an appeal of an administrative decision is “very challenging,” since the LEOBOR panel is ultimately responsible for making the decision. The court will review whether procedures were properly followed. One issue the city will bring up in the appeal, Ragosta said, is the inclusion of Hanley's claim that Tom Verdi, the former Providence deputy chief, initially offered him a 45-day suspension, before then-Chief Hugh Clements formally sought his termination. Hanley's attorney said it was only after George Floyd was murdered by police in Minnesota in 2020 that Providence officials sought to fire Hanley, rather than suspend him. (Hanley was charged with assault before the Floyd murder.) The Verdi offer, “even if it was made, should not have been admitted into evidence,” Ragosta told the Globe. Verdi, who is now the state director of revenue, declined to comment on whether he ever offered Hanley a 45-day suspension. He said he was not asked to testify before the LEOBOR panel. The city and Hanley are also in disagreement about back pay, which would total nearly $465,000 in salary, holiday pay, longevity pay and clothing allowances from his unpaid suspension, which started in fall 2020. City lawyers argue Hanley is not owed any back pay, citing a 2021 ruling from Justice Alice Gibney. At the time, Hanley was asking the court to reinstate his pay as his criminal case made its way through the courts. State law allowed the police department to stop paying him six months into his suspension. Hanley argued that since his criminal trial was delayed because of the pandemic, his pay should be restored. But Gibney said Hanley's own legal maneuvers also contributed to the delay, and she allowed the unpaid suspension to continue. The LEOBOR statute says officers are owed back pay if they are acquitted, which Hanley was not. Hanley's lawyer, Michael Colucci, said last month he disagrees with the city's interpretation on the back pay. He has not yet filed any court action challenging it. Hanley reached 20 years on the force while suspended, which is the number of years required to retire with a maximum pension. If he puts in for retirement after being reinstated, the city could seek to challenge his pension. Colonel Oscar Perez, the current police chief, said last month he disagreed with the decision to return Hanley to his police force. “When we can't hold officers accountable, we put our community at risk and we lose the trust that we as a department work very hard to build,” Perez said."

His interest in music began at an early age when he studied piano and clarinet in high school. At Morehouse College in Atlanta where he grew up, he sang in the Glee Club and studied classical music. After graduation he went off to the Yale School of Music where he earned a Masters degree. From there he journeyed to New York where he created a jazz trio 'Au Naturel' which performed in some of the hottest venues in Manhattan including gigs on Broadway and the famous 'Rainbow Room.' These gigs opened doors for performances in Montreal and a European tour. While touring Europe he met a lovely French lady, Jeanne Maïstre, who, a year later became his wife. King left the group 'Au Naturel' and settled in the south of France where he started a new life on the French Riviera, opening his own music school – the “Price King Ecole Internationale de Chant.” He has had the pleasure over the years of seeing many of his students excel as singers on a professional level, and some going on to become national celebrities. He continues to coach young singers today, in his spare time.

Credit: The Nightly/Will Pearce Kim Kardashian launched Skims, her shapewear brand, in 2019 after spending years dabbing other undergarments with teabags to “nail the perfect nude shade”. “It's deeply personal to me,” says the reality-television star. It has also been tremendously lucrative. Skims now makes some $US1 billion ($1.5b) in sales a year. From fizzy drinks and footwear to fragrances, over the years celebrities have peddled them all. In the past, most stars were happy simply lending their faces to ad campaigns in return for a bit of extra pocket money. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters.

A few more entrepreneurial ones went a step further, involving themselves in the design of the products they endorsed. In the 1980s a chance encounter on an aeroplane between Jane Birkin, a British actress, and a senior executive at Hermès, a luxury brand, led to the creation of the Birkin bag. Around the same time Michael Jordan, a basketball star, teamed up with Nike, a sports brand, to launch the Air Jordan line of trainers. More recently, however, a growing number of celebrities have opted to build consumer enterprises of their own. Over the past decade or so, A-listers from Beyoncé and Rihanna to George Clooney and Harry Styles have launched beauty ranges, booze brands, fashion labels and more. A study in 2023 by JLL, a property firm, found that around three-fifths of celebrity retail brands in America had been founded in the preceding six years. Hailey Bieber launches skincare lipbalm for her brand Rhode Credit: Hailey Bieber/Instagram Since then the trend has continued apace, with stars from Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (men's skincare) and Emma Watson (gin) to Sir David Beckham (supplements) and Wiz Khalifa (mushroom-growing kits) all taking part. In May Hailey Bieber, wife of Justin Bieber, a pop star, sold her make-up brand Rhode to e.l.f. Beauty, a cosmetics firm, for as much as $1b. As the boundary between retail and social media blurs, celebrities are reshaping the world of consumer goods. The proliferation of celebrity brands is partly a reflection of changes in the media industry. In decades past, the business of communicating with consumers was largely intermediated by a handful of television channels, radio stations and print publications. No more. These days, says Douglas Holt, a marketing guru, every social-media account is a channel of its own. That has allowed celebrities to engage directly with their fans. Ms Kardashian has over 350m followers on Instagram. She frequently wears and talks about Skims online. “Kim is a phenomenal creative director,” says Jens Grede, her co-founder, “but she's also a one-woman media powerhouse.” According to Launchmetrics, an analytics firm, Skims last year generated more than $US600m in “media impact value”, a gauge of the monetary benefit of online posts, press coverage and other media exposure. That was eight times as much as for Spanx, a rival shapewear brand. Not only are celebrities now able to communicate directly with their fans. They can sell directly to them, too. Fledgling brands no longer need to sell via big retailers, who take a cut of profits, or to open physical stores, which involves enormous upfront investment. To sell online, they do not even need to go through e-commerce platforms like Amazon. Tools such as those offered by Shopify, a Canadian software firm, have made it easier than ever to build an e-commerce site or mobile app. Social-media platforms such as TikTok now allow brands to sell directly to users, too. Direct-to-consumer sales have risen to account for around one-seventh of e-commerce globally, according to NIQ, a data provider. Anita Balchandani of McKinsey, a consultancy, reckons they make up as much as 100 per cent of revenue in the early days of a typical celebrity brand, dropping to 30-60 per cent as firms expand and add third-party distribution. Of course, not every celebrity brand takes off. The Honest Company, a maker of baby and beauty products co-founded by Jessica Alba, an actress, has lost three-quarters of its market value since listing its shares in 2021. Alex Griffin, marketing chief for On, a sportswear brand worn by tennis player Roger Federer and actress Zendaya, says there is a reason many stars still opt for endorsements instead of starting their own brands: “It's not that easy.” Picking the right type of product matters. Clothes and booze are things people often buy for what they symbolise, rather than their functionality, says Sandra Cariglio of ReD Associates, an advisory firm. That makes them safer bets for celebrities. Attractive stars may naturally find it easy to sell beauty products, too. It helps that the production of cosmetics is easy to outsource to white-label manufacturers, as it is for fragrances. Jill Avery of Harvard Business School adds that products need to “fit” the celebrity's own brand. Fans buy make-up from Ms Bieber because she has long shared beauty tips online, and shapewear from Ms Kardashian because she is known for her curves. Asked why he is launching a running app, Mo Farah, an athlete with four Olympic gold medals to his name, says simply: “That's all I know.”..."

Instead, Bron Breakker intercepted the mic hand-off from Paul Heyman to express his hatred of Sami Zayn. Rollins and Heyman played it off like they were confused, and it felt like we were already getting a hint of dissension. They came around though, and then Rollins handed it off to Bronson Reed, and he finally (kind of) gave an explanation for how the pair mended fences. He essentially just said it came from respect, given how much he attacked Rollins. That still doesn't really make sense, but at least it was addressed. Heyman had his turn on the mic too, and was brilliant as always, even breaking out some secret Spanish skills to cut a promo on Penta. This was a wildly refreshing promo for a stable, as it helped add value to every member and removed any semblance of Reed and Breakker being limited to purely henchman roles. Rollins is still clearly the leader, but Reed and Breakker are great talents who deserve to be highlighted. So, more mic time works for me. Outside of a brief rally spot, Breakker effectively squashed Zayn in their match. That was the least interesting bit of this, however. Karrion Kross attacked Zayn with a pipe mid-entrance to lead this in the direction it went. So, a big stipulation rematch with Kross has to be on the horizon now, but he's been so underutilized that I doubt he'll get the much-needed win when that happens. I mean, the crowd chanted, ""We want Kross,"" rooting for this violent heel. Listen to the people, WWE. Reed's match with Uso wasn't much different. After some brief exchanges, they made their way outside and attempted a spot with the announce table chair, which ultimately led Reed to disqualify himself. The ""Sethriders"" made it clear at the top of the show that they just wanted to destroy their enemies, so it was what it was. Uso took a pair of tsunamis, and the staff security saved him. That was the only part that felt off. So, Uso gets saved by the company, but everyone else can get decimated? Thankfully, there was no squashing to be done in the main event when Rollins wrestled Penta. Who would have thought we'd ever see this match? Not me, but it delivered. Rollins picked up the win after a headbutt downstairs to Penta (a unique approach) into a stomp. It was a relatively anticlimactic finish to such a great match, but some of the near falls were excellent. On the negative side, the Penta losses keep on stacking up, which feels even more concerning considering his brother Rey Fenix is now paired with Andrade (and killing it) on ""WWE SmackDown."" LA Knight snuck in a surprise BFT after the match when Rollins and the boys appeared to do their typical post-match attack. I want to say it feels like Knight is finally getting some real steam behind him with this treatment, but how he gets injected adequately into a world title scene feels almost impossible. There is always leeway to give when someone has the Money In the Bank briefcase, and this is the perfect moment to elevate and put over Knight with a win over Rollins at Saturday Night's Main Event.

(©Ilustrasi dibuat dengan Grok AI) Perbedaan tinggi badan antara pria dan wanita menjadi perhatian para peneliti selama puluhan tahun. Secara global, pria rata-rata lebih tinggi sekitar 13 sentimeter dari wanita. Namun, penyebab pastinya bukan satu faktor tunggal, melainkan kombinasi rumit genetik, hormonal, dan lingkungan. Mengutip LiveScience, Selasa (8/7), penelitian menunjukkan sekitar 80 persen variasi tinggi badan dipengaruhi faktor genetik. Salah satu gen yang paling disorot adalah SHOX, yang terdapat pada kromosom seks X dan Y. Menurut studi yang diterbitkan di Nature, gen ini berperan penting dalam pertumbuhan tulang panjang dan menjelaskan sebagian dari selisih rata-rata tinggi pria dan wanita. Alexander Berry dari Geisinger College of Health Sciences mengungkap bahwa mutasi pada SHOX bisa menyebabkan gangguan pertumbuhan seperti Léri-Weill dyschondrosteosis. Selain itu, analisis terhadap lebih dari 928 ribu orang, termasuk individu dengan kelainan jumlah kromosom seks, menunjukkan dosis gen tambahan pada kromosom Y cenderung berdampak lebih besar pada peningkatan tinggi. Hormon: Faktor Penentu yang Kompleks Hormon juga memegang peran penting. Testosteron dikenal mendorong ciri khas laki-laki, termasuk pertumbuhan tulang lebih panjang. Namun, para ahli menegaskan hormon estrogen justru menjadi kunci dalam mengatur kapan pertumbuhan berhenti. Estrogen mendorong penutupan lempeng pertumbuhan tulang lebih cepat pada perempuan, membuat mereka berhenti tumbuh lebih awal. “Estrogen adalah bintang di sini,” kata Holly Dunsworth, profesor antropologi di University of Rhode Island. Alhasil, meski laki-laki dan perempuan sama-sama mengalami lonjakan pertumbuhan saat pubertas, pria cenderung punya waktu lebih lama untuk tumbuh. Pandangan lama menyebut laki-laki berevolusi lebih tinggi untuk bersaing secara fisik atau menunjukkan dominasi. Namun Dunsworth menilai penjelasan ini terlalu sederhana. Dalam makalah di Evolutionary Anthropology, ia menegaskan faktor biologis seperti peran estrogen memberikan gambaran yang lebih akurat. Meski genetika mendominasi, faktor lingkungan tidak bisa diabaikan. Nutrisi, kesehatan masa kanak-kanak, dan kondisi sosial ekonomi menyumbang sekitar 20% variasi tinggi badan. Anak dengan asupan gizi buruk atau yang sering sakit cenderung memiliki tinggi lebih pendek dibandingkan anak dengan lingkungan lebih mendukung. Ilmuwan seperti Berry menekankan bahwa faktor lain seperti ekspresi gen—seberapa aktif gen tertentu bekerja—juga berpengaruh pada variasi tinggi, bahkan di antara individu dengan profil genetik serupa."

mov_08884D42DB2A36344D299E1B9AC61342,2025-07-08 09:03:41,en,WEB,"  PROVIDENCE – Two Beacons Productions, the company filming the M. Night Shyamalan movie ""Remain"" in Rhode Island this summer, put up signs in downtown around the beginning of July that seem to set up some sort of treasure hunt. What would the intrepid adventurer who follows the signs find at the end of the trail? Will it be Shyamalan himself? Or ""Remain"" stars Jake Gyllenhaal, Ashley Walters or Phoebe Dynevor? Or is it just some sort of Shyamalan-like plot twist? We set out after the Fourth of July holiday to find out. And the trail had not yet gone cold. Shyamalan began filming June 18 at a coffee shop in downtown Warren, and added sets on the Prudence Island Ferry, a two-century-old general store in Little Compton, an historic tavern in Chepachet, the covered bridge in Foster and a seaside estate in Sakonnet Point. Where would the trail from downtown Providence lead? It starts at the Convention Center garage Two of the familiar yellow movie-crew signs are on a pole outside the entrance to the Rhode Island Convention Center Garage. One indicates that crew can park in the garage. The other directs the follower to head up West Exchange Street, away from downtown. It only bears the acronym for Two Beacons Productions, with no further information about where it leads. The first turn is a little-traveled side street Just after passing under Interstate 95, the trail turns left onto Bradford Street. After climbing Federal Hill and crossing Atwells Avenue, the trail reaches Broadway Adventurers find themselves across the street from Rocket to Mars, an antique store that supplied decor last summer when ""Twentieth Century Studios"" filmed the James L. Brooks movie ""Ella McCay"" – due out in December – in Providence. The trail takes a right on Broadway. The next turn is at a former 'Ella McCay' filming site After traveling several blocks up Broadway, the trail turns left onto Marshall Street, in sight of three locations used to film ""Ella McCay"": a brick row-house, a dark-gray clapboard house and the former corner store that was transformed into ""Helen's"" bar. Another turn, another 'Ella McCay' set Is this an M. Night Shyamalan treasure hunt? Or an ""Ella McCay"" retrospective tour? Marshall Street ends at Westminster Street, across the street from the West Side Diner, which was used to film ""Ella McCay"" and next to a row of condos, in front of which filming wrapped for ""Ella McCay"" in May last year. The trail turns right. At the end of Marshall Street, a sign indicates a right turn onto Westminster Street across from the West Side Diner, which was also used for ""Ella McCay"" filming. A short stretch to Parade Street and the promise of a movie set Just after passing the West Side Diner, the trail turns left onto Parade Street. And the signs change from the generic ""TBP"" to ones promising the trail leads to a movie set. The end is in sight The treasure hunt ends at the Cranston Street Armory, where a sound stage has been set up for indoor filming of much of M. Night Shyamalan's ""Remain."" Just before the end of Parade Street, the trail turns left into the parking lot for the Cranston Street Armory, where Two Beacons Productions has built a sound stage to film much of ""Remain."" And, yes, on any given day, you just might find Shyamalan, Gyllenhaal, Walters or Dynevor inside. More in U.S. So, this treasure hunt had five twists and turns along the way from the Convention Center. Is that worthy of M. Night Shyamalan?"

Luckily, as the Ocean State, Rhode Island has plenty of scenic places by the water to enjoy a craft beverage, including breweries, rooftop bars and for the wine lovers, vineyards. But which of the state's wineries is the oldest? Opened just a mile away from the Sakonnet River in Little Compton 50 years ago, Sakonnet Vineyard is not only the oldest vineyard in Rhode Island, but in all of New England. Here's a brief history of the vineyard, as well as how to enjoy a glass of wine there this summer. History of Sakonnet Vineyard Sakonnet Vineyard first opened for business in 1975 as one of the first in the New England region. According to Providence Journal archives from July 1978, owners James A. and Lolly M. Mitchell settled on the water-surrounded Rhode Island location because its climate conditions resemble those of the French grape-growing region of Bordeaux. The Mitchell's first planted the 120-acre vineyard with grapes from France in a grid of posts and wires, a 1975 article from The Providence Journal said. Today, the vineyard has expanded to 169 scenic acres, over 30 of which are dedicated to producing award-winning wines. Sakonnet is open to the public for tours of the grounds, seasonal food tastings from the cafe menu and of course, wine tastings, with homegrown wines including Belcourt White, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir Coastal Blend. Sakonnet is owned by  Carolyn Rafaelian, the founder of Alex & Ani, who purchased the vineyard in 2012 from the late Earl and Susan Samson who ran it for 25 years. In addition to regular operations, Sakonnet Vineyard also hosts a variety of special events, including live concerts, festivals and even murder mystery dinner parties. How to go to Sakonnet Vineyard Sakonnet Vineyard is open to the public from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. every Thursday through Sunday. Reservations are not necessary unless the visit is for eight or more people. Sakonnet wines are also available for purchase online, with shipping available in 40 states. The vineyard is located at 162 W Main Road in Little Compton."

mov_51F6E28FF776D068F9103AE2C01BDD2E,2025-07-08 10:01:31,en,WEB,"  On this date in Boston Celtic history, fan-favorite big man Al Horford signed with the team in 2016. A standout at the University of Florida, where the Dominican center won two national titles in consecutive seasons, Horford was drafted third overall by the Atlanta Hawks, with whom he spent nine seasons before choosing to sign with the Celtics. The former Gator left Atlanta in free agency after the Hawks were swept by the Cleveland Cavaliers in the playoffs two years in a row. He signed a four-year, $113 million contract with Boston. The Celtics made the Eastern Conference finals twice during Horford's first tenure with the team. The Puerto Plata native also made an All-Star team and an All-Defensive second team while with Boston in that stint. After a disappointing 2018-19 season with the team that saw a number of factors destroy a highly anticipated campaign, Horford opted to test the free market. The Boston star was tendered a considerable offer by the Philadelphia 76ers that the Celtics did not match. They later traded assets to get him back on their cap sheet -- more on that shortly. Horford struggled in an over-packed Sixers frontcourt and was dealt to the Oklahoma City Thunder the following offseason. He rebuilt his reputation as one of the league's most complete big men, only to be dealt back to Boston at the end of the 2020-21 campaign. He was an instrumental part of the team's run to the 2022 NBA Finals, and their 2024 title. It was also on this date in 2009 that four-time All-Star Rasheed Wallace signed with the Celtics. The former UNC standout played one season with Boston before retiring for two seasons. He averaged 9 points, 4.1 boards, an assist, and a steal per game. It was on this date the Celtics lost wing Earl Shannon in 2002. The Rhode Island native (who went on to become an FBI agent after his basketball career) played five games for Boston in the 1948-49 season before retiring. He averaged 1 point per game over that stretch -- rest in peace. Finally, it is also the day Hall of Fame forward Frank Ramsey passed away in 2018. The Kentucky native played nine seasons over 10 years (a year in the armed forces interrupting) with the Celtics, winning titles in seven of them while pioneering the role of the sixth man in the early NBA."

The confirmation of the next head of the Federal Aviation Administration will headline the Senate floor agenda this week. President Donald Trump's nominee for the FAA job is Bryan Bedford, who just retired as president of Republic Airways. He had been with the regional carrier since 1999. Bedford's nomination came out of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on a 15-13 party-line vote, with Democrats expressing concern about his position on the requirement for pilots to have 1,500 hours of in-flight training. ""It is deeply disturbing that at this critical moment in aviation safety Mr. Bedford refuses to commit to upholding the 1,500-hour pilot training requirement,"" Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth said in a statement ahead of the committee vote. ""Amid a surge in near-misses, an air traffic controller shortage, aging air traffic control equipment and facilities, and in the wake of the first major deadly commercial crash in more than a decade, now is not the time to weaken flight hour requirements for all aspiring airline pilots."" But Bedford has found broad support among Republicans and is likely to be confirmed. ""Mr. Bedford doesn't just have an exemplary safety record at Republic; he's also a pilot himself and understands the challenges of the job,"" Senate Commerce Chairman Ted Cruz of Texas said last month when his committee considered the nomination. ""He's familiar with the stress, the endless medical requirements, and how various airspaces work. He's just as familiar with aviation safety as previous nominees - if not more so."" Before turning to the FAA nomination, senators will consider the nomination of Preston Griffith to be undersecretary of Energy. Griffith picked up some Democratic Caucus support at the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, including from the ranking member, New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich. The remaining nominations already in the queue for the week are Trump's choices to lead the Office of Personnel Management and to be the deputy administrator of the Small Business Administration. The lighter floor schedule after the July Fourth holiday comes as a short respite between weeks with late nights on the agenda. Last week, it was the reconciliation bill that Trump signed into law on July Fourth. Next week, it will likely include a vote-a-rama in connection with the president's proposed rescissions package. But the sparse floor schedule for this week belies the reality that many senators will be busy behind the scenes. The Senate Armed Services Committee has a full week of subcommittee and full committee markups of the fiscal 2026 defense authorization bill, which per tradition, is considered largely in closed session. The full committee markup for the defense policy bill kicks off Wednesday, also behind closed doors. It will continue on Thursday if senators need the time to finish the process. Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, is among the senators who will be exceptionally busy, since he also sits on the Appropriations Committee. The same is true for New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Senate appropriators get the ball rolling Thursday morning on their full committee markups for fiscal 2026 spending bills, taking up a trio of measures that include funding for the Agriculture, Commerce and Justice departments, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, federal science programs and the legislative branch. There's no sign of a broader agreement between Republicans and Democrats on spending levels for fiscal 2026, but the first bills out of the gate tend to be among the less controversial. There are other hearings and markups on the Senate schedule, as well. On Wednesday, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will be looking at cybersecurity and privacy issues related to health care. The Energy and Natural Resources panel has a Thursday hearing on the Forest Service budget. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, following a visit to the White House a day earlier. The prime minister is expected to meet with key lawmakers. That includes a bipartisan Senate meeting featuring Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York, as well as a separate meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. Netanyahu arrived in Washington overnight Sunday into Monday, and the president hosted him for dinner Monday evening. The visit comes amid a ceasefire between Israel and Iran that appeared to be holding, following Trump's ordered strikes on key Iranian nuclear targets.

But the sparse floor schedule for this week belies the reality that many senators will be busy behind the scenes. The Senate Armed Services Committee has a full week of subcommittee and full committee markups of the fiscal 2026 defense authorization bill, which per tradition, is considered largely in closed session. The full committee markup for the defense policy bill kicks off Wednesday, also behind closed doors. It will continue on Thursday if senators need the time to finish the process. Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, is among the senators who will be exceptionally busy, since he also sits on the Appropriations Committee. The same is true for New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Senate appropriators get the ball rolling Thursday morning on their full committee markups for fiscal 2026 spending bills, taking up a trio of measures that include funding for the Agriculture, Commerce and Justice departments, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, federal science programs and the legislative branch. There's no sign of a broader agreement between Republicans and Democrats on spending levels for fiscal 2026, but the first bills out of the gate tend to be among the less controversial. There are other hearings and markups on the Senate schedule, as well. On Wednesday, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will be looking at cybersecurity and privacy issues related to health care. The Energy and Natural Resources panel has a Thursday hearing on the Forest Service budget. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, following a visit to the White House a day earlier. The prime minister is expected to meet with key lawmakers. That includes a bipartisan Senate meeting featuring Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York, as well as a separate meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

The confirmation of the next head of the Federal Aviation Administration will headline the Senate floor agenda this week. President Donald Trump's nominee for the FAA job is Bryan Bedford, who just retired as president of Republic Airways. He had been with the regional carrier since 1999. Bedford's nomination came out of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on a 15-13 party-line vote, with Democrats expressing concern about his position on the requirement for pilots to have 1,500 hours of in-flight training. ""It is deeply disturbing that at this critical moment in aviation safety Mr. Bedford refuses to commit to upholding the 1,500-hour pilot training requirement,"" Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth said in a statement ahead of the committee vote. ""Amid a surge in near-misses, an air traffic controller shortage, aging air traffic control equipment and facilities, and in the wake of the first major deadly commercial crash in more than a decade, now is not the time to weaken flight hour requirements for all aspiring airline pilots."" But Bedford has found broad support among Republicans and is likely to be confirmed. ""Mr. Bedford doesn't just have an exemplary safety record at Republic; he's also a pilot himself and understands the challenges of the job,"" Senate Commerce Chairman Ted Cruz of Texas said last month when his committee considered the nomination. ""He's familiar with the stress, the endless medical requirements, and how various airspaces work. He's just as familiar with aviation safety as previous nominees - if not more so.""

mov_B160BE77DB9C4C8F37107442C6AF2C60,2025-07-08 13:23:02,en,WEB,"  WASHINGTON - Senators will have the Capitol to themselves when they return Tuesday for an abbreviated work period, with the House taking the week off after narrowly pushing through Republicans' sweeping domestic policy package. The confirmation of the next head of the Federal Aviation Administration will headline the Senate floor agenda this week. President Donald Trump's nominee for the FAA job is Bryan Bedford, who just retired as president of Republic Airways. He had been with the regional carrier since 1999. Bedford's nomination came out of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee on a 15-13 party-line vote, with Democrats expressing concern about his position on the requirement for pilots to have 1,500 hours of in-flight training. ""It is deeply disturbing that at this critical moment in aviation safety Mr. Bedford refuses to commit to upholding the 1,500-hour pilot training requirement,"" Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth said in a statement ahead of the committee vote. ""Amid a surge in near-misses, an air traffic controller shortage, aging air traffic control equipment and facilities, and in the wake of the first major deadly commercial crash in more than a decade, now is not the time to weaken flight hour requirements for all aspiring airline pilots."" But Bedford has found broad support among Republicans and is likely to be confirmed. ""Mr. Bedford doesn't just have an exemplary safety record at Republic; he's also a pilot himself and understands the challenges of the job,"" Senate Commerce Chairman Ted Cruz of Texas said last month when his committee considered the nomination. ""He's familiar with the stress, the endless medical requirements, and how various airspaces work. He's just as familiar with aviation safety as previous nominees - if not more so."" Before turning to the FAA nomination, senators will consider the nomination of Preston Griffith to be undersecretary of Energy. Griffith picked up some Democratic Caucus support at the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, including from the ranking member, New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich. The remaining nominations already in the queue for the week are Trump's choices to lead the Office of Personnel Management and to be the deputy administrator of the Small Business Administration. The lighter floor schedule after the July Fourth holiday comes as a short respite between weeks with late nights on the agenda. Last week, it was the reconciliation bill that Trump signed into law on July Fourth. Next week, it will likely include a vote-a-rama in connection with the president's proposed rescissions package. But the sparse floor schedule for this week belies the reality that many senators will be busy behind the scenes. The Senate Armed Services Committee has a full week of subcommittee and full committee markups of the fiscal 2026 defense authorization bill, which per tradition, is considered largely in closed session. The full committee markup for the defense policy bill kicks off Wednesday, also behind closed doors. It will continue on Thursday if senators need the time to finish the process. Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Armed Services Committee, is among the senators who will be exceptionally busy, since he also sits on the Appropriations Committee. The same is true for New Hampshire Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. Senate appropriators get the ball rolling Thursday morning on their full committee markups for fiscal 2026 spending bills, taking up a trio of measures that include funding for the Agriculture, Commerce and Justice departments, as well as the Food and Drug Administration, federal science programs and the legislative branch. There's no sign of a broader agreement between Republicans and Democrats on spending levels for fiscal 2026, but the first bills out of the gate tend to be among the less controversial. There are other hearings and markups on the Senate schedule, as well. On Wednesday, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee will be looking at cybersecurity and privacy issues related to health care. The Energy and Natural Resources panel has a Thursday hearing on the Forest Service budget. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be on Capitol Hill on Tuesday, following a visit to the White House a day earlier. The prime minister is expected to meet with key lawmakers. That includes a bipartisan Senate meeting featuring Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota and Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer of New York, as well as a separate meeting with Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

Several US states offer paid family leave, including provisions for caregivers, with California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Washington being the most prominent examples. Additionally, Washington D.C. has a paid leave program. Some states also have employer-funded insurance pools to partially replace wages for caregivers. States with Paid Family Leave for Caregivers: * **California:** Offers paid family leave benefits for caregivers. * **Connecticut:** Implemented paid family leave, effective January 1, 2022. * **Massachusetts:** Provides paid leave for caregivers. * **New Jersey:** Has a paid family leave program. * **New York:** Offers paid time off for family caregiving. * **Rhode Island:** Provides paid leave to care for family members. * **Washington:** Implements paid family leave benefits. * **Washington D.C.:** Has a paid leave program for caregivers. * **Colorado:** Will begin offering paid leave benefits in 2023. * **Oregon:** Will begin offering paid leave benefits in 2024. Just as you stated - this is a German law and not every EU country have similar while I know many employers will still give their workers some leeway in such case with making a fuss. So, as you can see in US there are some states where they have such laws in their 'infant' phase. Once again - employers in US are much more ruthless and if given the chance will curb-stomp any attempt to use such laws in your favor if it can be avoided. >Regarding protection when forming a union And this is my point. They do have the same law in case of other cases if forming union is not even covered (racism, sexism, religious difference and age), they do not offer same protection and by doing so make employees open to retaliation and making the law meaningless. Which does not mean they do not have similar laws. I have plenty of friends working in the US which were completely legally fired for one excuse or another when the reason was obvious as it was methodically focused on a group of people in similar situation."

I've traced my line back to **Lord Jean de Vars**, born in 1620 in the Parish of St. Martin Sepert Per (possibly a mistranscription—if anyone recognizes the correct parish name, I'd love help clarifying it). He was my 9th great-grandfather. His son, **John de Vars**, was born in 1653 in the Limoges area of France. He traveled to Rhode Island, apparently liked what he saw, and returned to France to bring his wife **Mary** and their young son **Isaac**, born **1682**. On the return trip to the U.S., John de Vars was reportedly killed—either in a duel or murdered outright for his money.

He just needs to put together an illustrated love story to get in, so he does what we all would: he goes to Nantucket with his friends George (Joel Murray) and Squid Calamari (Kristen Goelz). After they rescue singer Cassandra Eldridge (Demi Moore) from a motorcyle gang, they settle in for a summer of hijnks with twins Egg (Bobcat Goldthwaite) and Clay Stork (Tom Willard) and Ack-Ack Raymond (Curtis Armstrong), much of which is about saving Cassandra's family home from the Beckersted family (Mark Metcalf, William Hickey, Matt Mulhern).

The search subsequently led to the discovery of female human remains, with the circumstances surrounding the death leading officials to request the assistance of the Maine State Police Major Crimes Unit Central. 2 CAMPING IN MICHIGAN ON REMOTE WILDERNESS ISLAND ARE FOUND DEAD Crawford Pond is located approximately 15 miles from Camden, Maine. (Alamy) The woman has been identified as 48-year-old Sunshine Stewart of nearby Tenants Harbor, according to MSP.

Suazo's body showed no signs of trauma and the cause of death remains under investigation by the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner. At least 13 bodies have been recovered throughout Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts and Maine, with many of them found in remote or wooded areas, since March 2025.

Without missing a beat, Becky pulled the gate aside, ran over, and helped the other people pick up the lady off of her wheelchair and made sure she was okay in her wheelchair. She spoke with her for a few minutes and then the lady wished her good luck tonight.

mov_1978479B847E8663E090BA0AB2F751D6,2025-07-08 16:58:39,en,WEB,"  Transgender and nonbinary people have won the right to change their gender marker on their U.S. passports — but only for now. Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced in January that his department would no longer process passport applications that sought the X gender marker and would not allow those renewing passports to change their gender marker, in keeping with Donald Trump's executive order denying the existence of trans people. Several trans and nonbinary people filed a lawsuit against the policy, known as Orr v. Trump, with the assistance of the American Civil Liberties Union. U.S. District Court Judge Julia Kobick issued a preliminary injunction blocking the rule in April, saying it can't be enforced against the plaintiffs while their lawsuit proceeds. She then expanded the injunction in June by granting class certification to almost all trans and nonbinary Americans, allowing them to update their passports. “This decision is a critical victory against discrimination and for equal justice under the law,” Li Nowlin-Sohl, Senior Staff Attorney for the ACLU's LGBTQ & HIV Project, said in a statement. “But it's also a historic win in the fight against this administration's efforts to drive transgender people out of public life. The State Department's policy is a baseless barrier for transgender, nonbinary, and intersex Americans and denies them the dignity we all deserve. We encourage all class members impacted by this policy to take advantage of this injunctive relief and we will do everything we can to block this policy permanently.” Here's everything you need to know if you're trying to change the gender marker on your passport or other federal documents. Can trans people renew their passports? Trans people are able to update their passports with the sex marker that aligns with their gender identity as of June 17 after a judge blocked the Trump Administration's policy prohibiting it. The State Department requires that those requesting a gender change complete an attestation form and submit it with their application to prove they are part of the class impacted by the ruling. Applicants do not need to formally join the class, and are protected under the decision if they are seeking an X designation, or seeking a male or female designator that differs from their sex assigned at birth and have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria, according to the American Civil Liberties Union. The ruling covers those who have applied — or would have applied if not for the policy — if they do not have a currently valid passport, need to renew their passport because it expires within one year, need to update their sex designation or legal name, or those whose passport was lost, stolen, or damaged. Additional instructions can be found here. When should trans people update their passports? Those seeking to update the gender marker on their passport should submit their application immediately. Passports take approximately four to six weeks on average to process, per the State Department, and while the Trump Administration's policy is currently blocked by a court order, legal organizations stress that the ruling could be reversed on appeal as the case proceeds. Lambda Legal warns, ""Be aware: the government may appeal, and if a higher court pauses this ruling, the restrictive policy could return immediately. Even pending applications could be affected."" Should trans people update their birth certificates? Trans people legally changing their name must update their birth certificate so that it matches other documents. However, the gender on someone's birth certificate does not have to match other documents such as passports, per the ACLU, meaning federal identification that does not align with one's sex assigned at birth is still valid even in states that have banned gender marker changes. Those who are able to should still update their gender on their birth certificate so that it contains the most accurate information. The process for updating birth certificates varies by state, and must be done through the state you were born in — not the state you currently live in. What states allow gender changes on birth certificates? Eight states currently do not allow gender markers on birth certificates to be changed: Florida, Iowa, Indiana, Kansas Montana, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas. An additional eight require both a court order and proof of surgery, making a legal gender change hard to obtain. Birth certificates can be updated in every other state, though the process varies. 16 states and Washington, D.C. allow residents to mark M, F, or X on their birth certificates: California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, and Washington, according to the Movement Advancement Project. Can trans people update their sex with Social Security? The Social Security Administration issued guidance in January prohibiting people from making changes to their sex designation. However, Social Security cards only list name and number — not sex. The SSA does keep records on the date of birth and sex of each person who has a Social Security card, but trans people can still update other forms of identification even if their gender marker doesn't match the SSA's, as Advocates for Trans Equality outlines.

This prestigious role is given to only one designer each calendar year. Li brings a wealth of experience to the role, and with a bold, unique design style. Li's design philosophy prioritizes the sensory, spatial, and poetic functions of design, ensuring that each project resonates with both clarity and emotional impact. Their academic background is as impressive as their professional experience. Li holds an MFA in Graphic Design from the Yale School of Art and a dual BArch and BFA in Architecture from the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), where they also participated in the European Honors Program. Before joining the Walker, Li honed their skills at Pentagram, the internationally renowned design studio, where they contributed to the immersive experience of Rolling Stone's legacy for Illuminarium Las Vegas. Their tenure at Isometric Studio in New York saw them contributing to major cultural projects such as “Contemporary Muslim Fashions” at Cooper Hewitt, “re: collections” and “Frida Kahlo: POSE” at Rose Art Museum, and the AIGA-recognized project “Company.” At Isometric, Li melded an architectural sensibility with typographic precision, crafting spatial identities deeply rooted in equity-driven storytelling. Li, born in China in 1995, is a graphic designer, graphic artist, and exhibition designer whose work gracefully navigates the intersections of image, language, material, and space. At the Walker, Li is actively contributing to exhibition graphics, institutional campaign identities, and brand refresh initiatives, bringing a unique blend of material experimentation and conceptual depth to the institution. In 2023–24, Li developed the full exhibition identity for “Groundwater Earth: The Before and After of the Tubewell,” curated by architect and scholar Anthony Acciavatti at the Yale School of Architecture. Drawing inspiration from cylindrical drilling diagrams, water flow systems, and dot-line mirroring motifs, Li created a visual system that bridged geospatial infrastructure with design history. This layered approach to editorial, spatial, and tactile methods resulted in a resonant narrative field. At the Walker, Li collaborates closely with curators, fabricators, and fellow designers to shape public encounters with contemporary art. Their designs are not merely about clarity but about evoking specific effects, emphasizing material presence, and fostering conceptual resonance. They are currently leading the development of a new wayfinding system that aligns with the Walker's brand refresh, as well as designing the seasonal identity for Mini Golf, one of the museum's most popular public programs. Delving into the Art of Book Design and Collaboration Beyond exhibition design and institutional branding, Li has a profound connection to the world of art books, approaching each project as a unique and collaborative endeavor. Asked about their approach to designing art books and collaborating with artists, Li explains, “Whether self-initiated or in collaboration, my approach always begins with identifying a point of entry. That entry could be a single word, material, or gesture—something that threads the design method, image treatment, and conceptual framing together. Sometimes it's drawn directly from the artist's work; other times, it emerges in dialogue, as a shared reference or an intuitive form of trust.” Li views the book not just as a container, but as an object in itself—a materialization of thought, pace, and structure. “Designing a book means establishing a system of rules: how the general conceptual approach is translated into image-text relationship, how typography is expressed, how images are treated and displayed, how silence is treated. But equally important is knowing when to break those rules. Books are tactile, time-based, and durational—they invite touch, pause, and sequencing. They should invite interruptions and hold contradictions,” they add. Collaboration, for Li, is about extending the logic of the artist's work, not imposing their own. “Aside from understanding the background, research, and content of the works, my design also responds to the work's tone, texture, rhythm, and emotions—whether that means mimicking breath patterns, channeling archival systems as visual anecdote, or leaving deliberate gaps. It's not about illustrating the work, but amplifying its atmosphere—letting the book become a space where thoughts and form unfold together.” Notable Art Book Designs: A Glimpse into Li's Creative Process When asked about specific examples of their best designs for art books, Li highlights a particularly meaningful project with artist Sophy Naess. “The book compiles her past personal writings—zines she had self-published over the years—into a cohesive volume. My role was to preserve the diaristic, intimate quality of the work while giving it new form. I chose Pirelli, a revival typeface of uncertain origin, full of quirky gestures that resist traditional elegance. The format mimics a classic paperback but is slightly scaled down to echo home-printed zines, using folded letter-size paper. Since it's an artist's journal, there's no image but only text. Typographic treatment became the most important part during the design process. Different indentation, italicization, and line breaks signify different voice, types of writing and quotations. Sophy printed and hand-bound every copy herself, keeping the tactile and personal spirit alive.” Book cover for Weavers Discourse: Fragments c:Daedalus Li Another significant project was the Yale School of Art Painting and Printmaking 2024 thesis catalog, “and the forms which linger humming in our ears,” titled after a line from Aimé Césaire's Le Verbe Mâronner. “With my collaborator Darnell Henderson, we restructured the book to physically split in half—one side for artist bios and works, the other for reflective journals. This mirrored the duality of exhibition and process. The back section was treated with a consistent image threshold effect, creating visual cohesion while allowing each section to echo and inform the other. The result was a catalog that requires viewer to shift the reading sequence to understand the connection between the artowrks and each artist's personal notaitons, structurally intentional, yet “ These titles have found their way into artist-forward spaces like Printed Matter (NY), bungee space (NY), ss space space (Taiwan), Multiple Formats (Boston), and Artbook @ MoMA PS1. They also reside in institutional collections, including the Yale University Robert B. Haas Family Arts Library and RISD Fleet Library. Many circulate through informal channels—gifted, mailed, traded, shown at art book fairs, or tucked into exhibitions. The distribution, Li notes, often prioritizes the intimacy of exchange over commercial routes...."

The US Department of Education said the funds were under review, “given the change in Administrations,” but did not provide additional details about why they were being held up. In New Hampshire, a total of $27 million has been withheld, according to a report by the National Education Association, a teacher's union. “The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,” said a June 30 message the federal department sent the New Hampshire Department of Education. Other New England states have had their funding put on pause too, the National Education Association found: $107.6 million for Massachusetts, $29.4 million for Rhode Island; $26 million for Vermont; $27.6 million for Maine; and $53.6 million for Connecticut. “We recognize that this situation brings uncertainty to budgets and program planning,” New Hampshire Education Commissioner Frank Edelblut said in a message to school leaders and program administrators last week. He said the department “is actively working with federal partners and internally to support your students and staff.” Here's a breakdown from the National Education Association of where the funding pause will hit New Hampshire schools. Professional development for educators (Title II, A): $10.8 million Services for English leaners (Title III, A): $1 million Student support and academic enrichment (Title IV, A): $6.7 million Before- and after-school programs (Title IV, part B): $6.5 million Literacy and general instructional services for adult services: $1.9 million Migrant education (Title I, C): $100,000. This funding provides services for students whose families work in transient industries such as fisheries and food processing, requiring them to move from state to state during the year, according to Education Week. Deb Howes, the president of the teacher's union AFT-NH, said school districts are counting on this money to run summer programs, including training teachers based on the latest research. “It helps teachers learn in the summer to be ready for back to school,” she said. And, she said, schools need to be ready to hire for after-school programs. “We can't wait while the government plays with impoundment,” she said.

Ahead of Monday's episode of WWE Raw in Providence, Rhode Island, a number of fans gathered outside to greet the WWE Superstars as they arrived at Amica Mutual Pavilion. According to one witness, that's when a wholesome moment unfolded between WWE Women's Intercontinental Champion Becky Lynch and another, wheelchair-bound fan. “I'm outside the arena, as you can tell, and Becky Lynch and Seth Rollins were walking away from their bus,” the spectator, named Gladys, recalled in a video on Twitter/X . “I guess they had to go do something inside, when somebody fell out of their wheelchair. “I'm about maybe ten feet away from the fence where everyone's getting autographs. Without missing a beat, Becky pulled the gate aside, ran over, and helped the other people pick up the lady off of her wheelchair and made sure she was okay in her wheelchair. She spoke with her for a few minutes and then the lady wished her good luck tonight. Becky went back, signed a couple autographs, and then she had to go inside to do what she needed to do.” A story about Becky Lynch pic.twitter.com/FJRaAkgXPj — Gladys CB (@thatdariachick) July 7, 2025 Later in her television outing, Lynch traded words with Lyra Valkyria and Bayley, who will challenge her for the Women's Intercontinental Title at WWE Evolution. This encounter eventually turned physical, with Valkyria laying out both Bayley and Lynch with Night Wings before telling Lynch it would be the last time her hand was raised.

mov_BB503307AF62D6928D90A03E9FB20572,2025-07-08 20:24:49,en,WEB,"  A Massachusetts student school cell phone ban cleared its first hurdle Tuesday, after a state legislative committee voted to advance a bill in the Senate. The measure follows similar bans in more than a dozen other states, and several local bans in schools across Massachusetts. Supporters have argued the devices in school distract students and encourage heavy use of social media, contributing to a growing mental health crisis among the nation's youth. The Senate bill would require every public school and district to have a policy on the use of personal electronic devices on school grounds and during school-sponsored activities “to reduce distractions, maintain environments focused on learning and protect the privacy and safety of students and staff,” according to a draft of the legislation. The prohibition would include devices like cell phones, tablets, smartwatches, and Bluetooth headphones, according to the draft bill. The Massachusetts legislation would require schools to prohibit physical access to devices like phones and smartwatches, and have those policies in place before the start of the 2026-27 school year. It also directs the state's K-12 education department to provide guidance to the schools and districts guidance on the creation of such policies. The proposal includes several exemptions for students who need access to personal electronic devices, including as part of a student's special education plan, accommodations to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, English language learners, during emergencies, and issues related to “school and student health and safety,” according to language of the bill. It also requires schools to have a method for parents and guardians to contact students during the school day, or for a student to reach their parent or guardian. The measure approved by the legislature's Joint Committee on Education has the support of Senate President Karen Spilka. In a joint statement with Senator Jason M. Lewis, the senate chair of the committee, Spilka and Lewis hailed the vote. “The cell phone is one of the most distracting devices ever created. Overwhelming evidence shows us that cell phones are major barriers to student growth and achievement in the classroom, and they make it harder for our talented educators to teach,” they said in the joint statement. The bill now moves to the Senate's Ways and Means Committee, though lawmakers did not say when the legislation may come up for a full Senate vote. House Speaker Ron Mariano, himself a former teacher, did not respond to a question Tuesday on whether he'd support a school cell phone ban. Nearly three quarters of US high school teachers said cell phones distract students and cause a major problem for classrooms, according to a Pew Research report from last year. The Massachusetts Teachers Association, state Education Secretary Patrick Tutwiler, and state Attorney General Andrea Campbell have all supported banning students from having cell phones in classrooms. Part of the concern over in-classroom use of cell phones is the access social media platforms. Health officials like former US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy have warned heavy social media use by young people is associated with “significant mental health harms.” As of May, a majority of states have imposed measures that ban or restrict students from using cellphones in schools, or recommend schools create their own policies, according to the Associated Press. Ten states — Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Nebraska, North Dakota, New York, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Virginia — have imposed a full ban on cell phones during the school day, while seven more prohibit phones during class time. And last month, Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee signed a bill requiring school districts to enact policies banning phones and other personal electronic devices during the school day. In Massachusetts, school districts in places like Newton, Brockton, Fall River, Methuen, and Ipswich have rules in place restricting students from cell phones. In a previous interview, Jonathan Mitchell, the principal of Ipswich High School, said a cell phone ban launched last fall changed the school for the better. At Ipswich, students who bring their phones to the high school have to turn their phones over to teachers at the start of the day and retrieve them when classes end. Students talk to each other more often, the cafeteria is louder, and fewer teens have their faces looking at cell phone screens, he said. “It's hard to quantify with data, but it appears to have had a positive impact on school culture,” Mitchell said."

Rhode has taken over the beach club Gran Folies in Majorca, Spain, from Wednesday to July 23 with gray and yellow sun loungers, towels, ice cream treats and beach inflatables. “Rhode summer club has lived on my brand vision board since the earliest days of building Rhode. Bringing this world to life has been such a fun and fulfilling journey,” Bieber told WWD. “Summertime really captures the essence of the Rhode vibe, and I'm so proud to be unveiling the dreamy, sun-soaked 'Lemontini' universe we've created. We've always loved connecting with our community through unexpected, IRL experiences, so we knew this had to feel really special — something that truly reflects the imagery and inspiration behind the product launch,” she added. The pop-up is a result of Rhode's success with immersive experiences, such as its photo booth that has touched down in Los Angeles, New York, London and Ibiza last year. To get in the summer mood, the brand unveiled its latest Peptide Lip Tint, the Lemontini, inspired by the citrusy summer cocktail that naturally fits into Rhode's beach club. “The Rhode beach club exemplifies how we like to bring our products to market in a disruptive, exciting way. We build a visual world around our innovation to delight and get the community excited about what we are launching and then pair this with a physical, immersive, IRL experience to showcase this world for our community to see, touch, feel and be a part of,” said Lauren Ratner, Rhode's cofounder, president and chief brand officer. “We wanted to create a new kind of experience this summer for our European audience to experience the world of Rhode like never before,” she added, referring to the company's branded beach loungers, cozy towels, sun umbrellas and sporty water bottles. More in Lifestyle The beach club project has been in the making for over a year and in the process, Rhode Futures Foundation has teamed with Associació Tardor, a shelter in Majorca that helps fight poverty and social exclusion in the region. The foundation has made a donation to Associació Tardor to support the shelter's kitchen improvements, lockers for residents and monthly food budget. As reported, Bieber has been fixating on summer and what she wants to put out. “My vision has been clear for months about what the world of Rhode summer is going to look like. I have a whole world that's coming and ready to go, just think very European, beautiful summer,” she told WWD last month."

A suspect who allegedly made a bomb threat on an Allegiant Air flight over the weekend was arrested Sunday afternoon and charged with false information and threats. Taj Malik Tayor, 27, of Largo, Florida, told another passenger on Allegiant Air flight 1023, headed to Roanoke, Virginia, that his laptop was a bomb, according to the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office. The plane had taken off from St. Pete-Clearwater International Airport (PIE), and quickly returned to that airport after the alleged threat. “The passenger immediately notified the flight attendants,” the sheriff's office said. “Detectives say several other witnesses on the plane also heard Taylor state that he had a bomb.” A mugshot of Taj Malik Taylor taken on Jul. 6, 2025.

They did not find a bomb. According to Pinellas County jail records, Taylor was booked just before 11:30 p.m. on Sunday night, and was released from custody about 11 hours later on Monday morning. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has taken over the case, and provided an arrest affidavit for Taylor. BOMB THREAT GROUNDS SPIRIT AIRLINES FLIGHT AT DETROIT METRO AIRPORT: 'POTENTIAL SECURITY ISSUE' The affidavit says that Taylor, “knowing the information to be false, willfully and maliciously with reckless disregard for the safety of human life, gave, under circumstances in which the information may have reasonably believed, false information about an alleged attempt being made to do an act… specifically, possession on or about the defendant's person an explosive device…” According to the affidavit, Taylor told investigators that he made the comments after a passenger was rude to him, and said that he was recently released from a mental health facility. He said he had taken medication on Saturday, the day before the alleged threat, and was “suffering from a lack of clarity.” Taylor appeared in court Monday morning, according to the FBI.

And if there's even a teeny tiny hint of suspicion, she checks with me first. Every suspicious text, weird pop-up, or ""urgent"" email goes straight to me for review. I've become her personal fraud filter — and I honestly don't mind. Because while she may be in her early 70s, I don't see her as “old.” She swims for an hour three times a week. She lifts weights. She knows how to put together an Instagram reel. Related: Say goodbye to those perfect travel-size hotel toiletries She's sharp, on top of trends, and more tech-savvy than people half her age. But even she triple-checks. And I don't blame her. Because lately, the scammers have gotten really good. They're cloning voices, faking photos, and spoofing messages so realistic, you'd second-guess yourself. And the truth is...even the savviest seniors are at risk. Now the FBI is sounding the alarm, and the numbers back it up. FBI says elder scams surged nearly 50% last year Ahead of World Elder Abuse Awareness Day in June, the FBI released new data showing elder fraud complaints rose 46% in 2024 — resulting in $4.9 billion in losses. That's not a typo. $4.9 BILLION in losses. Yikes. More than 147,000 complaints were filed last year, and officials say that's likely just a fraction of the actual cases. In Massachusetts alone, victims reported nearly $100 million in losses. New Hampshire and Maine saw more than $28 million combined, and even Rhode Island, one of the smallest states, tallied over $6 million in stolen funds. Related: Amazon's Alexa AI upgrade is even worse than expected “Elder fraud is a growing problem and a shameful crime,” said FBI Boston Acting Special Agent in Charge Kimberly Milka in a press release. “Not only does it rob an already vulnerable population of their sense of security, but it leaves them with devastating financial losses.” The scams are wide-ranging: Tech support pop-upsPhony romance schemesInvestment pitchesMoney mule operations And many rely on artificial intelligence to mimic voices, generate fake identities, or spoof real institutions. AI is making it harder and harder to spot a scam Why does this matter beyond your parents or grandparents? Because financial institutions are on the front lines of this battle...and right now, they're struggling to keep up. Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, and Citibank have all introduced new fraud detection systems in recent years, but AI-powered scams seem to be outpacing those protections. In some cases, fraudsters use deepfake video calls to impersonate family members. Others spoof bank emails down to the last pixel. And the stakes are getting higher. What used to be one-off scams for a few hundred bucks are now turning into organized operations targeting entire savings accounts, retirement funds, and even home titles. And while the FBI is urging older adults to report crimes through ic3.gov , they acknowledge that many seniors feel too ashamed or confused to come forward. If that doesn't change, the losses will likely keep growing, and the tools scammers are using will only get more convincing. And that is exactly why I want my mom to keep forwarding me texts, emails or anything even remotely suspicious. I'll happily quadruple-check them for her every single time.

Lovecraft loved going up to the forested Scituate area to seek relief from the hustle and bustle of Providence and that is why he based his short story The Colour of Outer Space there, because the valley, now covered in nothing but a giant blue reservoir, holds sunken villages beneath their waves.

mov_2BE840E7F9BACF1709789A354D68F271,2025-07-08 23:47:25,en,WEB,"  Greycroft, the 19-year-old early-stage venture capital firm crossing consumer and technology, has been bolstering its consumer bench. After Katherine Power, who's had founding roles in Versed, Merit, Avaline and Who What Wear, became a partner in 2023, Brian Bustamante-Nicholson, former managing director at Sonoma Brands, where he led investments in Power's brands Merit and Avaline, came on board a year later as a partner as well. Now, Eric Ryan, founder of Cereal and co-founder of Welly Health, Olly and Method, has joined as the newest member of Greycroft's consumer brand team. Greycroft's consumer brand portfolio includes Mother Science, Experiment Beauty, Arey, Sisu and Seed Health, which Reuters reported last year was exploring a $1 billion sale. In partnership with L'Oréal's VC firm BOLD, it invested in Rembrand, an AI-powered product placement platform, and the makeup brand Ami Cole. All told, Greycroft has raised over $3 billion in capital and backed more than 400 brands. This year, Bustamante-Nicholson expects it to make five consumer brand investments. He was drawn to the firm to execute Power's consumer brand investment thesis marrying digital and operational prowess. “Greycroft being a venture firm with one foot in technology investing is a big advantage to an investor like me on the consumer side,” says Bustamante-Nicholson. “What we're able to do in terms of surfacing interesting technologies and companies within areas like AI that are helping brands in areas like marketing and logistics and payments is very unique. I can't think of another firm that has that kind of capability.” Beauty Independent spoke with him about the database of consultants Greycroft is assembling, the implications of the Agentic Web for brands, why he's eyeing the mass market more for potential investments and two overriding trends that inform his perspective. What brand stages do you focus on? The fund is focused on early stage. We are evolving our strategy into investing in growth-stage brands. That's where I spent the majority of my career. I've invested across everything from seed to very mature growth equity investments, but the opportunity I saw in the market that I've executed upon for the past seven years is identifying brands that have some quantifiable level of product-market fit. You're catching them at exciting inflection points where they might have a great direct-to-consumer business with an Amazon business and the opportunity to get into retail in a big way. What that typically means are businesses between $3 million and $20 million in revenue growing very fast, where they're a click below the size that the more established consumer private equity firms are investing, and where we feel like we can generate the best risk-adjusted returns. What I've learned in my career is you can solve for that product-market fit equation earlier and earlier as time goes on because of what's happened largely with technology and the amount of channels now that brands can succeed in. How do you validate product-market fit? It's two things. It's channel metrics and the financials. On the channel metrics, it's retail unit velocities, sell-through, the amount of doors. It's being able to look at the early signs to draw conclusions. Then, what we're finding more are businesses that have strong direct-to-consumer metrics—obviously, repeat purchase rate, retention, lifetime value to customer acquisition costs, if there's a subscription component to it. I always look for low ratio of paid marketing to revenue, typically that means spending below 20% of your total sales. Financial performance, meaning high gross margin structure, unit economics and a path to profitability. That's a powerful equation if you can tie all that together, sound financials and compelling channel metrics. We're finding businesses that can show some of those direct-to-consumer metrics early on, maybe show success on a third-party marketplace like Amazon or even TikTok Shop. That's a different world than say 10 years ago, obviously when the path to success was you had to keep knocking on the door of Sephora or Ulta to get placement there and then that would get more success potentially. They were king makers. Greycroft partner Brian Bustamante-Nicholson Robert Wright You mentioned inflection points. Does a brand have to have a purchase order from Sephora or Ulta for you to get involved? They're not prerequisites. Part of our value proposition is being able to identify brands that have the opportunity to show well in front of those retailers, but, secondly, to help them along in their journey to be successful in those retailers. What is important is us seeing a path into retail because I think the days of investing in purely direct brands are over. I don't think strategics particularly want a direct-to-consumer business. Rhode is an outlier. Dollar Shave Club and a few others have not turned out to be very successful acquisitions. Within beauty and wellness, what spaces are you especially looking at now? We're very excited about fragrance. We think there's a big opportunity there both at the prestige and mass levels. That's on the radar of everybody. It's still underdeveloped as in there's still a lot of opportunity there. We see a bunch of new brands focus largely at the prestige level, but it's early days, and we're not seeing a lot of folks going after the mass part of the market, which we think is the most attractive part of the market. Why is mass the most attractive part of the market to you? There's the most opportunity to build big brands for consumers there. Most of the innovation that happens with new entrepreneurs they're building at the prestige level...."

mov_CB25E3E9D530939EE4D2E75D8C0DDBC6,2025-07-09 01:50:43,en,WEB,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com One of John F. Kennedy Jr.'s famous exes has seemingly been cast in FX's American Love Story, as evidenced by new photos from the New York City set. Actress Dree Hemingway was spotted filming alongside Paul Kelly as John F. Kennedy Jr. for what appeared to be a date scene in New York City on Tuesday, which comes after their co-star Sarah Pidgeon had a terse response to haters. While neither Hemingway - the great-granddaughter of literary great Ernest Hemingway and daughter of actress Mariel Hemingway - nor the network has confirmed the casting, there appears to be one big tell. Hemingway was spotted wearing a dress that is strikingly similar to the one Hannah was spotted wearing while attending the Rhode Island wedding of JFK Jr.'s cousin Edward Kennedy Jr. in October 1993. Hannah and JFK Jr. dated for five years, after reconnecting at the 1988 wedding of his aunt Lee Radziwill, though they knew each other years earlier since their families had vacationed together in Saint Martin. After they broke up, JFK Jr. started dating Carolyn Bessette, who he would marry in 1996 before their tragic deaths in a plane crash off the coast of Cape Cod in 1999. Hemingway was spotted wearing a brown dress with unique patterns that's quite similar - but not identical - to the one Hannah wore to the 1993 Rhode Island wedding. She also wore a matching light brown coat over her dress and accessorizing with brown sunglasses and a small brown purse with her long blonde locks flowing over her shoulders. The actress completed her look with a pair of brown heeled boots for her day on the set, as she was seen kissing Kelly and getting out of a yellow NYC taxi cab. Kelly was spotted wearing a light brown dress shirt sans tie with a dark brown plaid suit coat over it for the scene. He completed his look with blue dress pants and brown shoes for his day on the set on Tuesday. Hemingway was also seen cutting loose with some impromptu dance moves between takes on the set. It's unclear if the show plans on re-creating the 1993 wedding or if the scenes they're shooting are from a different point and time in JFK Jr.' and Hannah's relationship. Hemingway joins a cast that also includes Sarah Pidgeon as Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, Naomi Watts as Jackie Kennedy, Grace Gummer as Caroline Kennedy, Alessandro Nivola as Calvin Klein (who Bessette worked for), Leila George as Calvin's daughter Kelly, Sydney Lemmon as Caroline's sister Lauren, who also died in the tragic plane crash, and Noah Fearnley as Michael Bergen, Caroline's ex who alleged that they continued a sexual relationship while she was married to JFK Jr. Fans have already been bashing American Love Story creator Ryan Murphy for wardrobe and fashion choices. Murphy responded to the fickle fans in an interview with Variety, stating they are doing the same thing to actress Sarah Paulson that media and others did to the real Carolyn Bessette. 'There were comments like, ""I hate that coat, Carolyn would have never worn that. That was just a coat we threw on for color. People are writing ""How dare you use the No. 35 Birkin bag? She wore a 40! "" Yes we have a 40 but we just threw on a bag from another costume department because that was the sound stage we were on,' he said. 'They're doing to our Carolyn, what they did to the real-life Carolyn. It's not fair,' Ryan added to Variety."

The team of scientists and explorers aboard Exploration Vessel Nautilus located and imaged the bow blown off the World War II heavy cruiser USS New Orleans for the first time on July 6, 2025. Using Ocean Exploration Trust's ROVs to investigate a target found during seafloor mapping operations by University of New Hampshire's uncrewed surface vessel DriX, the team found the bow resting at ~675 meters deep in the Solomon Islands' Iron Bottom Sound and reilluminated this improbable story. During the November 1942 Battle of Tassafaronga, offshore of Guadalcanal, USS New Orleans was hit by a Japanese 'Long Lance' torpedo, catastrophically detonating the forward magazines and tearing off nearly one-third of the ship, including the bow. The explosion killed over 180 crew. Bow-less and flooding, New Orleans was heroically saved by crew members, who stayed at their posts and saved their ship but not themselves, receiving three posthumous Navy Crosses. The ship limped back to the nearby harbor, where, using coconut logs, the crew was able to stabilize New Orleans well enough to sail backward to the United States for permanent repairs. Over eighty years later, the team imaged the site with onboard archaeologists and experts from all former combatant nations contributing via livestreaming telepresence. Together, this team spotted details in the ship's structure, painting, and anchor to positively identify the wreckage as New Orleans. Led by OET President and famed explorer Dr. Robert Ballard, the Maritime Archaeology of Guadalcanal expedition, exploring historically significant shipwrecks in the Iron Bottom Sound is supported by NOAA Ocean Exploration via the Ocean Exploration Cooperative Institute. This exploration is made possible by the expertise, support, and collaboration of many partners, including NOAA Ocean Exploration, U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command, Solomon Islands government, the University of New Hampshire Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping/Joint Hydrographic Center, University of Rhode Island, and Japanese, Australian, and New Zealand colleagues. Exploration Vessel Nautilus is exploring unknown regions of the ocean seeking out new discoveries while pushing the boundaries of STEAM education and technological innovation.

I own a multi-family property, and I was told I now need to either abate the lead paint or install new siding in order to rent legally, especially if I want to rent to Section 8. Problem is, I'm broke. Like seriously. I've been scraping by doing Uber and side jobs just to pay the mortgage. Now I'm being told I need to spend thousands on siding just to keep things legal. I don't have that kind of money lying around. Anyone else in the same boat? Has anyone found a cheaper workaround or got help with this? I'm open to hearing anything, grants, loans, DIY tips, community programs, whatever. I'm not trying to cut corners, I just want to survive this without going into debt or losing the property."

Per Bloody Disgusting , 2013's The Conjuring is about to receive the 4K Ultra HD and 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray treatment courtesy of New Line Cinema. Although the 4K Ultra HD release will be a purely digital purchase, it will still offer all the same special features and new bonus content as the full 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray version of the film. Among the new additions to the bonus features available with both versions of the film are a Scariest of Them All segment in which the original cast and creators look back at The Conjuring 's biggest scares, as well as a Reflections on The Conjuring segment covering the cast and crew's experiences with the franchise over the past 12 years. Related James Gunn Names Which Obscure Batman Character Would Get an 'Instant Green Light' for a DCU Project DC Studios co-head James Gunn opens up about the one obscure comic book character he wants to bring into the mix in a Batman film. Posts 3 Loosely based on the real lives of Ed and Lorraine Warren, whose experiences served as the basis for The Amityville Horror and its own feature film franchise, The Conjuring was directed by Wan from a screenplay by twins Chad and Carey W. Hayes. The film stars Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as Lorraine and Ed, with the film opening to the couple in the midst of their 1968 investigation into the purportedly possessed Annabelle doll . With their reputations as paranormal investigators already cemented, it is only a matter of time before The Conjuring jumps forward three years and drops the Warrens into the middle of another horrifying mystery. The Conjuring was a massive success upon its release, bringing in over $319.5 million at the global box office against a $20 million budget. Since then, The Conjuring Universe has spun out into multiple directions , with seven sequels, prequels, and spin-offs to date, not to mention two unofficial spinoffs in the forms of Wolves at the Door and The Curse of La Llorona , both of which see The Conjuring Universe characters appear despite not being tied directly into the same events. As a whole, The Conjuring Universe franchise has made more than $2 billion, and it might not be slowing down any time soon.

While discussing the upcoming film, Brener stated that ""While this is last of what we call phase one, we are hopeful that we can make more."" When asked to clarify if that meant a ""phase two"" was already in the works at New Line Cinema, Brener replied, ""Phase two is TBD.""

Set in 1971, The Conjuring involves Roger and Caroly Perron who, upon moving into a farmhouse in Rhode Island with their family, discover that their home is haunted. Things start slow, with small warnings that would pique the attention of any supernatural expert. Of course, the Parrons have no idea what they are up against until things go from bad to worse and it is clear that an evil spirit is involved. It is then that the couple gets in touch with demonologists Ed and Lorraine, who are agree to take the case. After an initial investigation, it is clear that there are spirits in the house and that some of them are malicious. The history of the house becomes key to both unraveling the mystery of the haunting and saving the Parron children, who seem to be targeted by the spirit. Meanwhile, Ed and Lorraine are also determined to record the experience in order to provide proof of the supernatural. Can the Warrens figure out the identity of the spirit and save the Parron family, and themselves, before it's too late?"

Dan McKee's job approval numbers have plummeted in the last year, according to the latest findings by the Pell Center at Salve Regina University. 2. More than two-thirds of Rhode Island voters are skeptical of the McKee administration's pledge to complete the new Washington Bridge by November 2028 at a budgeted cost of $427 million. 3. The degree to which Rhode Island Democrats and Republicans disagree ""on whether the economy is thriving or in a recession is alarming,"" to the point where Pell Center Associate Director and Fellow Katie Sonder said it's ""as if we are living in parallel realities."" The survey of 804 registered Rhode Island voters was conducted for the Pell Center between June 16-22 by Embold Research via text message and ""targeted advertisements using the Meta advertising platform."" The potential margin of error is 3.6%, but few of the findings were close enough for that to matter. A year out from the 2026 elections, Democrat McKee's job approval has dropped to 25%. A Pell Center poll from a year ago, in June 2024, found his job approval at 36%. The drop is not quite as precipitous as what a University of New Hampshire poll found in May. That poll placed McKee's job-approval at 19%. Among Democrats, 42% at least ""somewhat"" approve of his performance and 45% do not. When asked about the finding, Rod Silverstein, McKee's campaign manager, had this to say: ""Polls come and go – what matters is the work. From breaking ground on new community learning centers across our state, to the opening of Amazon's new facility, and preparing to complete our new state health lab – Governor McKee is focused on delivering results for Rhode Islanders."" Anyway you parse it, it is not great news for a governor facing a likely Democratic primary challenge from Helena Foulkes, the ubiquitous millionaire he barely beat in the 2022 primary, and potentially others – including House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi. The latest Pell Center poll did not probe the reasons, but the Washington Bridge question clearly hit a nerve among Rhode Island voters who have lived through the saga. At first, the Department of Transportation attributed the damage to a sudden impact or large truck and suggested the bridge could be repaired in three months. But records, subsequently obtained by The Journal, showed: professional engineers had been warning about the condition of the bridge and urging repairs for a decade. The Pell Center posed this question: ""Rhode Island state officials estimate that the Washington Bridge will be rebuilt by November 2028 and cost $427 million to rebuild. In your opinion, how likely do you think the project will be completed within this timeframe and budget?"" The response? 25% said ""not that likely,"" and 59% said ""not likely at all."" For the record: Lieutenant Governor Sabina Matos' job approval rating stood at 22%; Attorney General Neronha's at 38%; General Treasurer James Diossa's at 29% and Secretary of State Gregg Amore's at 29%. Within Rhode Island's all-Democrat Congressional delegation, only U.S. Sen. Jack Reed hit the 50% mark. From the proposed assault weapons ban to the health of democracy, Rhode Island's Republicans and Democrats appear to exist in two different worlds. The proposed ""assault weapons ban"" was opposed by 81% of Republicans and favored by 85% of Democrats. On the bigger, broader question about the health of democracy and the economy, which had been a hot-button election year issue: Three-quarters of Republicans (76%) believe it is thriving, while 73% of Democrats believe we are in a recession. Only 17% of those polled chose the economy as one of the top three most important issues facing the country. More than half of Republicans named immigration (58%) as a top issue, while Democrats chose Trump and the Republicans (66%) and the state of democracy (36%) as main concerns. Perhaps even more striking: Two thirds of those surveyed believe the United States is facing a constitutional crisis (64%). Democrats overwhelmingly believe this (94%), compared to only 27% of Republicans and 55% of Independents. About a third (37%) believe the country has fallen into dictatorship. Among Democrats, 64% believe that; only 4% of Republicans. “In a way, it's not surprising to see Republicans now have a healthier outlook because, historically in national data, positive outlooks swell when the executive branch is controlled by the supported party,"" Sonder said. ""But the degree to which the parties disagree, including on whether the economy is thriving or in a recession, is alarming."" ""I will be interested to see how [Independents] shape Rhode Island politics, since the group represents the majority of registered voters and holds varying political opinions, some of which lean left and some of which lean right,"" Sonder said. For state-specific issues, job performance approval ratings for three of Rhode Island's four Congressional representatives dipped between June 2024 and June 2025. Representative Gabe Amo saw a 2 percentage point increase in net approval (+11), though Senator Jack Reed holds the highest net approval rating (+12)."

To start their own flock, through the city's code enforcement department. Fifty permits, at $50 each, will be valid for two years, when municipal leaders will reevaluate the program. To be eligible, applicants must live in a single-family home they own, which is not part of a homeowner's association, and they must also complete a chicken-care course endorsed by the city. So far, the city has received 12 applications. AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement Check out what you need to know before diving into the increasingly popular venture, which has become more than just a hipster trend. How many chickens do I need for a dozen eggs a week? Well, for now at least, Palm Coast is permitting up to four chickens per house — hens only, no roosters. A small flock of three to four hens will usually provide a dozen eggs per week, or even more during peak laying season, according to HappyChickenCoop.com. This is also considered a good number to start with for beginners. Green America notes on its website that ""the number allows for a social dynamic within the flock, while not being too overwhelming for a novice chicken keeper. It's also a manageable number for providing adequate space and resources."" What chicken breed is best for a backyard? Several sources recommend, first of all, going for chicks, especially if you're a novice. You can get chicks as young as one day old from some farms or growers. AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement The website HomeInTheFingerLakes.com recommends ""easygoing hens for families with children or anyone who wants a friendly flock are Buff Orpington, Australorps, Sussex, Cochins and Brahmas. These birds are known to be docile in temperament and enjoy human company."" Most of the chicken breeds named also do well in the Florida climate. Varieties known to produce the most eggs include Eghorn, Rhode Island Red and Plymouth Rock, according to HappyChickenCoop.com. How expensive are backyard chickens? How much does it cost monthly to raise chickens? The monthly cost of raising backyard chickens varies, but a typical range is $25–$50. This includes feed ($2–$3 per chicken, totaling $15–$30 for a small flock), bedding ($5–$10) and miscellaneous expenses ($5–$20), according to Green America. How do I make a coop and how much will it cost me? In Palm Coast, the city prohibits coops and enclosures larger than 100 square feet or higher than 6 feet. Prices can vary from hundreds of dollars to $1,000. AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement The coop must be in the rear of the property, with a minimum of a 10-foot rear setback and 7-1/2-foot side setbacks. A fence separating your property from a neighbor's is required so the chickens don't go wandering or become easy prey. A fly-proof bin must be set up to collect manure, at least 20 feet from neighbors' property lines, according to the newly passed Palm Coast ordinance. What are some other towns in the Daytona Beach region that allow chickens? Local ordinances may differ in their rules, as well as the permitting process, so be sure to check with your own municipality about restrictions before planning your coop.

The potential margin of error is 3.6%, but few of the findings were close enough for that to matter. Link to Image What did the poll find? A year out from the 2026 elections, Democrat McKee's job approval has dropped to 25%. A Pell Center poll from a year ago, in June 2024, found his job approval at 36%. The drop is not quite as precipitous as what a University of New Hampshire poll found in May. That poll placed McKee's job-approval at 19%. Among Democrats, 42% at least ""somewhat"" approve of his performance and 45% do not. When asked about the finding, Rod Silverstein, McKee's campaign manager, had this to say: ""Polls come and go – what matters is the work. From breaking ground on new community learning centers across our state, to the opening of Amazon's new facility, and preparing to complete our new state health lab – Governor McKee is focused on delivering results for Rhode Islanders."" What does it mean? Anyway you parse it, it is not great news for a governor facing a likely Democratic primary challenge from Helena Foulkes, the ubiquitous millionaire he barely beat in the 2022 primary, and potentially others – including House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi. The latest Pell Center poll did not probe the reasons, but the Washington Bridge question clearly hit a nerve among Rhode Island voters who have lived through the saga. At first, the Department of Transportation attributed the damage to a sudden impact or large truck and suggested the bridge could be repaired in three months. But records, subsequently obtained by The Journal, showed: professional engineers had been warning about the condition of the bridge and urging repairs for a decade. The Pell Center posed this question: ""Rhode Island state officials estimate that the Washington Bridge will be rebuilt by November 2028 and cost $427 million to rebuild. In your opinion, how likely do you think the project will be completed within this timeframe and budget?"" The response? 25% said ""not that likely,"" and 59% said ""not likely at all."" For the record: Lieutenant Governor Sabina Matos' job approval rating stood at 22%; Attorney General Neronha's at 38%; General Treasurer James Diossa's at 29% and Secretary of State Gregg Amore's at 29%. Within Rhode Island's all-Democrat Congressional delegation, only U.S. Sen. Jack Reed hit the 50% mark. Going deeper: Poll finds startling divide between Democrats, Republicans From the proposed assault weapons ban to the health of democracy, Rhode Island's Republicans and Democrats appear to exist in two different worlds. The proposed ""assault weapons ban"" was opposed by 81% of Republicans and favored by 85% of Democrats. On the bigger, broader question about the health of democracy and the economy, which had been a hot-button election year issue: Three-quarters of Republicans (76%) believe it is thriving, while 73% of Democrats believe we are in a recession. Only 17% of those polled chose the economy as one of the top three most important issues facing the country. More than half of Republicans named immigration (58%) as a top issue, while Democrats chose Trump and the Republicans (66%) and the state of democracy (36%) as main concerns. Perhaps even more striking: Two thirds of those surveyed believe the United States is facing a constitutional crisis (64%). Democrats overwhelmingly believe this (94%), compared to only 27% of Republicans and 55% of Independents. About a third (37%) believe the country has fallen into dictatorship. Among Democrats, 64% believe that; only 4% of Republicans. “In a way, it's not surprising to see Republicans now have a healthier outlook because, historically in national data, positive outlooks swell when the executive branch is controlled by the supported party,"" Sonder said. ""But the degree to which the parties disagree, including on whether the economy is thriving or in a recession, is alarming."" ""I will be interested to see how [Independents] shape Rhode Island politics, since the group represents the majority of registered voters and holds varying political opinions, some of which lean left and some of which lean right,"" Sonder said. For state-specific issues, job performance approval ratings for three of Rhode Island's four Congressional representatives dipped between June 2024 and June 2025. Representative Gabe Amo saw a 2 percentage point increase in net approval (+11), though Senator Jack Reed holds the highest net approval rating (+12). This article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: A year out from the 2026 election, new poll finds McKee's job approval slipping. What to know."
mov_A2D8CC736AC52E156E7FA42BBFC11DC4,2025-07-09 10:03:00,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Las estrellas usan su fama para crear prósperos negocios, según el semanario británico. Desde bebidas gaseosas y calzado hasta fragancias, a lo largo de los años los famosos han vendido de todo. En el pasado, la mayoría de las estrellas se conformaban con prestar sus rostros a campañas publicitarias a cambio de un poco de dinero extra. Algunos más emprendedores fueron un paso más allá y participaban en el diseño de los productos que promocionaban. En los años 80, un encuentro casual en un avión entre Jane Birkin, actriz británica, y un alto ejecutivo de Hermès, una marca de lujo, dio lugar a la creación del bolso Birkin. Por la misma época, Michael Jordan, la estrella del basquetbol, se asoció con Nike, una marca deportiva, para lanzar la línea de zapatillas deportivas Air Jordan. Sin embargo, más recientemente un número creciente de famosos ha optado por crear empresas de consumo propias. En la última década, los famosos, desde Beyoncé y Rihanna hasta George Clooney y Harry Styles, han lanzado líneas de belleza, marcas de bebidas alcohólicas, de ropa y mucho más. Un estudio realizado en 2023 por la empresa inmobiliaria JLL reveló que alrededor de tres quintas partes de las marcas minoristas de famosos en Estados Unidos se habían fundado en los seis años anteriores. Desde entonces, la tendencia ha continuado a buen ritmo, con la participación de estrellas como Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (cuidado de la piel masculina) y Emma Watson (ginebra), sir David Beckham (suplementos) y Wiz Khalifa (kits para cultivar setas). En mayo, Hailey Bieber, esposa de Justin Bieber, estrella del pop, vendió su marca de maquillaje Rhode a la firma de cosméticos e.l.f. Beauty por nada menos que US$ 1,000 millones. A medida que se difumina la frontera entre el comercio minorista y las redes sociales, los famosos están remodelando el mundo de los bienes de consumo. La proliferación de marcas de famosos es en parte un reflejo de los cambios en la industria de los medios de comunicación. En décadas pasadas, comunicarse con los consumidores estaba intermediado en gran medida por un puñado de canales de televisión, emisoras de radio y publicaciones impresas. Ya no. Hoy en día, dice Douglas Holt, un gurú de la mercadotecnia, cada cuenta de las redes sociales es un canal propio. Esto ha permitido a los famosos relacionarse directamente con sus fans. Kim Kardashian tiene más de 350 millones de seguidores en Instagram. A menudo usa Skims y habla de ellos en línea. “Kim es una directora creativa fenomenal”, dice Jens Grede, su cofundador, “pero también es una potencia mediática en solitario”. Según Launchmetrics, una empresa de análisis, el año pasado Skims generó más de US$ 600 millones en “valor de impacto mediático”, un indicador del beneficio monetario de las publicaciones online, la cobertura de prensa y otros tipos de exposición mediática. Esta cifra es ocho veces superior a la de Spanx, una marca rival de ropa moldeadora. Ahora los famosos no solo pueden comunicarse directamente con sus admiradores. También pueden venderles directamente. Las marcas emergentes ya no necesitan vender a través de grandes minoristas, que se llevan una parte de los beneficios, ni abrir tiendas físicas, lo que supone una enorme inversión inicial. Para vender en línea, ni siquiera necesitan pasar por plataformas de comercio electrónico como Amazon. Las herramientas como las que ofrece Shopify, una empresa de software canadiense, han facilitado más que nunca la creación de un sitio de comercio electrónico o una aplicación móvil. Las plataformas de redes sociales como TikTok también permiten ahora a las marcas vender directamente a los usuarios. Las ventas directas al consumidor han aumentado hasta representar alrededor de una séptima parte del comercio electrónico mundial, según NIQ, un proveedor de datos. Anita Balchandani, de la consultora McKinsey, calcula que representan hasta el 100% de los ingresos en los primeros días de una marca típica de famosos, y que descienden al 30%-60% a medida que las empresas se expanden y añaden la distribución por terceros. Por supuesto, no todas las marcas de famosos despegan. The Honest Company, fabricante de productos de belleza y para bebés cofundada por la actriz Jessica Alba, ha perdido tres cuartas partes de su valor de mercado desde que cotizó en bolsa en 2021. Alex Griffin, jefe de mercadotecnia de On, una marca de ropa deportiva que visten el tenista Roger Federer y la actriz Zendaya, dice que hay una razón por la que muchas estrellas siguen optando por los patrocinios en lugar de crear sus propias marcas: “No es tan fácil”. Elegir el tipo de producto adecuado es importante. La ropa y la bebida son cosas que la gente suele comprar por lo que simbolizan, más que por su funcionalidad, dice Sandra Cariglio, de ReD Associates, una empresa de asesoría. Eso los convierte en apuestas más seguras para los famosos. Naturalmente, a las estrellas atractivas también les resulta fácil vender productos de belleza. Ayuda que la producción de cosméticos sea fácil de subcontratar a fabricantes de marca blanca, como ocurre con las fragancias. Jill Avery, de la Harvard Business School, añade que los productos tienen que “encajar” con la propia marca del famoso. Las fans compran maquillaje a Hailey Bieber porque lleva mucho tiempo compartiendo consejos de belleza en Internet, y ropa moldeadora a Kim Kardashian porque es conocida por sus curvas. Cuando se le pregunta por qué lanza una aplicación para correr, Mo Farah, atleta con cuatro medallas de oro olímpicas a sus espaldas, dice sencillamente a The Economist: “Es lo único que sé”. Aun así, algunos famosos parecen capaces de vender cualquier cosa. Ryan Reynolds, estrella de comedias románticas convertido en superhéroe malhablado, se convirtió en 2019 en el rostro de Mint Mobile, una empresa de telecomunicaciones, tras adquirir alrededor del 25% del negocio. El año pasado, T-Mobile, un rival mayor, compró la empresa matriz de Mint por unos US$ 1,300 millones. En 2021, Reynolds se hizo con el Wrexham A.F.C., un equipo de fútbol galés en apuros, por 2 millones de libras (US$ 2.7 millones) junto con otro actor. La mejora en los resultados del equipo —y un documental ganador de un premio Emmy coproducido por Reynolds— han aumentado considerablemente su fama. Ahora se dice que el club está recaudando dinero con una valoración de hasta 350 millones de libras. Para los famosos que se dedican a los bienes de consumo, tener un producto decente es esencial. La atención en línea de la que gozan las marcas de famosos viene acompañada de un escrutinio añadido. Goop, una marca de estilo de vida fundada por Gwyneth Paltrow, actriz ganadora de un Oscar, ha sido atacada por hacer afirmaciones sin base científica sobre sus productos...."

mov_A081DE41BDDAE6ADD6D853D6F1560B72,2025-07-09 11:00:07,en,WEB,"  Activists in Seattle gather signatures to put a social housing initiative on the ballot. In early 2025, voters passed the measure, which implements a payroll tax on high incomes to fund the program. House Our Neighbors, CC BY-SA by Susanne Schindler, Harvard Kennedy School Seattle astounded housing advocates around the country in February 2025, when roughly two-thirds of voters approved a ballot initiative proposing a new 5% payroll tax on salaries in excess of US$1 million. The expected revenue – estimated to amount to $52 million dollars annually – would go toward funding a public development authority named Seattle Social Housing, which would then build and maintain permanently affordable homes. The city has experienced record high rents and home prices over the past two decades, attributed in part to the high incomes and relatively low taxes paid by tech firms like Amazon. Prior attempts to make these companies do their part to keep the city affordable have had mixed results. So despite nationwide, bipartisan skepticism of government and tax increases, Seattle's voters showed that in light of a severe affordability crisis, a new role for the public sector and a new, dedicated fiscal revenue stream for housing were not only necessary, but possible. As a trained architect and urban historian, I study how capitalist societies have embraced – or rejected – housing that's permanently shielded from market forces and what that means for architecture and urban design. To me, Seattle's social housing initiative shows that the country's traditional, “either-or” housing model – of unregulated, market-rate housing versus tightly regulated, income-restricted affordable housing – has reached its limits. Social housing promises a different path forward. The rise of the 'two-tiered' system After World War I, amid a similarly dire housing crisis, journalist Catherine Bauer traveled to Europe and learned about the continent's social housing programs. She publicized her findings in the 1934 book “Modern Housing,” in which she advocated for housing that would be permanently shielded from the private real estate market. High-quality design was central to her argument. (The book was reissued in 2020, reflecting a renewed hunger for her ideas.) Early New Deal programs supported “limited-dividend,” or nonprofit, housing sponsored by civic organizations such as labor unions. The Carl Mackley Houses in Philadelphia exemplified this approach: The government provided low-interest loans to the American Federation of Full-Fashioned Hosiery Workers, which then constructed housing for its workers with rents set at affordable rates. The complex was built with community rooms and a swimming pool for its residents. Financed by $1.2 million in federal funds, the Carl Mackley Houses, completed in 1935, provided homes for union workers. Alfred Kastner papers, Collection No. 7350, Box 45, Record 12, American Heritage Center, University of Wyoming However, the 1937 U.S. Housing Act omitted this form of middle-income housing. Instead, the federal government chose to support public rental housing for low-income Americans and private homeownership, with little in between. Historian Gail Radford has aptly termed this a “two-tiered system,” and it was problematic from the start. Funding for public housing in the U.S. – as well as for its successor, private-sector-built affordable housing – has always been capped in ways that fall far short of demand, with access to the homes largely restricted to households with the lowest incomes. Private-sector-built affordable housing depends on dangling tax credits for private investors, and rent restrictions can expire. While the U.S. promoted this two-tiered system, cities like Vienna pursued a different path. In Austria's culturally vibrant capital, today half of all dwellings are permanently removed from the private market. Roughly 80% of households qualify to live in them. The buildings take a range of forms, are located in all neighborhoods, and are built and operated as rental or cooperative housing either by the city or by nonprofit developers. Rents do not rise and fall according to household income, but are instead set to cover capital and operation expenses. These are kept low thanks to long-term, low-interest loans. These loans are funded through a nationwide 1% payroll tax, split evenly between employers and employees. Renters also make a down payment, priced in relation to the size and age of the apartment, which keeps monthly rents down. To guarantee access to low-cost land, the municipality has pursued an active land acquisition policy since the 1980s. Vienna's Pilotengasse Housing Estate, a social housing development featuring low-rise buildings with abundant greenery, was completed in 1992 and serves a range of income groups. Viennaslide/Construction Photography/Avalon/ Housing shielded from the private market The inequities created by the two-tiered system – along with the absence of viable options for moderate- and middle-income households – are what social housing advocates in the U.S. are trying to address today. In 2018, the think tank People's Policy Project published what was likely the first 21st-century report advocating for social housing in the U.S., citing Vienna as a model. Across the U.S., social housing is being used to describe a range of programs, from limited equity cooperatives and community land trusts to public housing. They all share a few underlying principles, however. First and foremost, social housing calls for permanently shielding homes from the private real estate market, often referred to as “permanent affordability.” This usually means public investment in housing and public ownership of it. Second, unlike the ways in which public housing has traditionally operated in the U.S., most social housing programs aim to serve households across a broader range of incomes. The goal is to create housing that is both financially sustainable and appealing to broad swaths of the electorate. Third, social housing aspires to give residents more control over the governance of their homes. Social housing doesn't all look the same. But thoughtful design is key to its success...."

From Hawaii to New York, Texas up to Minnesota, there are plenty of options. But, of course, some states have more on tap than others. Anybody checking in with this website is likely familiar with the traditional hot spots. Florida, Arizona, California, both of the Carolinas as examples – each is frequently considered a golf heavyweight depending on seasonality and personal preference in style of course. But when breaking down the Golfweek's Best ranking data and comparing each state, there are plenty of surprises, especially for golfers who might not have been paying attention to development trends in recent years. If you know, you know, but it's still a fun exercise to crunch the numbers and see how the states stack up and which defy traditional expectations. For this comparison, we looked at three of Golfweek's Best most popular lists, each published in June of 2025. They include the ranking of top public-access courses in each state, the ranking of top private courses in each state and the ranking of the Top 100 Best Courses You Can Play, which reveals the greatest public-access courses across the country. The details: How we rank golf courses In those two rankings of public and private courses in each state, we averaged the Golfweek's Best rating of just the top five courses in each state possible to establish a comparison of elite courses. (A few states have only four courses ranked in either the public or private rankings, so in those cases the four are averaged.) By looking at the comparisons of elite public-access and private courses, we can get a handle on what are the real golf hot spots in the United States. To take it further, we pulled the data on the top 100 public-access courses in the U.S. by state. Not every state has a course on that list, which is dominated by just 16 states. Three states have nine courses among the top 100 public-access courses in the country, and two of those three states might be a surprise to some readers. In all, just 16 states are home to 81 percent of the entire list. Some of the results are predictable, and some are eye-opening. The takeaway: If you never try something new, you'll miss out on a lot of great golf. Sunny stalwarts such as California, Florida and Hawaii are expected to score highly in comparison to other states, and they do. But which states offer the best elite courses, using the average of the top five courses in each state as a measuring stick? To anybody who has visited Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, the No. 1 state shouldn't be a surprise. Oregon sits atop the list purely on the strength of Bandon Dunes Golf Resort's five full-size courses: Pacific Dunes, Bandon Trails, Old Macdonald, Bandon Dunes and Sheep Ranch. The Sheep Ranch is rated by Golfweek's Best as the No. 5 course in the state and at the coastal resort with a 7.66 average rating on the Golfweek's Best 10-point scale, but it would be the highest-rated public-access course in 42 states. No. 2 among the elite public golf states might be a greater surprise to some. Wisconsin jumps to that elevated spot, led by the Straits Course at Kohler's Whistling Straits and buoyed further by the four courses at Sand Valley Resort to round out the state's top five public-access layouts. And this exercise compares only those top five, when in reality Wisconsin's great golf runs much deeper. Its next five courses – Erin Hills, Lawsonia Links, the River Course at Kohler's Blackwolf Run, the Irish Course at Kohler's Whistling Straits and SentryWorld – would have Wisconsin ranked No. 8 on this list of elite golf states. The golf season might be short in the Badger State, but it's not to be missed. The rest of the top 10 elite states for public-access golf probably would be considered more predictable, with a few exceptions – we see you hiding there in plain sight, Michigan and Washington.

Riverdale Park, Maryland, is just over 1.5 square miles from end to end. You could pass through it on your way out of College Park or Hyattsville and not even realize you've entered a separate neighborhood. And yet, the small town along the Route 1 corridor has an impressive list of amenities that distinguishes it from its better known neighbors: a vibrant town square with a MARC train stop, a yoga studio and a weekly farmers market. A 19th-century mansion-turned-museum that's on the National Register of Historic Places. A mixed-use shopping center with luxury apartments and a local brewery. And a Latin-influenced, Texas-style barbecue joint with the most sought-after brisket in the D.C. region. With 7,200 residents, locals say the town's diversity has created a rich tapestry of food, music and traditions from all over the world. More than 37 percent of residents are immigrants, more than half are Hispanic, and more than 20 percent identify as Black, per Census data. “It's just this eclectic group of different nationalities and races and people coming together in a town that is growing up before our very eyes,” said Mayor Ifiok Inyang, a son of Nigerian immigrants who was elected in May. Riverdale Park is a small town that's just hitting its adolescence, he said, which hasn't come without its growing pains. He and his wife, Naa, and their son were among a wave of young families that moved to the neighborhood after Prince George's County's first Whole Foods opened there in 2017. As the former council member for Ward 4 (the town has six), Inyang witnessed the tension between the old and the new. Some residents welcomed the “Whole Foods effect” — the grocer and its surrounding development, The Station, attracted trendy spots like Mod Pizza, District Taco and Denizens Brewery — while others haven't been as thrilled with the changes. “Housing has always been at a crunch,” Inyang said. “Very quickly it's like, 'We need more.' But then what does that look like when you still have residents who've been here 30, 40 years, and they very much appreciate the super small-town vibe?” Inyang said that despite the push for new development, Riverdale Park is still the type of place where you can go to the local bakery and run into a neighbor. One recent Saturday morning proved this to be true, at least at Manifest Bread, a bakery and cafe that closed for renovations about a year ago and reopened in May. Manifest is in the main strip of businesses right off the Rhode Island Avenue Trolley Trail, a retired streetcar line that's now a popular bike path and host of an annual festival. Even as heavy rain poured, customers waited in a line that snaked out onto the sidewalk, then chatted over cardamom buns and lattes. Rick Cook, who owns the shop with his wife, Tyes, greeted guests, several of whom lit up when they saw him. “It's not uncommon to see a lot of people that you know,” said Cook, who lives nearby with Tyes and their two sons. “This does really have kind of a small town feel to it.” The homes are a mix of 1920s all-wood Victorians, bungalows, apartments, townhouses and Sears kit homes, generally valued between $450,000 to $550,000 according to Alex Heitkemper, a real estate agent with Long & Foster who sells homes in the area. “It's a good place for first-time home buyers to look,” Heitkemper said. “It's a unique, quaint area.” One of the biggest and perhaps most unexpected draws to the neighborhood, he said, is its barbecue — that is, 2Fifty Texas BBQ, the smokehouse that Texas Monthly called one of the best in the country. Husband-and-wife duo Fernando Gonzalez and Debby Portillo started 2Fifty at the farmers market, selling brisket and ribs under a tent and building loyalty that they say still fuels their success. Those loyal customers supported them when the pandemic hit six months after they opened their brick and mortar at the former Dumm's Corner Market — a stone's throw from the farmers market — and had to shift to takeout only. Five years later, the couple, originally from El Salvador, continue to supplement their menu with produce from the farmers market, they said. And after every Thursday shift, their crew walks across the street to the market to grab dinner from a Mexican street food vendor. “Riverdale Park has been very welcoming,” Portillo said. “From the very first day, people wanted to know why we chose here, and because we have chosen here, 'Let's support you,' right?” They've since expanded 2Fifty to D.C.'s Mount Vernon neighborhood, but there's something special about the original spot, where they know regulars who've been there from the start, Gonzales said. “We enjoy that direct connection with our customers,” he said. “I don't think I will be happy if I'm not able to check on a table and ask you, 'How's your order? How's the brisket tasting, how's your tamales?'” Other culinary treasures can be found in Riverdale Park. Two local taquerias are considered part of Maryland's “taco triangle.” Local-favorite Banana Blossom Bistro closed in 2022 but reopened last year, serving up Vietnamese comfort food. And Riviera Tapas Bar is packed during dinner service, offering tacos, shareable plates and cocktails. On warm evenings, locals gather on the patio of Town Center Market, a massive liquor store that serves craft beers on tap. The owner, Greek-born Pete Spiropoulos, is the landlord for most of the real estate on the block, which includes 2Fifty. He purchased the property in 1988 and will tell anyone who listens that he had a hand in Riverdale Park's current status as a desirable place to live, work and play. From the desk in his office, Spiropoulos explained the history of the neighborhood — how it went from a sleepy, blue-collar town to a well-connected suburb with a lot of buzz. “It changed a lot in the past 37 years,” he said. “The property values went up crazy.” Some things haven't changed. For instance, most residents can tell you about the town's history, including that of the Riversdale House Museum, a mansion with ties to the Calvert family that helped found the Maryland colony and had a hand in creating the Maryland Agricultural College (later the University of Maryland)...."

mov_943F0B5856F14DDFE0DA222B0AC703DB,2025-07-09 13:03:18,en,WEB,"  Despite its roots as a recreational pursuit of the elite, modern-day tennis is about as close to a meritocracy as you'll find in professional sports. Whether it's Wimbledon or the lowest-rung tournament in tennis' minor leagues, there aren't any shortcuts to getting in. You qualify based on accomplishment. You can only advance to the next level by winning. You eat what you kill. You get what you deserve. And you are what your ranking says you are. Unless, of course, you're billionaire hedge fund guy Bill Ackman. On Wednesday afternoon, the 59-year old founder of Pershing Square Capital Management will suit up at the Hall of Fame Open in Newport, Rhode Island, indulging his sports fantasy while making a mockery of the tournament and the ATP Challenger Tour where players strive to eke out a living. ""I am playing the best tennis of my life,"" Ackman wrote last week on X, where he posts frequently about politics and is often far-too-eager to embrace ridiculous conspiracy theories. Including the idea that he belongs in a pro tennis event. Ackman's enthusiasm for tennis is indisputable. He's a bit of a gadfly on tour, befriending several players and helping bankroll the Professional Tennis Players Association when it was launched in 2019 by Novak Djokovic and Vasek Pospisil. He says he practices nearly every day, seems to be in good shape for a 59-year old and, because of his access to top players, has found himself on the other side of the net from all-time greats like Roger Federer in informal hitting sessions. And still, there is no deeper story to what's happening in Newport this week other than exactly what it looks like: A wealthy tennis benefactor who started playing seriously a decade ago using his privilege to say he competed in a pro tour event. We can be honest about how gross that is – both in Ackman's desire to make it happen and the ATP's willingness to humor him. How did it happen? According to Ackman's social media posts, former Wimbledon finalist Nick Kyrgios had proposed playing doubles together at one point, but ongoing injury issues delayed their partnership indefinitely. ""Fortunately fate intervened,"" Ackman wrote. Of course, it's not fate. It's simply the privilege of being Bill Ackman. Let's explain. Even though entrants for every tournament on the ATP or Challenger Tour level must meet a rankings threshold or earn a spot through a qualifying event, every tournament reserves a handful of wildcards that can be given out at its discretion. The wildcard system isn't perfect and sometimes creates controversy, but in general they're used for reasonable purposes: An accomplished player who lost their ranking due to injury and is trying to come back, an up-and-coming star with local ties, a highly-ranked player who didn't enter initially but decided to play at the last minute. The Newport event, which was downgraded from ATP-level to a Challenger tournament this year, gave the wildcard in doubles to Jack Sock on the basis of being a former champion of the tournament and one of the most accomplished doubles players of the last decade. There's just one little issue: Sock, 32, is a pickleball player and podcaster now. His last professional tennis match was at the U.S. Open in 2023, and there is no indication that he's planning a comeback. Also interesting: In an interview with Front Office Sports last week, Ackman said he had never even met Sock but that they were going to begin practicing together last weekend. So Sock – out of the blue, apparently – requested a wildcard from Newport even though his tennis career has long been over. The tournament granted it, and Sock listed Ackman as his doubles partner. Which, again, the tournament allowed even though you can't find results on Ackman in any of the public tennis databases kept by the USTA or Universal Tennis Rating (UTR). Why was Ackman approved to compete? One truly wonders – unless, of course, you know how the world works. But that's not how tennis is supposed to work. Look, it's not the end of the world. While technically the Ackman-Sock wildcard could have gone to a legitimate team that needed the opportunity rather than a sideshow, nobody's career is going to hinge on missing the cut for the doubles draw at the Newport Challenger. But this isn't a golf pro-am. It's the real thing. And as long as we have pro sports, you'd like them to be played by professionals and not exist for the whims of potential benefactors who have a ton of money and a delusion about how good they are at playing tennis. It's a bad look, and it certainly doesn't help the image of a sport that does not necessarily deserve its country club reputation. While some top-ranked players came from privilege, it's not really that different from most other sports. The top two men's players, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz, both emerged from middle class backgrounds. Djokovic grew up flat-out poor in a war-torn country. Coco Gauff started on the public courts in Delray Beach, Florida, inspired by Serena and Venus Williams' rise from Compton, California, to the top of the sport. And even for those who had advantages like Jessica Pegula, whose parents own the Buffalo Bills, there's no faking it in tennis. You have to win the right matches to establish your ranking, which gets you in the right tournaments, which only allows you to maintain that privilege if you keep winning. You can't use your social media fame or friendships or wealth to buy your way onto the pro tour. Unless, apparently, you're Bill Ackman.

mov_EAD941F1427198025B329D7C5A495D80,2025-07-09 14:04:52,en,WEB,"  Released on FX in 2005, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia has now become a cult favorite. Today, it stands tall as America's longest-running sitcom. However, the controversial humor and the roast-style comedy aren't the only reasons for its success. It is rooted deeply in the unique origin stories of the core cast members. Glenn Howerton, Rob McElhenney, Charlie Day, Kaitlin Olson, and Danny DeVito are the pillars that Sunny stands on. This dedicated cast is the face of the series. As the show recently entered its 17th season, let's take a deep dive into each of these actors' journeys before Sunny. Who were they? What did they do before they got famous? How did they stumble upon this life-changing series? Let's find out! Born in Philadelphia in 1997, Rob McElhenney was raised a Christian, with Irish descent parents. He attended Waldron Mercy and Saint Joseph Prep School. He further briefly The Temple University before life took a different turn. He dropped out of college and moved to Los Angeles to pursue his acting dreams. However, in the beginning, he found himself juggling bartending gigs and auditioning for various shows and movies. His first acting role came as a small part in a film called The Devil's Own; however, his role was cut out in the final edit. After another few such misfortunes, he had a small part in the films 13 Conversations About One Thing and A Civil Action. Moving forward, he played substantial parts in the movies The Toll Booth and Latter Days. He even made a guest appearance in the episode “Thrill” on Law and Order. It was when he was 27 years old and waiting tables that he met Glenn Howerton and Charlie Day. This is when they happened upon the idea of the show. It started as a passion project where each of them pulled in some money and shot the pilot for $200. The show was later picked up by FX, and the rest is history. 2 Charlie Day: Charlie Kelly on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia Charlie Day was born in the Bronx in the year 1976. He was raised in Rhode Island and is the son of a music teacher and a music professor. He attended the Penfield School and later graduated from the Portsmouth Abbey School. After this, he studied art history at Merrimack College. Charlie Day as Charlie Kelly in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (Credits: FX) This is when he discovered his performance talent, starting with his stage group with sketches and improvs. In his early days, he secured guest roles in Law and Order, Reno 911, and Third Watch, along with a sitcom called Luis. Early on in his career, he used to create absurd, short films and comedy sketches. This is when he shared a home with Jimmy Simpson. He came in contact with several other actors like Nate Mooney, David Hornsby, and Logan Marshall Green, among others. They all created home videos, which later served as an inspiration when Day joined forces with McElhenney and Glenn Howerton in the year 2003. In addition to starring on the show, he is also one of the key writers and executive producers. His performances have received widespread appreciation and even turned out to be meme material through the years, which is sadly one of the biggest measures of being relevant in today's day and age. 3 Glenn Howerton: Dennis Reynolds on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia Born in April 1976, in Okinawa, Japan, Glenn Howerton is the son of an Air Force Officer. This is why he moved across the country and internationally, including some time in Korea and England, before finally settling in Alabama. He attended Miami Dade College, where he trained in drama. He was also a part of Juilliard's coveted drama division. In the year 2002, Howerton began his career with That 80's show. He was also a guest star on ER in the year 2003. He then had some small roles in films like Serenity, Must Love Dogs, Two Weeks, and The Strangers. Glenn Howerton in a still from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (Credits: FX) He played the role of a doctor in Crank (2006) and its subsequent sequel, Crank: High Voltage (2009). He is also well known for his character Cliff in The Mindy Project. He then went on to become one of the creators of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia...."

An exuberant gaggle of 100-plus people lined up for the competition. A little bit of everybody joined in, all ages, sizes and colors, with partners. The playing field by the fire station and elementary school filled up in an overflowing line. The price: free. Just come as you are after the parade and the antique fire engine rides for kids. The teenage girls with us were ready to rock the egg toss. My brother-in-law and I decided to try our hand. Under the sun, for the first time in many months, I felt lighthearted to be in a certain place and time. The draft root beer tasted good. All of us were in this thing together, no strangers here. I had fled from Washington, D.C., to Madison, Wisconsin. Shorewood Hills by Lake Mendota was the village where my mother grew up. This was my school as a small girl. The green summer scenery looked much the same. Thank goodness for that, after seeing what I had seen in Washington with my Capitol press pass. Covering the halls of Congress, I could not accept what was about to happen. The Trump tax cuts for millionaires and corporations, paid for by draconian cuts to Medicaid and other social safety net services: Surely such a heartless bill could not pass the Senate. Well, the vote was 50-50, so the bill passed when Vice President JD Vance broke the tie. The Senate I once revered as a rookie reporter had vanished in the midnight darkness before the dawn. Giants once walked and talked on that floor. There came a point when I couldn't bear to watch its meek compliance with the president's command to have the massive budget bill done by the Fourth of July. The Senate showed few shreds of independence on Independence Day. So much for being a deliberative body with high-flown debates. So much for being a coequal check on the president. Rather, two Republican women senators huddled with the new Senate majority leader, tall John Thune of tiny South Dakota, to make a sordid deal. Thune hog-butchered carveouts to Sen. Lisa Murkowski's state of Alaska and gave Maine's Sen. Susan Collins a pass to vote ""no."" Collins is up for reelection in 2026. I thought more of Murkowski. Someone tell Lisa that she's there for the good of the nation, not just to represent a single state. Up late to hammer it out, the women of Maine and Alaska were transparent in acting like teenage girls with the star athlete. They had their picture in the paper like chums. A starting player for the first time, Thune sure came through for the MAGA team. There was no time to spare for pieties or pretenses that the new law would benefit any beyond the new robber barons, Trump's special pets on display at his inauguration on Jan. 20. (Just six months ago?) Our own gilded tech barons are making Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller and J.P. Morgan, who gave back libraries and museums for the greater good, look better all the time. Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse put it best, forcefully: ""This place feels to me, today, like a crime scene."" His dark anger felt like a knell to the 1630 first vision of America as a ""city on a hill."" The Rhode Island senator's ancestors were among the early Puritans seeking a ""Mayflower compact"" of self-government, an ocean apart from England's king. (Note, politerati: Trump has bigger things in mind than king. A Roman emperor is more like it.) Back to the egg toss. Good clean fun, a game where everyone meets as equals, from the doctors to the 6-year-olds. A yolk lands on you, but who cares? Democracy is messy. My brother-in-law said, ""We beat them,"" meaning the teenagers. ""Exhilarating yet tranquil,"" a friend of a friend said of Madison.

mov_46721DE17ADDDC33D18D24108792AF83,2025-07-09 15:20:24,en,WEB,"  Obit Edward DiPrete FILE--Former Rhode Island Gov. Edward DiPrete, shown in this Jan. 12, 1998 file photo. AP Photo/Matt York, File)ASSOCIATED PRESS PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) — Former Rhode Island Gov. Edward DiPrete, who served as the state's chief executive for six years and was later jailed , has died. He was 91. Robert Murray, DiPrete's former chief of staff, co nfirmed that the Republican died Tuesday after celebrating his 91st birthday with family. DiPrete, a Republican, served as the state's 70th governor from January 1985 until January 1991. Less than a decade later, he became the first and only former Rhode Island governor to go to prison, having pleaded guilty to bribery, extortion and racketeering charges stemming from his time as the state's chief executive. DiPrete served one year in prison. After his 1999 release, the former governor said he hoped Rhode Islanders would still remember his accomplishments as governor. “I hope historians 25 years from now will say that was a good period in time from a person who did make some mistakes, no question, and did some things he paid dearly for,” he said. Political analyst Darrell West said DiPrete presided over years of relative economic strength in the state, but that his guilty plea and imprisonment were the last memory he left with the public. “He was the first and only governor to go to jail,” West said. “That's an ignoble thing to be on his record.” DiPrete served as governor for three two-year terms, winning reelection in 1986 and 1988, but losing to a Democrat in 1990. A year later, DiPrete was fined $30,000 by the state's Ethics Commission for improperly influencing the award of a state contract, but the former governor's legal odyssey was just beginning. DiPrete and one of his sons, Dennis L. DiPrete, a civil engineer who had never held office, were indicted on March 29, 1994, accused of accepting bribes from architects, engineers, developers and landlords in return for state contracts. The DiPretes were charged with taking at least $294,000 in bribes while the Republican was governor. As they headed for trial in 1997, Superior Court Judge Dominic Cresto dismissed all charges against the pair after finding the attorney general's office had disobeyed his order to turn over evidence to defense lawyers, a move that stunned the top state prosecutor. The state Supreme Court reinstated the charges in January 1998 after the attorney general's office appealed, ruling that Cresto had no authority to dismiss them. On Dec. 11, 1998, less than a month before he and his son were scheduled to stand trial, DiPrete pleaded guilty to 18 counts of bribery, extortion and racketeering, admitting he accepted $250,000 in exchange for state contracts. He was sentenced to serve one year in a work-release program at the state prison. Critics called the sentence too lenient, including then-Gov. Lincoln Almond. DiPrete said he pleaded guilty to end the stress on his family and because he knew it would keep his son out of jail. “Sparing my son and my grandchildren the anguish of these proceedings far outweighed any personal desires to put the state to its proof,” the elder DiPrete said in a statement. A state judge later revoked DiPrete's $50,777 annual pension in November 1999. He appealed, arguing he deserved compensation for past public service, including work for the city of Cranston. The state Supreme Court disagreed, ruling in 2004 that his conduct as governor meant the state Retirement Board did not have to honor his pension. DiPrete often touted his “everyman” persona while in office, taking his large family on vacation in a Winnebago motor home and sometimes serving guests supermarket fried chicken from the RV. In 1987, he decided to park the motor home outside the Rhode Island State House during a snowstorm and slept in it to avoid being stuck in the snow."

mov_8795F1B7DEF1E4F435594B1B387DAA56,2025-07-09 15:42:55,en,WEB,"  BOSTON – Designing helicopter engines wasn't the end of her story. It was just the beginning. Before becoming a trauma surgeon, Dr. Isabel M. Bernal worked as an aerospace engineer, contributing to aircraft such as the Blackhawk. Even while succeeding in a high-tech civilian career, she felt a persistent pull toward medicine. Today, as the newest member of the Navy Medical Corps, Bernal brings both technical precision and surgical expertise to the Fleet with a renewed sense of purpose. “I ultimately felt called to pursue my long-standing dream of becoming a physician. That journey led me here - to the Navy - where I'm proud to bring my background in both engineering and medicine to serve with purpose and integrity,” Bernal said. Bernal believes serving in the Navy is the next evolution of her career. One where she believes her skills can have the greatest impact. “I've always been driven to precision, adaptability and purpose,” Bernal said. “Navy Medicine offers a unique environment where those qualities are not only valued but essential.” Bernal went through multiple avenues before speaking to a recruiter. “I first learned about this opportunity through my search on Doc-cafe [an online job board for physicians]. After applying, I was contacted by an external recruiter who connected me with a representative,” Bernal said. “From there, they coordinated with a Navy recruiter to move the process forward. While the chain of connections may sound complex, everything unfolded quite smoothly from my perspective.” Bernal looks forward to the personal and professional growth in the Navy. “This role aligns with both my personal and professional goals, personally, by allowing me to serve those who serve, and professionally, by challenging me to grow as a clinician and leader in complex, high-pressure settings,” Bernal said. “I'm especially drawn to the camaraderie, sense of duty, and operational readiness that define military medicine.” Bernal believes professionals should consider service as the next level for growth. “This is truly a dream come true. I never imagined I'd have the chance to achieve something like this at this stage in life, and I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity,” Bernal said. “What excites me most about this new role is the chance to serve with purpose, grow as a leader and contribute to something larger than myself.” Bernal's journey from engineering to medicine to military service is a reminder that it's never too late to answer the call. For her, joining the Navy is more than a new role—it's a chance to serve with purpose, grow through challenge and lead with integrity. “You don't need to be fearless,” she said. “Just willing.” NTAG New England supports NRC's mission in Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont, New Hampshire, and eastern New York.

I decided that I didn't really care what it was, but I just wanted to be in that industry in some way,” she says. Wuller worked in New York in animation but moved back to her native L.A. and had another epiphany when she saw visual development art for “Kung Fu Panda” and decided to go into feature animation. She landed a position at DreamWorks Animation, eventually working in visual development for “How to Train Your Dragon.” She continued her work on big DWA features but took a year off with her husband, also a DreamWorks animator, to work in Germany on video games. They came back to the U.S. and launched their own company, the Neuland. About “Smurfs,” she notes that working with the film's production designer Max Boas “was actually one of my bucket list items to do, career-wise, because he's someone that I worked with or worked beside at DreamWorks, but we never worked on the same project.” Wuller sees great opportunity and creativity in the animation world right now, which is what the Neuland thrives on: “The development artwork is super fun, and you can really, really push the envelope, because that's the time that people want to do that.” Fagerquist, who has worked on such projects as “The Mitchells vs. The Machines,” “Vivo,” “Hotel Transylvania 3,” “Spiderman: Into the Spider-verse” and “Smurfs: The Lost Village,” similarly had an epiphany at Massachusetts College of Art when she realized that being an animator was a real job. “I love storyboarding,” she says. “It's been really fun working on 'Smurfs.' I really like figuring out the characters and the story.” Right now, she is working on marking pieces, “mini-movies,” for Sony Picture Animation's sports feature “Goat.” “I'm learning a lot about basketball that I never knew,” she says. — Carole Horst"

Hearings began in Boston Municipal Court on Monday and continued on Tuesday, with at least four unrepresented indigent defendants, or those who cannot afford a private attorney, being released. “The shortage of available attorneys willing and able to take cases on behalf of indigent defendants has placed an unprecedented strain on our system leaving hundreds of individuals without representation, including many who are being held in custody,” Committee for Public Counsel Services spokesman Robert McGovern said Tuesday. A new crop of cases will be heard in Lowell District Court on Wednesday. Eleven of the 18 cases slated to be heard will include those from Chelsea and Somerville district courts, according to the CPCS. Chelsea cases are being heard in Lowell because it is the only district court in Suffolk County not within the BMC system, which is having its own hearings. Under an emergency protocol to deal with the issue, criminal defendants in the district court level could be released if they've been detained for more than seven days without legal representation. Those held more than 45 days could see the charges dismissed. Among the cases set to be heard in Lowell Wednesday involve defendants who face charges including assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, carrying a firearm without a license, drug distribution, resisting arrest, and assault and battery on a family/household member, among others. Work stoppage Bar advocates — court-appointed private attorneys who defend 80% of indigent criminal defendants in Massachusetts — in Suffolk and Middlesex counties stopped working in late May due to a disagreement over hourly rates. The stoppage led to such a backlog that the CPCS filed for relief with the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. Justice Dalila Argaez Wendlandt last week ordered the courts to follow something known as the Lavallee Protocol in response to the issue. The protocol, as Wendlandt describes it, allows for a defendant to be held in lieu of bail or under preventative detention for no more than seven days without a lawyer. Any defendant entitled to appointed counsel must not be forced to wait for more than 45 days for an attorney. Bar advocates receive $65 per hour for district court-level criminal cases, according to data provided by CPCS. These are the attorneys who are on strike. Attorneys working in the superior and appeals courts make $85 per hour and those who handle murder defendants make $120 per hour. These higher-paid attorneys are not part of the strike. As Wendlandt noted in her order, the legislature has not raised rates for bar advocates for years. The pay for bar advocates in Massachusetts, the most populous state in New England, pale in comparison to their regional neighbors: their counterparts in Rhode Island make $112 per hour, in New Hampshire make $125 per hour and in Maine make $150 per hour, according to Defender Services Office Training Division in Washington D.C. CPCS proposed that the rates go up to $73 per hour over two fiscal years. The organization says that each dollar of wage increase could cost $1.2 million in projected expenditures. McGovern, the CPCS spokesman, said that staff attorneys with his organization are salaried criminal defense attorneys who usually represent 20% of criminal defendants. That group, which is also not on strike, is at capacity and will struggle to handle more criminal cases if this continues. “We are fully committed to ensuring that every client we serve receives their constitutional right to counsel, even in these extraordinarily challenging circumstances,” McGovern said. “CPCS is actively working to fulfill our constitutional mandate by triaging cases, prioritizing clients in custody, deploying staff attorneys where capacity allows, and engaging daily with private counsel and bar advocate organizations to identify available resources,” he added. “We are also maintaining open lines of communication with court leadership and policymakers to support long-term solutions.” Cases affected Wendlandt in her order identified 587 unrepresented indigent defendants in the district courts of Middlesex County, at least 25 of whom were detained without representation, six of whom have been held longer than seven days. The justice also identified 557 such defendants with cases in the Boston Municipal courts, with 36 in custody and a total of 21 Suffolk County detainees in custody for more than seven days. BMC Chief Justice Tracy-Lee Lyons on Monday released four indigent defendants, including two Boston men facing drug possession and distribution charges, and another accused of strangling his pregnant girlfriend. One was previously convicted of assault and battery with a dangerous weapon and other drug offenses Lyons held one defendant charged with motor vehicle offenses on a separate warrant. An ongoing issue There is no fix for the work stoppage on the immediate horizon. Shira Diner, a board member and past president of the Massachusetts Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers who is leading the organization's efforts on the issue, told the Herald on Tuesday that the state has “ignored the issue of insufficient number of bar advocates for years.” “The criminal legal system is based on constitutional principles of due process. Everyone in the system has a role to play. When one group, in this case defense lawyers, are unable to play their part, the entire system is unable to function,” Diner continued. “The legislature needs to act quickly to raise the rates for the bar advocates so they will be able to go back to the critical work of representing 80% of the indigent defendants in Massachusetts,” Diner continued. A spokesperson for Gov. Maura Healey said the governor “is concerned about the negative public safety impacts of this work stoppage” and “urges all those impacted to work together to reach a resolution and ensure that all defendants receive the representation to which they are entitled.” “Bar advocates do incredibly important work to make sure that everyone has their due process rights protected, and they deserve to be paid a fair wage,” Healey Press Secretary Karissa Hand told the Herald Tuesday. ©2025 MediaNews Group, Inc.

mov_D15FC9D9BB4B40457DA7C996790218F5,2025-07-09 16:30:00,en,WEB,"  Walk into any Rhode Island classroom, and you will meet a growing number of students who speak a language other than English at home. The state sees this as an opportunity, not a deficit. Over the past five years, Rhode Island has deepened its commitment to ensuring all students, including multilingual learners, have access to rigorous, high-quality instructional materials and that teachers have the necessary training to implement them. While overall gaps still exist in the state, students who recently exited multilingual-learner status are now outperforming peers who are native English speakers on statewide exams. Get stories like this delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up for The 74 Newsletter Multilingual learners — who now comprise more than 15% of the state's K-12 student population — represent one of Rhode Island's fastest-growing and most vibrant communities. In fact, Rhode Island saw the largest percentage growth of any state in the nation between 2010 and 2020. Over the last 10 years, enrollment of multilingual students in many school districts has risen between 100% and 400%. In Providence, the state's largest city, multilingual learners currently make up almost 40% of all students. To ensure that these young people received high-quality, inclusive instruction — with materials that reflected their diverse cultural and linguistic experiences, supported English language development and connected with what all students in the state's classrooms were learning — the Rhode Island Department of Education partnered with the nonprofit English Learners Success Forum in 2021. The goal was to create a cohort to help district leadership teams follow through on the state's Blueprint for Multilingual Learner Success by better addressing the needs of these students in core instruction, school design and programming. Districts now choose from several high-quality curricula, which cannot get that designation unless they are designed from the start with multilingual learners in mind. The department encourages district leaders to identify their instructional vision and consider the demographics and needs of their students before reviewing and selecting curricula. Districts must also plan initial and ongoing professional development to ensure teachers are prepared to properly implement the new materials. High-quality curriculum by itself can drive student growth, but its impact can be greater with proper professional learning and skillful implementation. That's why the department's partnership with the forum didn't stop at curricular materials; it also prioritized the people who will actually be using them. When educators complete their professional development sessions, they come away with a clear understanding of what rigorous instruction looks like. Principals and other school leaders are challenged to ask: How do we know this curriculum works for our multilingual learners?” Teachers learn to go beyond providing basic help and use methods that make challenging material understandable for every student. This includes providing regular opportunities for students to discuss topics and clear goals for language learning. When teachers know how to provide the right support and understand how students develop language skills in different subjects, young people rise to the challenge and often exceed expectations. Rhode Island's commitment to strong instruction with high-quality materials, following the department's blueprint and strategic plan for multilingual student success, form the foundation of this work. Together, they create consistent instructional expectations and invest in ongoing professional development to support the academic success of all students. The state is also implementing new regulations for multilingual learners to better align with federal requirements, best practices,and the state's commitment to providing a high-quality education. More in U.S. The results are very encouraging. Nationwide, Rhode Island ranked 14th in math recovery and 13th in reading between 2019 and 2024, according to Harvard's Education Recovery Scorecard. This year's scorecard also noted that Rhode Island leads all New England states in academic recovery. This improvement is not just happening in urban hubs; there is a growing commitment to these students in rural and suburban communities that have historically had little exposure to non-English-speaking populations. Related Honoring Bilingual Students' Linguistic Diversity & Cultural Heritage Year Round For other states to see similar progress, they must follow two simple but critical steps: adopt rigorous instructional materials that meet the needs of all students, and provide consistent, high-quality professional development for teachers, principals and other school leaders. There is no perfect curriculum. But with the right approach, even great materials can be made better. The key is starting with a strong foundation, giving educators the tools to teach their new curriculum effectively and then continuing to offer professional development long after they've started using the new materials. Surveys show that many teachers simply haven't received the training they need to implement new materials effectively. That has to change. Professional learning must be continuous and available during the regular workday, encouraging teachers to keep improving their classroom skills. Rhode Island's progress is a testament to what's possible when state leadership, district teams and national partners work together with one shared goal: creating a system where multilingualism is seen as a strength, not a barrier, and where every classroom reflects the rich diversity of all students."

In a rare move, businesses and environmentalists have joined forces in court to furiously fight New York's Empire Wind One offshore project, saying that it will devastate both the commercial fishing industry and marine life in local waters. “A decade ago, we said it would affect fishermen, fisheries, and guess what? The state didn't care,” said Bonnie Brady, executive director of the Long Island Commercial Fishing Association. “We are collateral damage — even though we feed people.” The decade-long planned energy initiative, which began construction last April off the coasts of New York and New Jersey, faces a growing lawsuit from stakeholders in the tri-state area. The Bronx's massive Fulton Fish Market Cooperative, which employs around 1,200, and Nassau County's Point Lookout Fishing Club, and the Long Island Commercial Fishing Association are some of the groups joining a legal action brought by environmentalists in the area. Explore More Fulton's CEO said that the project will “kill longstanding American port communities and economies” and grab “thousands of real jobs, a sustainable food source, and the heart of the NY restaurant and tourism industry” by the gills as well. Ocean City, Maryland has also come out in opposition of another offshore wind project close to its coast as well. Locally on LI, Brady explained that in Point Lookout and nearby Long Beach — a mere 14 miles from the Empire project in the New York Bight — boats must dramatically divert around the massive windmill poles to reach canyons for fishing. “Think of cruising on the Long Island Expressway and suddenly there's a bunch of telephone poles in the road.” “They can't go through these projects because, God forbid, they lose power. Then what? Then they're just floating in the sea, so they can hit one of them,” she said, adding that fishing organizations in New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and Massachusetts are also in the lawsuit for similar reasons. Beyond afflicting the industry, the intense, concussive noise and vibrations of the Empire Wind's construction are deafening whales, advocates warn. Environmental groups Protect Our Coast NJ and Clean Ocean Action are also driving the same legal action over the threat to local whales — including the endangered North Atlantic right whale. “Some of them are going to be permanently deafened as a result of this project,” said Brady, who noted that three dead humpback whales were recently spotted off local shores. “If you're deaf and the sea is dark, and then you have to come up to the surface because you can't hear or see what's going on. Then you can be hit by a ship.” Wailing on business Billionaire John Catsimatidis has also been a staunch opponent of the project as well. “Not only is it killing the fishing business on Long Island, they're going to kill our whales, and they're going to increase the price of electricity for homes,” he said. “I talked to the President about it a few weeks ago…he hates windmills, but he wasn't able to stop it because it was already put through before his term.” Catsimatidis recently interviewed Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, who also is churning against the 180 foot tall windmills — ones which will cost New Yorkers about 2.5 times the market rate for electricity, per a recent analysis. “If you're not sure which way to go… you look at the map and you look at the economics, well, that should convince you against wind,” the Long Island based politician told Catsimatidis Sunday on WABC 770. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has also expressed fears over increased sightings of dead whales around offshore wind sites. “We've had 109 whale groundings in the last 22 months. And they're all in the proximity of these new offshore wind farms,” Kennedy told Catsimatidis last month. “In the 20 years before that, the average whale grounding was 2.6 per year.” Kevin Halpin of the Point Lookout Fishing Club fears that the damage to marine life and the local ecosystem “could be irreversible.” “All for a project which is dirty, dangerous to our safety, and completely inefficient,” he added. Equinor, the company in charge of Empire Wind, did not immediately return a request for comment.

The state Senate advanced a bill Tuesday night that would require public schools to restrict phone use. The Joint Education Committee redrafted legislation combining seven different Senate bills, including legislation supported by Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell. ""A bell-to-bell phone-free school policy keeps students focused throughout the full school day,"" Campbell said. ""This includes instructional time, as well as passing periods, lunch, and other non-instructional time."" Rhode Island is about to ban cellphones in schools. Here's when it could take effect The Senate's version of the bill would allow school districts to make their own plans, but they must be approved by the state Department of Education. Campbell said it's a commitment to both young people's education and their mental health. Brockton High School has already enacted a similar policy by locking students' phones in pouches during the day. The principal said the impact has been noticeable. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, around 77% of public schools nationwide already limit cellphone use during class. In Rhode Island, all school districts are required to have a policy prohibiting the use of cellphones, smart watches and other personal devices during the school day starting next August.

The Kansas City Chiefs player gave a subtle nod to girlfriend Taylor Swift on the latest episode of his “New Heights” podcast, wearing a shirt that he seemingly picked up on the couple's recent vacation. Eagle-eyed fans noticed that the logo on his white tee matched that of Yellowstone Club, a private residential club and ski resort in in Big Sky, Montana, where Swift and Kelce stayed earlier this year.

The singer and pro athlete — who were snapped grabbing a low-key lunch at JoJo's Bar in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, ahead of the holiday — are said to be relishing their downtime together as Kelce ramps up for the upcoming NFL season. “It's been a turning point for their relationship in a lot of ways,” an insider told People earlier this month.

mov_B6DE2AEBFE45B503517526CA0B88E1ED,2025-07-09 20:29:53,en,WEB,"  Tens of thousands of workers across the federal government are hoping their unions and allies in local governments and nonprofit groups have a Plan B — a day after the Supreme Court said the Trump administration could proceed with firing them. The hope hangs on the ruling's suggestion that lower courts could still consider direct challenges to agencies' reorganization plans. But that will require plaintiffs to bring more detailed cases quickly and convince judges to stop the layoffs before they become a fait accompli. As cases become more granular, plaintiffs will likely face an uphill battle. And the White House said it plans to restart the terminations immediately. Federal workers, who have long seen civil service laws and collective bargaining agreements as shields protecting their jobs, told POLITICO their world has been shaken. “All of my friends are resigned to the worst,"" said a National Institutes of Health staffer who was granted anonymity due to fear of retribution. Some workers in the Environmental Protection Agency's Washington headquarters waited on news from the basement, where they decamped in search of cooler temperatures after a stretch of blistering heat and minimal afternoon air conditioning stemming from an administration directive to conserve energy. A staffer in a different office said EPA employees were “waiting on pins and needles.” The plaintiffs, led by the largest of the federal employee unions, the American Federation of Government Employees, but joined by cities and counties in California, Illinois, Maryland, Texas, and Washington, as well as advocacy groups, promised to fight on in a statement, but provided no clarity on their plan. One of the court's liberal justices, Sonia Sotomayor, suggested they might receive a different response if they provide examples of unlawful actions by individual agencies. ""The plans themselves are not before this Court, at this stage, and we thus have no occasion to consider whether they can and will be carried out consistent with the constraints of law,"" she wrote. No previous president, since Congress professionalized the civil service to protect it from political interference, has attempted such a wholesale reorganization and the plaintiffs argued President Donald Trump needed congressional approval to do so. But the Supreme Court, ruling 8-1, said the plaintiffs were likely to fail in their broad challenge to Trump's plan. The decision, if it's the last word, would mark a major reversal in the pre-Trump conventional wisdom that federal workers enjoyed significant job protections. And it would allow Trump and presidents going forward to use the threat of layoffs to pressure federal workers to carry out political appointees' orders, or to root out dissenters. The ripple effects could disrupt agencies' ability to carry out their mandates, said Paul Light, a former Senate Government Affairs Committee staffer and professor emeritus of public service at New York University. “You are giving a large number of potential federal officers a very clear statement that they might as well go elsewhere,” Light said. “The more people who exit, the less ability that you have to respond to significant threats.” But the White House said the bureaucracy is overdue for a downsizing and that it plans to quickly resume wide-ranging layoffs and restructuring. “We see the ruling as the Supreme Court reaffirming that the president has complete authority to direct the executive branch, and with that, we will be reducing and simplifying the size of the federal government,” a senior administration official said Wednesday.Early this year, the administration directed agencies across the government to draft plans for reorganizations, including “large-scale” cuts to their workforces. That drastic overhaul was due to be finalized by Sept. 30, although it's unclear whether the litigation will impact the timing. More in Politics Agencies had plans “basically ready to go” prior to the court's Tuesday ruling, a White House official granted anonymity to speak more freely about the legal strategy said. The next moves will proceed “agency by agency,” but “the goal of reducing the size of the federal government will be front and center.” Individual agencies will be “awaiting guidance, but they are going to be pursuing [reductions in force] consistent with all applicable legal requirements for their individual agencies,” the official said. “We're going to be operating immediately. This is a priority for the administration. You don't want an unnecessary bureaucracy.” On Wednesday, federal workers remained in wait-and-see mode, uncertain and awaiting word from agency lawyers on how to interpret what the ruling would mean for them. Staffers at the Health and Human Services and Transportation departments and the Environmental Protection Agency described feeling anxious and exhausted by the back and forth over their jobs. ""F–k it,"" another NIH staffer said. ""I'm ready to retire if I can."" A California judge had blocked the mass layoffs at 21 agencies in May on the grounds that they would likely violate federal law. The unsigned ruling from the Supreme Court, which the majority explained in two terse paragraphs, lifts the injunction issued by federal district Judge Susan Illston. Trump's Department of Government Efficiency, then led by billionaire Elon Musk, directed the layoffs shortly after Trump came to office in January. Those cuts resulted in the firing of more than 20,000 probationary employees across the executive branch, primarily workers who had been in their jobs for two years or less or who had recently switched roles. A number of more limited challenges to the layoffs remain viable, said Max Stier, an attorney who serves as founding president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit group that aims to improve the way the government functions. “[The order] shouldn't, in and of itself, resolve those other cases,” he said. The administration, for example, faces other legal challenges over its restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services, which saw a quarter of its workforce bought out or let go, although hundreds of those workers have since been brought back. A Rhode Island federal judge earlier this month issued a preliminary injunction blocking the termination of employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration's Center for Tobacco Products and the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation, as well as employees who work on the Head Start program. “HHS previously announced our plans to transform this Department to Make America Healthy Again and we intend to do just that,” HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon wrote in a text Wednesday. POLITICO reporters who cover the agencies found disquiet across the bureaucracy: Department of Transportation: The Supreme Court decision paves the way for DOT to terminate the 700 workers it had sought to let go in February — but problems with air traffic control this year, including a midair collision between an Army helicopter and a passenger jet that killed 67 people near Washington, could affect the calculus. Though the Trump administration insisted that no air traffic controllers were slated for termination, POLITICO has reported that staffers who support them were — raising alarm from lawmakers and placing any layoffs at the agency under a microscope. During a March Cabinet meeting, Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy clashed with Musk over the reductions, according to The New York Times. The Times reported that Duffy said Musk's cost-cutters had wanted him to let air traffic controllers go, and that ..."

Hassenfeld, a renowned philanthropist and former CEO of iconic toy company Hasbro Inc., the maker of G.I. Joe and Play-Doh, has died. He was 76, according to the toy company. Hasbro, the nation's second largest toy company behind Mattel, declined to offer more details. Hassenfeld's family foundation, Hassenfeld Family Initiatives, wasn't immediately available to comment. Hassenfeld was born in Providence, Rhode Island and graduated from Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts. He received an undergraduate arts degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1970. Upon graduation, he joined the Pawtucket, Rhode Island-based family business in 1970. Hasbro was founded in 1923, by Hassenfeld's grandfather, Henry. Known initially as Hassenfeld Brothers, it sold textile remnants but expanded into school supplies and later toy manufacturing under the Hasbro name in the 1940s, according to Hasbro's website. It went public in 1968. Hassenfeld rose quickly in the family business serving as special assistant to the president and worked his way up the rank s. He became one of the key architects of Hasbro's international operations and spent extensive time traveling overseas. He was named executive vice president in 1980 and became president in September 1984. Hassenfeld labored for years in the shadow of his older brother Stephen. His brother's death of pneumonia in June 1989 at age 47, however, moved Hassenfeld into the position of chairman and chief executive officer. Hassenfeld stepped down as CEO in 2003 and in August 2005, he retired from his chairman position and became emeritus chairman. He stepped away from that role last year. Hassenfeld was the last family member to sit on the board, according to Hasbro. “All of us who have ever had any connection to Hasbro today are mourning the profound loss of Alan Hassenfeld, our beloved former Chairman & CEO, mentor, and dear friend, ” Hasbro CEO Chris Cocks in an e-mailed statement to The Associated Press. “Alan's enormous heart was, and will remain, the guiding force behind Hasbro — compassionate, imaginative, and dedicated to bringing a smile to the face of every child around the world. His tireless advocacy for philanthropy, children's welfare, and the toy industry created a legacy that will inspire us always.” Hassenfeld was involved in many charitable and social causes both nationally and locally in Rhode Island. His concerns ranged from childhood hunger to issues involving refugee settlement in the state. As chairman of the Hassenfeld Family Initiatives, he oversaw the foundation's mission of globalizing safety and human rights within the area of children's products; empowering women in developing countries; and enhancing the economy, education and business opportunities in Rhode Island."
mov_E5ED8E1B8B114963B8036F27619268C7,2025-07-09 20:55:20,en,WEB,"  President Donald Trump expressed his disdain for wind power during a meeting with his Cabinet recently, calling it an expensive form of energy that “smart” countries don't use. His comments on Tuesday contained false and misleading information about the use of wind power in the United States and around the world, and came on the heels of an executive order he signed Monday that would end subsidies around “green” energy. Here's a look at the facts. CLAIM: “Wind is a very expensive form of energy.” THE FACTS: Onshore wind is one of the cheapest sources of electricity generation, with new wind farms expected to produce electricity around $30 per megawatt hour. This compares to a new natural gas plant, around $65 per megawatt hour, or a new advanced nuclear reactor, which runs over $80, according to estimates from the Energy Information Administration. Onshore wind farms cost less to build and operate than natural gas plants on average in most regions of the United States, even without tax credits. Though natural gas plants are available to produce electricity at any time of the day, unlike wind. Offshore wind is among the sources of new power generation that will cost the most to build and operate, at $88 per megawatt hour, according to the EIA. While electricity rates have risen nationwide over the past decade, states that have added a significant amount of onshore wind power, such as Iowa, Kansas, Oklahoma and New Mexico, have kept rates from rising as fast as other states, said Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at the nonpartisan think tank Energy Innovation. For example, the share of electricity generated from wind in Iowa increased from 15% in 2010 to nearly 60% of the state's electricity generation in 2023, while the state's electricity rates grew at a rate slower than that of 42 other states, his research found. Wind power can be expensive if it's built where winds are weaker, but the United States is adding it in places with strong wind resources, he added. “Wind should be seen as part of an overall portfolio of electricity system resources and is an important part of keeping costs down,” he said Wednesday. Donald Trump has committed to increasing U.S. energy production, particularly fossil fuels. He signed an executive order Monday aimed at phasing out tax credits for wind and solar facilities. CLAIM: Wind turbines are “almost exclusively” made in China, but President Xi Jinping told Trump they have “very, very few.” THE FACTS: China is the world's largest manufacturer of wind turbines, producing more than half of the supply. It is also installing them in China at a record pace. In total, China has 1.3 terawatts of utility-scale wind and solar capacity in development, which could generate more electricity than neighboring Japan consumed in all of 2023, according to a report from the Global Energy Monitor released Wednesday. The report highlighted China's offshore wind development, calling China the undisputed leader in the offshore wind sector, though it also said coal and gas are still on the rise across China. “The whole narrative that we're led to believe in the West is that China is building coal plants and that it's doing nothing for its carbon footprint,” Tom Harper, partner at the global consultant Baringa, said Tuesday. “So the surprising thing is China is building a portfolio of zero-carbon resources that are designed to not perfectly complement each other, but to work alongside each other to reduce reliance on fossil fuels.” More in World CLAIM: “If you look at smart countries, they don't use it.” THE FACTS: At least 136 countries around the world use wind power to generate electricity, according to the EIA, with many countries growing the amount they produce. The top five markets for wind power in 2024 were China, the U.S., Brazil, India and Germany, while Uzbekistan, Egypt and Saudi Arabia represent the next wave of wind energy growth, according to the Global Wind Energy Council. Council CEO Ben Backwell said 2024 marked yet another record year for wind energy growth, with the “industry increasingly pushing into new regions.” Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, disputed the idea that smart countries don't use wind power. China is soaring ahead in building a massive amount of wind power while Germany, the United Kingdom, Finland, Spain, Sweden, France and many other countries in Europe have large programs of wind construction, he said Wednesday. “By cutting back on wind power development, the U.S. is ceding the lead to China in this important technology, and killing a lot of U.S. jobs,” Gerrard said in an e-mail. CLAIM: In New England, two whales washed up over 50 years, “and last summer they had 14 washed up. Now, I'm not saying that's the wind farm that was built, that maybe it is right.” THE FACTS: There are no known links between large whale deaths and ongoing offshore wind activities, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA says it analyzes the causes of death whenever possible, following the science and data. Unfounded claims about offshore wind threatening whales have surfaced as a flashpoint in the fight over the future of renewable energy. The nation's first commercial-scale offshore wind farm officially opened in 2024 east of Montauk Point, New York. The nation's second-largest offshore wind farm is under construction off the coast of Massachusetts. A five-turbine pilot project has been operating since 2016 off the coast of Rhode Island. CLAIM: “The birds are dying all over the place.” THE FACTS: Turbines, like all infrastructure, can pose a risk to birds. However, the National Audubon Society, which is dedicated to the conservation of birds, thinks developers can manage these risks and climate change is a greater threat. An Audubon report found that two-thirds of North American bird species could face extinction due to rising temperatures. In January, the nonprofit said responsible offshore wind development is a clear win for birds, the U.S. economy and the climate. “While persistent myths claim widespread and devastating effects of offshore wind turbines on wildlife, the science tells a different story. Our findings clearly indicate that we can responsibly deploy offshore wind in a manner that still protects birds and their habitats,” Sam Wojcicki, Audubon's senior director for climate policy, wrote in a January post. The organization also supports wind energy on land when it is sited and operated properly to minimize the impact on birds and other wildlife. CLAIM: “You can't take them down because the environmentalists don't let you bury the blades.” THE FACTS: Wind turbine blades are challenging to recycle. They are designed for durability to withstand hurricane-force winds. However, the U.S. already has the ability to recycle most wind turbine materials, according to the Department of Energy...."

In an interview, Democratic Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island blamed the sweeping rollback of environmental protections on a flood of unlimited, anonymous corporate political spending, and said exposing the scale of this ""fraud"" is key to breaking its grip. His remarks came as the death toll from catastrophic flooding in Texas linked by scientists to climate change threatened to surge further. ""This isn't even government any longer,"" the 69-year-old told a small group of reporters ahead of an address to Congress Wednesday -- his 300th so-called ""Time to Wake Up"" speech, delivered as activists reel from Trump's actions. ""This is an occupying force from the fossil fuel industry that has injected itself into the key positions of responsibility,"" said the lawmaker. ""It has the appearance of being government -- they ride around in the black cars... they have the offices, they have the titles,"" he said. But in reality, ""they're fossil fuel flunkies... and they care not a whit for public opinion or public safety."" Big Oil spent at least $445 million to help elect Trump, according to a recent analysis by Climate Power, which said its figure was likely a vast underestimate because of undisclosed donations. In his second term, Republican Trump has pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord, gutted science agencies, fired researchers and forecasters, scrapped his predecessor Joe Biden's clean energy tax cuts and rolled back powerplant and vehicle efficiency standards. Whitehouse calls it the oil, coal and gas industry's ""most sordid dreams come true"" and says the stage was set by the 2010 Supreme Court ""Citizens United"" ruling, which unleashed an era of unchecked corporate political spending. A former state attorney general who battled corporate polluters, he recalled that when he first joined the Senate, climate bipartisanship flourished: John McCain, the GOP's 2008 presidential nominee, had ""a perfectly respectable climate platform,"" while Republican senators proposed bills. ""These weren't little tiddlywinks, nibble-at-the-edges bills,"" he recalled, but would have genuinely changed the trajectory of climate emissions. Citizens United reversed century-old campaign finance restrictions and opened the floodgates to dark money. ""They were able to come into the Republican Party and say, 'We will give you unlimited amounts of money. You will have more money in your elections than you've ever seen before.'"" Despite the bleak landscape, Whitehouse still sees a narrow path to climate safety -- and points to several potential game changers. First, he cites the possible emergence of a global carbon pricing effort, spearheaded by the European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, which taxes importers based on their climate footprint. Countries like the UK, Canada, Mexico and Australia could join this movement, creating a de facto global price on carbon, enforced through trade -- without US legislation. Second, he says, Democrats can and must expose fossil fuel's stranglehold on the Republican party, a phenomenon he calls one of the ""most grave incidents of political corruption and fraud that the country has ever seen,"" and pass a bill forcing donor transparency. Third, what was once framed as a crisis for polar bears -- and later as an opportunity for green jobs -- is today directly hitting Americans where it hurts most: their wallets. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has warned that climate change will shrink mortgage availability across swaths of the United States in the coming years as banks and insurers retreat from fire- and flood-prone regions. Risks could cascade from an insurance crunch into a broader mortgage collapse -- potentially triggering a 2008-style crash. Whitehouse predicts the fossil fuel industry's hold on Republicans won't last forever. ""When it becomes clear what has been done here, then there's going to be a dramatic reset,"" he said. ""A reckoning will come for this. There's no doubt about it -- it's just the nature of human affairs."" Trump himself, he added, was merely swept along by the dominant current of the post-2010 Republican Party, with no ideological stake in the issue. As recently as 2009, he co-signed a full-page advertisement in the New York Times demanding stronger climate action from then president Barack Obama.

A Rhode Island man faces serious charges after he allegedly threatened to kill President Donald Trump and multiple members of his administration on Truth Social. The Department of Justice (DOJ) said 37-year-old Carl D. Montague has been charged with threats against the president, interstate threats, threats to assault and kidnap, or murder of a U.S. official, judge or law enforcement officer. Montague is accused of writing a profanity-laced post on Truth Social on June 27, 2025, threatening to shoot and kill Trump, Attorney General Pam Bondi and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller. The FBI wrote in a criminal complaint filed against Montague that it was notified by Trump Media and Technology, the parent company of Truth Social, about the post at 11:30 p.m. on June 27. FEDERAL GRAND JURY INDICTS MAN FOR THREATENING TO ASSASSINATE TRUMP AFTER REELECTION A Rhode Island man is accused of threatening to kill President Donald Trump and members of his administration in a post on Truth Social last month. (Rick Scuteri) The post read, “It's a shame you won't get to see the end of our f- – – – -g term, because I'm gonna make sure I put a bullet…between your f- – – – -g head you piece of s- -t, you Pam Bondi.

FORMER COAST GUARD OFFICER ARRESTED AFTER ALLEGEDLY THREATENING TO ASSASSINATE TRUMP: FBI The criminal complaint alleges that Montague said he was smoking a lot of marijuana when he posted the threat. It is also alleged he claimed to delete the Truth Social account after sending the message.

This year's lineup, which tees off Friday, July 11, includes Stephen Curry, Aaron Rodgers, Charles Barkley and Kelce's brother, Jason. Swift's attendance hasn't been confirmed, but the pop superstar's consistent presence alongside Kelce this summer makes it increasingly likely.

Swift and Kelce also spent the Fourth of July weekend at the exclusive Yellowstone Club in Montana, reportedly skipping Swift's traditional Rhode Island bash for more private time together.

Email tips@dailymail.com Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce whisked themselves away for a romantic trip to celebrate the Fourth of July at the members-only Yellowstone Club in Montana. The Grammy winner, 35 - who has recently been spotted enjoying lowkey dates with the NFL player - spent quality time with her boyfriend over the weekend at the private resort located in the town of Big Sky, per DeuxMoi. The Bad Blood songstress is known for throwing her own Fourth of July bashes at her Rhode Island mansion, but it has been the second year in a row where the beauty has opted to not do so. Last year, the performer was notably in the midst of her sold-out Eras Tour during the holiday. The gossip site reported the update in its newsletter - and the A-list couple are no strangers to the exclusive location. Back in March, both Swift and Kelce whisked themselves away to the Yellowstone Club where they were seen dining with sports journalist Erin Andrews. At the time, a source told People, 'Erin is close friends with Taylor and Travis, and Travis even jokingly credits Erin with encouraging Taylor to date him.' The trio - who are 'good friends' - had grabbed a bite to eat at the Auric Room at Lone Mountain Ranch. The Yellowstone Club is described as 'an exclusive private, members-only ski, golf, and adventure community,' according to the official website. 'In this Rocky Mountain wonderland, you'll find world-class skiing, golf, fine dining, and plenty of fun for the whole family.' Some of the amenities offered to members include access to the golf course, golf clubhouse, ski slopes, Rainbow Lodge, as well as fitness and yoga classes. Taylor and Travis - who first confirmed their romance in September 2023 - have been seen on recent dates over the past few months. Shortly before Fourth of July, the lovebirds traveled to the NFL player's home state of Ohio to grab lunch at JoJo's Bar located in Chagrin Falls. The pair could be seen sitting closely at a table near a window, with the songstress showing off her personal style in a white blouse and pleated skirt. Her blonde locks were styled into a chic ponytail while her bangs gently fell onto her forehead. Kelce kept it casual for the outing in a teal-striped shirt as they held a lighthearted conversation inside the eatery with another male companion. The restaurant's manager, John Ponyicky, told People: 'Taylor and Travis came in and had a wonderful time.' John added, 'They had a great lunch, enjoyed our food, and were really impressed with the team. Travis grew up in Cleveland Heights, so he decided to visit somewhere he was familiar with. 'He and Taylor were both really pleasant. They sat at the bar for a bit, but also had a private lunch in a private room.' Kelce was visiting his home state of Ohio to attend the Alex's Way charity golf tournament, per a fan account. During a recent appearance on the Bussin' With the Boys podcast, the Kansas City Chiefs tight end slammed rumors that his outings with Swift were to 'seek attention.' The sports star said, 'We're having fun with it, being a couple...We're just enjoying life and having fun.' He then opened up about the media attention and scrutiny when it comes to their high-profile relationship. 'That's probably the only thing I didn't really grasp until you're in it. That's probably the craziest thing.' Travis added, 'Like, I'm just playing golf and all of the sudden in the trees there's just a f***ing guy with a camera. Like, ah s***. I gotta go to the restroom now. I can't just go over here and take a pi**.' And shortly before the romantic trip, both Kelce and Swift were also spotted heading out for date night in NYC. They also stopped by Tight End University's 'Tight Ends & Friends' benefit at Brooklyn Bowl in Nashville - where Swift took to the stage for a surprise performance of her hit song Shake It Off. Last month in June, Taylor achieved the big milestone of regaining control of her masters - which Travis also made 'even more special.' A source told People, 'Reclaiming her masters has been emotional and empowering. She's proud, relieved, and finally feels like a chapter has closed in the best possible way. Having Travis by her side for that milestone made it even more special. The NFL star was also 'honored to support her and he wouldn't have wanted it any other way.' Their nearly two-year romance has also recently hit a 'turning point.' 'They're incredibly happy and in sync. There's a calmness and ease to their relationship right now that's been really grounding for Taylor and Travis.' The insider added, 'Taylor and Travis are soaking up every minute of this slower season together. They've been splitting their time between New York, Nashville, and a few quiet getaways, just enjoying each other's company without all the usual chaos. 'This kind of downtime is rare for both of them, and it's really allowed their bond to deepen.' Travis is preparing for his 13th season with the NFL and has been attending training sessions in the state of Florida. Games are set to kick off later this year on September 5 - with the Chiefs taking on the Los Angeles Chargers for their first game. Swift has often been spotted supporting her boyfriend from the stands, and has attended over 20 games. She was also seen cheering on Kelce during the 2024 Super Bowl which saw the Philadelphia Eagles defeat the Chiefs 40-22 in February."

You'll need to inbox me a delivery address. MAGA country and Evangelical Christians have been helping pedophiles evade justice for years. Take for example Jimmy Julius Karow he's is a wanted man and is considered dangerous. Accused of sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl in Oregon in 2000, he fled to Israel before authorities in the U.S. could apprehend him or figure out where he went. Karow has been running from U.S. law enforcement ever since. Currently INTERPOL, an inter-governmental policing organization that works with 194 countries, has a Red Notice to alert police worldwide that he's a fugitive. Why is Memorial Day a national holiday? It's a day of remembrance to honor all those who died in service to the U.S. Yet, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem traveled to Israel over Memorial Day posted a video of herself praying at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem America 1st, right? Was Trump close to Epstein? Yes! Does that mean Trump was sex-trafficking minors? No! So who is Trump protecting? Israel! Epstein was working for Israeli intelligence. Why is Benjamin Netanyahu is the most powerful man in the world. It's not POTUS and it's not the pope. Ask yourself, how does a corrupt prime minister of a tiny little country of 8 million people in the desert with historically low approval rating in his own country (below 30%) become so powerful? Nobody says no to him. We go to war whenever he says we should, he controls our congress/law makers. Out of the 8 million people living in Israel, USA is paying housing for 1 million. Let that sink in. All 8 million people are on Medicaid, at least those who want it, Paid for by USA. I am not blaming Trump because it was the same under Biden and Obama. I wrote this commentary below in April, most MAGA yelled “TDS” in the comments. When I wasn't criticizing Trump as much as I trying to open eyes about the dangers of the Israeli lobby. April-2025 Free Speech/the 1st amendment is officially dead in America. The killer is a foreign lobby called AiPAC with the help of corrupt politicians like Elise Stefanik, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, Fox News Media talking heads like Sean Hannity, influencers such as Ben Shapiro, and billionaires such as Bill Ackman. The saddest Part is, MAGA country zealots are too focused on demonizing blacks and immigrants to notice it. While MAGA country is busy trying to “own the libs”, a foreign country is owning them. I have accepted the fact that my life will be ruined by posting this comment. Last week Attorney General Pam Bondi  & Trump administration announced a Task Force to Combat Antisemitism. The task force is investigating allegations of antisemitism on university campuses. They will focus on the top 10 most prestigious universities. 2 months ago Trump signed an Executive Order to Combat Anti-Semitism. Last year  Joe Biden signed measures to fight antisemitism on college campuses. So why so many so many executives orders to protect the Jewish community? The Answer is AIPAC! AIPAC is the mostly powerful and the most corrupt lobby in America. It has corrupted half of elected politicians in DC and talking heads at Fox news.

You'll need to inbox me a delivery address. MAGA country and Evangelical Christians have been helping pedophiles evade justice for years. Take for example Jimmy Julius Karow he's is a wanted man and is considered dangerous. Accused of sexually assaulting a 9-year-old girl in Oregon in 2000, he fled to Israel before authorities in the U.S. could apprehend him or figure out where he went. Karow has been running from U.S. law enforcement ever since. Currently INTERPOL, an inter-governmental policing organization that works with 194 countries, has a Red Notice to alert police worldwide that he's a fugitive. Why is Memorial Day a national holiday? It's a day of remembrance to honor all those who died in service to the U.S. Yet, U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem traveled to Israel over Memorial Day posted a video of herself praying at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem America 1st, right? Was Trump close to Epstein? Yes! Does that mean Trump was sex-trafficking minors? No! So who is Trump protecting? Israel! Epstein was working for Israeli intelligence. Why is Benjamin Netanyahu is the most powerful man in the world. It's not POTUS and it's not the pope. Ask yourself, how does a corrupt prime minister of a tiny little country of 8 million people in the desert with historically low approval rating in his own country (below 30%) become so powerful? Nobody says no to him. We go to war whenever he says we should, he controls our congress/law makers. Out of the 8 million people living in Israel, USA is paying housing for 1 million. Let that sink in. All 8 million people are on Medicaid, at least those who want it, Paid for by USA. I am not blaming Trump because it was the same under Biden and Obama. I wrote this commentary below in April, most MAGA yelled “TDS” in the comments. When I wasn't criticizing Trump as much as I trying to open eyes about the dangers of the Israeli lobby. April-2025 Free Speech/the 1st amendment is officially dead in America. The killer is a foreign lobby called AiPAC with the help of corrupt politicians like Elise Stefanik, Ted Cruz, Lindsey Graham, Fox News Media talking heads like Sean Hannity, influencers such as Ben Shapiro, and billionaires such as Bill Ackman. The saddest Part is, MAGA country zealots are too focused on demonizing blacks and immigrants to notice it. While MAGA country is busy trying to “own the libs”, a foreign country is owning them. I have accepted the fact that my life will be ruined by posting this comment. Last week Attorney General Pam Bondi  & Trump administration announced a Task Force to Combat Antisemitism. The task force is investigating allegations of antisemitism on university campuses. They will focus on the top 10 most prestigious universities. 2 months ago Trump signed an Executive Order to Combat Anti-Semitism. Last year  Joe Biden signed measures to fight antisemitism on college campuses. So why so many so many executives orders to protect the Jewish community? The Answer is AIPAC! AIPAC is the mostly powerful and the most corrupt lobby in America. It has corrupted half of elected politicians in DC and talking heads at Fox news. Elise Stefanik and Sean Hannity want you to believe it is antisemitic to talk about Israeli lobby corruption in out government? This is about the dangerous powers of an Israel, a foreign special interest group. The following states have passed legislation making it illegal to criticize Israel and..."

mov_B2B9D9CA671C162E611532B4CD2856F0,2025-07-10 09:01:03,en,WEB,"  Growing up in the Ocean State, the summer easily was my favorite time of the year. School was out and there always was something fun to do – like so many of you, I have incredible memories of daytime bike rides, Rocky Point and East Matunuck State Beach. But as I grew older, I came to know that the arrival of summer in Rhode Island brings more than sunshine and days by the water. It also elevates the critical needs of thousands of local families. For a lot of our neighbors, the start of summer means the end of reliable access to daily meals at school for their kids and structured childcare. It means already tight household budgets are stretched especially thin as families wrangle with the continued rising costs of utilities and the essential items they need every day. This is where United Way of Rhode Island's 211 steps in to help. Available 24/7 and in more than 200 dialects and languages, 211 connects Rhode Islanders with vital services and information all year long, but its impact during the summer is particularly profound. Through 211, families can quickly find nearby locations offering free meals through the Summer Food Service Program, which aims to ensure that no child goes hungry during school vacation. By calling 211, residents can locate cooling centers across the state when the temperature rises and the risk of heat-related illness grows. Connecting with 211 helps parents find affordable summer camp options, youth enrichment programs and farmers markets that accept SNAP benefits. And 211 is also an important resource when summer marks a turning point for household utility needs. When the state's utility moratorium on shutoffs ends in May and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program winds down, many households struggle to keep up with their electricity bill as air conditioning becomes a necessity. When this happens, calls to 211 for electric shutoff notices and energy assistance rise dramatically, which we saw during the record-breaking heatwave in late June. With every call they receive, trained 211 specialists listen with compassion and help callers navigate the options that connect Rhode Islanders with the emergency resources they need when the stakes are highest. And because 211 has the pulse on new programs – such as SUN Bucks, which offers summer grocery support to eligible families with kids –we are constantly growing our network of resources. The power of 211 lies not just in the breadth of its database, but also in the care with which it's delivered. This summer, and every season, 211 is a lifeline that bridges the gap between urgent need and timely support. When Rhode Islanders are unsure where to turn, 211 is there, and that makes all the difference. Cortney Nicolato is president and CEO of the United Way of Rhode Island."

mov_DC94EA846D6FCA5D7C6F8B6307A2776E,2025-07-10 11:15:00,en,WEB,"  Ulta Beauty's new chief executive officer Kecia Steelman continues to make significant moves, this time snapping up Space NK from investment firm Manzanita Capital. Terms of the deal were not disclosed apart from that the purchase was funded with cash on hand and capacity under Ulta's existing credit facility. More from WWD Press reports from last year suggested Manzanita was searching for a deal valued between 300 million pounds and 400 million pounds. Space NK, which has 83 stores in the U.K. and Ireland, will operate as a stand-alone subsidiary of Ulta Beauty and will continue to be led by its existing management team, including CEO Andy Lightfoot. “Today's announcement marks an exciting step forward for Ulta Beauty's global expansion efforts, adding the U.K. market to our existing planned openings in Mexico and the Middle East later this year,” said Steelman. “Space NK is a beloved brand with a strong operating model and customer loyalty, and we couldn't be more thrilled to welcome the brand into the Ulta Beauty family.” Space NK was founded in Covent Garden in 1993 by Nicky Kinnaird as a glossy destination for niche, international brands — many of them skin care — that were difficult to find in the U.K. It had been part of Manzanita Capital for 23 years. Reports that the firm was trying to sell Space NK emerged in April 2024. It previously tried to off-load it in 2018, before deciding to pull the retailer off the market. Bill Fisher, CEO and founder of Manzanita Capital, said: “I have every confidence that Ulta Beauty and this terrific management team will take Space NK to new heights.” Lightfoot added that he was excited by the opportunity to join Ulta Beauty and “benefit from its scale, brand relationships and resources.” “This acquisition sets both companies on a path to further success and importantly, enables us to reach more beauty enthusiasts throughout the world at scale. As a collective force of talented, passionate teams, I'm confident we will take Space NK to new heights,” he continued. The U.S. wholesale division of Space NK, which entails roughly 600 points of distribution across Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, Hudson's Bay and the company's shop-in-shop collaboration with Walmart and Beauty SpaceNK, was acquired by PCA Companies in June 2024. Since taking the reins as CEO of Ulta at the beginning of this year, Steelman has been executing its international expansion. Later this year Ulta will debut in Mexico through a joint venture with Axo, before arriving in the Middle East via a licensing agreement with Alshaya Group. In the Middle East, the first locations will be in Dubai and Kuwait City, with one store in each location to begin with, although the strategy is to expand quickly. It's the same story in Mexico. “We're getting ready to launch in the back half of 2025 for Mexico, and it will probably be in the later half of the year for the Middle East. For Mexico, it's a joint venture with Axo. We're very excited about our partnership. The teams are working very well together.

I'm Tom Ambrose and I'll be bringing you the latest news lines over the next hour or so. We start with news that a federal judge will consider today whether to prevent president Donald Trump's administration from enforcing his executive order limiting birthright citizenship after the US supreme court restricted the ability of judges to block his policies using nationwide injunctions. American Civil Liberties Union lawyers are set to ask US district judge Joseph Laplante at a hearing in Concord, New Hampshire, to grant class action status to a lawsuit they filed seeking to represent any babies whose citizenship status would be threatened by implementation of Trump's directive. Granting class status would empower Laplante, if he is inclined to do so, to issue a fresh judicial order blocking implementation of the Republican president's policy nationally. The ACLU and others filed the suit just hours after the Supreme Court on 27 June issued a 6-3 ruling, powered by its conservative majority, that narrowed three nationwide injunctions issued by judges in separate challenges to Trump's directive. The suit was filed on behalf of non-US citizens living in the United States whose babies might be affected. Under the Supreme Court's decision, Trump's executive order would take effect on 27 July. Looking to seize upon an exception in the Supreme Court's ruling, the lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the decision allows judges to continue to block Trump policies on a nationwide basis in class action lawsuits. In other developments: Donald Trump released an intemperate letter to Brazil's president imposing a 50% tariff and complaining about the prosecution of his friend, former president Jair Bolsonaro, for the crime of simply trying to stay in office despite losing an election and then inciting a riot by his supporters to derail the transfer of power. Brazil's current president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, rejected Trump's demand that the charges against Bolsonaro be dropped, and pointed out that Brazil has an independent judiciary and does not, in fact, have a trade imbalance with the US. Brazilians mocked Bolsonaro's potential successor for supporting Trump, by remixing video of him in a MAGA hat on social media. Amid concerns that a wave of staff reductions threaten the core missions of Nasa, Trump announced that he is asking the transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, to also serve as interim administrator of the space agency. Trump complimented the president of Liberia on his excellent English, revealing that he is unaware of that nation's close ties to the United States, as a home for freed slaves. The US supreme court maintained a judicial block on a Republican-crafted Florida law that makes it a crime for undocumented immigrants to enter the state.

Rubio faces a bit of a difficult task as he meets with foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean), Reuters reports. He must convince them that America is committed to the region while Trump is poised to impose tariffs on seven Asean countries. “It is our view, our strong view, and the reality that this century and the next, the story of the next 50 years, will largely be written here in this region, in this part of the world,” Rubio said at the gathering of Asean ministers. “When I hear … that perhaps the United States or the world might be distracted by events in other parts of the planet, I would say distraction is impossible.” Share Mark Hertsgaard The Democratic party and the climate movement have been “too cautious and polite” and should instead be denouncing the fossil fuel industry's “huge denial operation”, the US senator Sheldon Whitehouse said. “The fossil fuel industry has run the biggest and most malevolent propaganda operation the country has ever seen,” the Rhode Island Democrat said in an interview Monday with the global media collaboration Covering Climate Now. “It is defending a $700-plus billion [annual] subsidy” of not being charged for the health and environmental damages caused by burning fossil fuels. “I think the more people understand that, the more they'll be irate [that] they've been lied to.” But, he added, “Democrats have not done a good job of calling that out.” Whitehouse is among the most outspoken climate champions on Capitol Hill, and on Wednesday evening, he delivered his 300th Time to Wake Up climate speech on the floor of the Senate. He began giving these speeches in 2012, when Barack Obama was in his first term, and has consistently criticized both political parties for their lackluster response to the climate emergency. The Obama White House, he complained, for years would not even “use the word 'climate' and 'change' in the same paragraph”.

The Kansas City Chiefs star appeared in a plain white T-shirt featuring a small Yellowstone Club logo, a detail that didn't go unnoticed by Swifties. This has sparked fresh theories that it was a quiet nod to the pop star. Travis Kelce spotted paying tribute to Taylor Swift in his podcast Travis Kelce's clothes during the July 9 episode of his New Heights podcast have caught the attention of Taylor Swift fans. This fueled speculation about a quiet tribute to the pop star. While recording the episode with his brother Jason Kelce, the NFL player wore a simple white T-shirt bearing the logo of the Yellowstone Club, an exclusive Montana resort where he and Swift previously spent time together. In addition to the Yellowstone Club shirt, Kelce also sported a Cleveland Heights High School Tigers cap The Yellowstone Club, located in Big Sky, Montana, has become closely associated with the pair. They reportedly vacationed there in March and were seen dining at the exclusive resort with sports journalist Erin Andrews. It has been reported that Swift and Kelce have visited the club multiple times. One user posted a side-by-side comparison of Kelce's T-shirt and the Yellowstone Club logo, captioning it, “Shirt close enough.” Another joked , “I also like to get merch when I travel he's just like me.” Kelce's recent appearance in the shirt comes just days after reports surfaced that he and Swift returned to the private resort to celebrate the Fourth of July weekend. Known for hosting star-studded Independence Day parties at her Watch Hill estate in Rhode Island, Swift skipped her traditional gathering for the second year in a row. Instead, she opted for a quieter holiday with Kelce. As of now, neither Swift nor Kelce has commented publicly on the recent trip.

The state ranked No. 2 in last year's study, after topping the ranking in 2022 and 2023. The rating by the cable network has become an important marketing metric for the state's economic development officials. North Carolina remains only the second state named to the top spot back-to-back since CNBC started the rankings in 2007. CNBC's exclusive study scores the states on 135 metrics across 10 categories of competitiveness. The methodology is based on factors that companies consider when making site selection decisions. The economic development marketing pitches of every state are analyzed to determine the appropriate weight for each category. CNBC noted that North Carolina had a well-rounded performance, finishing in the top five in Economy, Workforce, and Business Friendliness, and ranking sixth in Education. It cited the state's momentum with JetZero announcing plans for a factory in Greensboro that may create as many as 14,500 jobs, along with Amazon's plan for a $10 billion data center in Richmond County. The state was ranked 29th for Quality of Life, which CNBC said stems from a lack of basic worker protections. The state is among the least unionized states. The highest-weighted categories are economic strength (17.8%), infrastructure (16.2%), workforce (13.4%), cost of doing business (11.8%) and business friendliness (10.8%). In previous years, CNBC has given the highest weight to infrastructure and workforce. “North Carolina has been on a roll for years now,” said CNBC's Scott Cohn, who oversees the study. “With its world-class workforce, a solid economy, and a heritage of innovation, North Carolina keeps winning business, and keeps winning our rankings.” Gov. Josh Stein appeared on CNBC to discuss the ranking. Texas, Florida, Virginia and Ohio rounded out the top four states in CNBC's study. Tennessee came in eighth, while South Carolina ranked 19th. The bottom five states were Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, Rhode Island and Louisiana."

In Swift's 12 years of owning a mansion in Watch Hill, she has thrown five celebrity-packed Independence Day parties, most recently hosting the traditional bash in 2023. While the popstar had no known events that coincided with July 4 this year, she did not return to the Ocean State for an Independence Day party, and instead enjoyed a lowkey weekend with boyfriend Travis Kelce. Here's where they stayed. According to reports on social media, Swift traded an oceanside Rhode Island bash for a quiet Montana getaway this Fourth of July. The singer was reportedly spotted with Travis Kelce at Yellowstone Club, an exclusive, secluded resort spanning across 15,200 acres of the northern Rock Mountains in Big Sky. Yellowstone Club offers custom residences, ranches and multi-family homes, according to the resort's website. Luxurious amenities include a fitness club, a spa and 16 different on-site restaurants, ranging in cuisine from continental breakfast to cantina-style Mexican. Activities include kayaking, paddle boarding, hiking and mountain biking on private trails, ice skating, skiing and golfing on an exclusive 18-hole course. Following the holiday weekend, fans were quick to notice that Kelce wore a Yellowstone Club shirt in the July 9 episode of the ""New Heights"" podcast with his brother Jason Kelce. Over the years, Swift has become known for her iconic Independence Day bashes in Rhode Island, dubbed ""Taymerica"" parties by her fans. After buying her Rhode Island house in 2013, Swift threw parties for the holiday for four years in a row, hosting members of her ""squad"" like Blake Lively, Gigi Hadid, Cara Delevingne, Ed Sheeran, Lena Dunham and Emma Stone. From 2017 to 2022, Swift took a break from celebrating the Fourth in Rhode Island, leading many fans to question if the singer's holiday tradition was over. However, in 2023, Taylor Swift once again returned to Rhode Island for July 4, celebrating with Selena Gomez and Haim sisters Este, Alana and Danielle. ""Happy belated Independence Day from your local neighborhood independent girlies,"" Swift captioned an Instagram post featuring pictures of the friends posing in front of the water, laughing in the kitchen and enjoying red, white and blue popsicles. Last year, the popstar was unable to throw a Rhode Island party due to being in Europe for the Eras Tour, where she played a show at Johan Cruyff Arena in Amsterdam on July 4, 2024. Instead, Swift returned to her New England mansion in August 2024 for a late summer bash in honor of Blake Lively's birthday, which was attended by Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds, Bradley Cooper, Travis Kelce, Jason and Kylie Kelce and Patrick and Brittany Mahomes."

Congressional maps are usually redrawn at the start of each decade, after the decennial census, to account for population shifts. But Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced on Wednesday that the state legislature would take up redrawing the maps in an upcoming special session. The announcement came after Donald Trump's political team urged Texas to redraw the maps to try and pick up Republican seats. Republicans already hold 25 of the state's 38 congressional seats. In order to pick up more seats, they will likely have to move Republican voters out of safe GOP districts into Democratic ones. That could wind up backfiring by making those solidly Republican districts more competitive in years when Democrats do well.

Judge to weigh blocking Trump on birthright citizenship despite supreme court ruling 12:44 Hello and welcome to the US politics live blog. I'm Tom Ambrose and I'll be bringing you the latest news lines over the next hour or so. We start with news that a federal judge will consider today whether to prevent president Donald Trump's administration from enforcing his executive order limiting birthright citizenship after the US supreme court restricted the ability of judges to block his policies using nationwide injunctions. American Civil Liberties Union lawyers are set to ask US district judge Joseph Laplante at a hearing in Concord, New Hampshire, to grant class action status to a lawsuit they filed seeking to represent any babies whose citizenship status would be threatened by implementation of Trump's directive. Granting class status would empower Laplante, if he is inclined to do so, to issue a fresh judicial order blocking implementation of the Republican president's policy nationally. The ACLU and others filed the suit just hours after the Supreme Court on 27 June issued a 6-3 ruling, powered by its conservative majority, that narrowed three nationwide injunctions issued by judges in separate challenges to Trump's directive. The suit was filed on behalf of non-US citizens living in the United States whose babies might be affected. Under the Supreme Court's decision, Trump's executive order would take effect on 27 July. Looking to seize upon an exception in the Supreme Court's ruling, the lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the decision allows judges to continue to block Trump policies on a nationwide basis in class action lawsuits. In other developments: Donald Trump released an intemperate letter to Brazil's president imposing a 50% tariff and complaining about the prosecution of his friend, former president Jair Bolsonaro, for the crime of simply trying to stay in office despite losing an election and then inciting a riot by his supporters to derail the transfer of power.

Amid concerns that a wave of staff reductions threaten the core missions of Nasa, Trump announced that he is asking the transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, to also serve as interim administrator of the space agency. Trump complimented the president of Liberia on his excellent English, revealing that he is unaware of that nation's close ties to the United States, as a home for freed slaves.

tw_sl_ee70bc409ac6ae484183d923e8d746b3,2025-07-10 16:23:23,en,WEB,"  NEWPORT, R.I. — Brittany Spurgas's mother died of breast cancer at age 39. Her grandmother suffered from cervical cancer, which can be detected by getting regular screenings. But weeks before Spurgas's annual OB-GYN appointment, where she would get that screening, she received a call telling her it had been postponed. “They said it was because of Rhode Island's ongoing health care crises, but didn't provide any other details,” said Spurgas. “I said I have a longstanding history of cancer in my family and it's very important for me to have these annual exams.” “The lady said, 'You're one of many that has the same kind of story and a lot of you are being impacted, but you'll have to wait,' ” said Spurgas. These cancellations are part of a wider problem within Rhode Island's health care system, where a primary care shortage is reaching a tipping point. In April, Anchor Medical abruptly shut down, leaving more than 25,000 patients scrambling for new primary care doctors. Providence Community Health Centers, which relies heavily on public insurance, laid off dozens of workers in May, citing low Medicaid reimbursement rates. Spurgas is one of at least 300 women with annual OB-GYN appointments scheduled at the Newport Women's Health Services at Newport Hospital who received a phone call in the last week saying their check-ups had been unexpectedly postponed. Newport Hospital is owned and operated by the largest health care system in the state — Brown University Health, formerly known as Lifespan Corp. Brown Health also operates two of Steward Health Care's former hospitals across the border in Massachusetts: Morton Hospital in Taunton and Saint Anne's in Fall River. Suzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff Brown Health spokeswoman Jessica Wharton told the Globe that Newport Women's Health Services was down to just two practitioners, and a new gynecologist wasn't expected to begin working until October. “We made the difficult decision to temporarily reschedule annual OB-GYN wellness visits originally scheduled for July through September to ensure that we can continue to provide timely and essential care to those with urgent, complex, or high-risk medical needs, including pregnant patients and those with active or serious gynecological concerns,” Wharton said in a statement. Spurgas said she was told that she would be placed on a waitlist in October. But she may seek out care sooner, by finding a new provider in Massachusetts. “I was in shock. They wouldn't explain at all what was going on,” said Spurgas. “They just kept saying that it was because of Rhode Island's health care crisis. It was very vague.” Earlier this year, Brown Health's executives were considering closing down a dental center, halting major facility projects at Rhode Island Hospital, and discontinuing labor and delivery services at Newport Hospital in order to save money, according to an email sent by top Brown Health leaders to its managers in May that was obtained by the Globe. The budget problems are not unique to Rhode Island's hospitals, and could become more critical in the coming months. Healthcare providers throughout New England will be affected by impending cuts to Medicaid through the “One Big Beautiful Bill” that was signed by President Trump on July 4 that could also translate into more expensive care, reduced services, and longer waits across the region. Executives at UMass Memorial Health in Worcester told the Globe they may be forced to cut medical services that are considered money-losers, like pediatrics, obstetrics, psychiatry, and primary care. Many women who do not have an OB-GYN, or cannot afford one, seek reproductive care at Planned Parenthood clinics. But Planned Parenthood will also lose millions from Trump's new law: the Planned Parenthood League of Massachusetts will lose $14 million, which is about half of its operating budget, and Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, which oversees clinics in Rhode Island and Connecticut, will lose about $12 million. While some Planned Parenthood clinics provide abortion services, the organization offers a wide range of sexual and reproductive health services, including birth control, testing and treatment for sexually transmitted diseases, and cancer screenings. “Defunding is an attempt by lawmakers to make Planned Parenthood stop caring for patients and stop caring about reproductive freedom,” said Gretchen Raffa, chief policy and advocacy office of Planned Parenthood of Southern New England, during a virtual press conference on Monday. “Make no mistake, this is a covert attack.” At Newport Women's Health Services, visits for new and existing prenatal patients, as well as those with high-risk pregnancies or other medical concerns, are unaffected. Experts say those whose routine checkups were postponed should not be worried about the delayed appointments, but should make sure to reschedule them. “Anyone who has an appointment for a Pap or HPV test that is cancelled should just be clear on what the follow-up plan might be, in terms of why it was taken off the books and if they should reschedule, either with their current provider or someone else,” said Fred Wyand, a senior advisor for the American Sexual Health Association/National Cervical Cancer Coalition. Cervical cancer tends to develop over a number of years, and not all women need to be screened annually, he said. “If you have a Pap scheduled for Tuesday and for whatever reason you can't receive it, you won't develop cancer on Wednesday, but you don't want to fall out of the system.” “That's what can happen, we lose the consistency and the regular screenings, and that's really when it can become risky,” he added."

Send this article to your social connections. White kitchen cabinets have been in vogue for longer than anyone can remember, but buyers of new construction have moved on to earthier tones. And that's not all they want. As of July 8, there were 743 new single-family homes listed for sale in Greater Boston, according to figures compiled by ERA Key Realty, which has 15 offices across the region. The median list price was $1,150,000, but goes up as high as $13.85 million. For that kind of money, buyers want some extras. Chris Doherty, broker/owner of Doherty Properties in Lowell, said in addition to different cabinet colors, people who buy new or renovated homes today increasingly expect technology that makes their lives more convenient. “They want the latest thermostat that they can control from their phone, if they want to,'' he said. “They're looking for security like doorbell cameras and other cameras. Not everything necessarily has to be connected to the internet, but they want smart home readiness.'' He said the open floor concept is still very popular, too, as people move away from separate formal dining rooms to an eating area visible from and adjacent to the kitchen. “People want to be able to be cooking in the kitchen and still be able to see what's happening in the living room or the family room,'' Doherty said. “They want to be able to see guests intermingle. They want to be able to entertain. They want spaces that just flow. High cathedral ceilings and an open floor plan.'' “Granite countertops used to be the big thing, he said. “Now, it seems to be quartz. And gray is dead. Everybody wanted gray, right? They put gray floors into every new house. Now I'm seeing a return to the earth tones.'' Doherty said two full bathrooms will no longer cut it with today's home buyers, either. “It's got to have two and a half baths minimum,'' he said. “They want that half bathroom on the first floor and they want a full, primary bathroom off the main bedroom and they're going to want a common full upstairs.'' Agents said buyers of newly constructed homes don't voice a preference for “green'' features because many are required by the Massachusetts Energy Code, which mandates new construction must align with the state's goal of net-zero emissions by 2050. Doherty said lowering annual energy and exterior maintenance costs are selling points. “People like tankless water heaters because the energy cost is lower with them,'' he said. “In the higher end, we're even seeing some turf in parts of the lawn because they don't want to have to maintain a large lawn.'' Teri Adler, an agent in the MetroWest area with MGS Real Estate Group, was in the midst of a renovation of her own home when she was interviewed for this story. She said in the luxury market, yards are still important, at least enough yard or patio space for outdoor entertainment. She said most buyers are looking for Colonials, but there is a smaller pool that likes a more modern design. “Pre-COVID, three-season porches were a throwaway — no one really cared about them,'' she said. “Now you hear gasps when people see a really nice three-season porch. People are spending more time in their yards.'' Adler cited other features that became more important during and after COVID. “I hear a lot of buyers ask for golf simulators,'' she said. “A home gym is also super important — people like the option to work out at home. And a private office is very important on the first floor, but away from the center of the household. Some people want two offices. If an office is missing on the first floor plan, people take notice.'' She said people really respond to having warm spaces throughout their new homes. “Radiant heat in a mudroom is kind of nice,'' she said. “They want very warm spaces. The days of cool grays seem to be gone, and more earthy colors and materials is really at play now.''..."
mov_99BC1080EFCBDDA8484A8FE3D01A4F58,2025-07-10 16:46:22,en,WEB,"  RICHMOND, Va. — New VCU head coach Phil Martelli Jr. is quickly learning what it means to be part of the Rams program just months into his tenure. Martelli, who joined VCU after coaching at Bryant College, told me he's been impressed by the level of community support for the program. ""I knew that it was a passionate, knowledgeable fan base. I didn't realize to what level that passion and that knowledge goes to. It's really been super exciting to be around that,"" Martelli said. The new coach has been busy assembling his team through the transfer portal, bringing in nine new faces including transfers from UConn, Oregon and LSU. Despite the challenges of modern college basketball's constant player movement, Martelli feels comfortable with the process. ""Now it's very different, right? It's guys transferring up, it's guys transferring across levels. It's guys transferring for various reasons. Some are for playing time, some are for money, some are for all these different things. And I just have a comfort in it, like it's not something that scares me,"" Martelli said. ""Unfortunately, that revolving door is not going anywhere, but at a place like VCU, that slows down quite a bit, because this is a destination type place."" Family connections run deep in Martelli's coaching staff, with his brother Jimmy serving as an assistant coach. ""It's huge. Jimmy's knowledge of VCU, his knowledge of Richmond and the surrounding area is invaluable. But the way that he goes about his business, how organized he is, how detailed he is, you know, all the things that are really important to me, he's got all those qualities. And he's a monster on the recruiting trail,"" Martelli said. When asked what he would change about college basketball, Martelli offered a potentially controversial take. ""This one won't make me super, super popular with a lot of people, but I would eliminate the charge altogether. I would eliminate the charge make it more like the NBA, where it's more at the rim and plays at the rim,"" Martelli said. The coach also believes college basketball will soon shift from two halves to four quarters to align with other levels of the game. Martelli shared a personal connection to VCU, recalling how the university honored his grandfather after his passing during a game years ago. ""I very much knew about that story that meant a lot to all of us. That was a really hard time. My grandfather, Pop, he was at every practice. He went on every road trip. So he's always with us. He's always in our spirit,"" Martelli said. That memory helped confirm for Martelli that VCU was the right opportunity. ""100% Yeah 100%. I mean, that's and that has been solidified every day that I've been here. There were other phone calls that just were like, 'Yeah, that's not, I'm not.' But when this call came, it was you didn't even have to think about it. You just reacted like 'Yes,' and that's been the right decision all the way through,"" Martelli said. Martelli is particularly looking forward to facing Rhode Island this season, which will serve as a homecoming for him and his family given their ties to nearby Bryant College."
mov_0E895BBE9E1EB07E32FC1FE3951B1930,2025-07-10 17:00:37,en,WEB,"  ABSTRACT The intended target, who was not injured, has a ""lengthy criminal record and known gang affiliations in Massachusetts,"" Cranston police said. FULL TEXT PROVIDENCE - Two men were arrested following a ""brazen"" shooting Wednesday morning targeting a Massachusetts man with known gang affiliations at a popular outdoor shopping center in suburban Cranston, R.I., police said. Andres Pizarro, 31, of Fall River, and Andre Ross, 31, of Pawtucket, R.I., each face several charges filed by Cranston police and Rhode Island State Police, officials said. According to Cranston police, officers responded to multiple reports of gunfire in front of the Verizon store inside Garden City Center around 11:46 a.m. Wednesday. A retired State Police lieutenant who witnessed the shooting reported a man dressed in black fired several rounds at another man, who fled inside the store to take cover, officials said. ""A surveillance video shows the suspects waiting near LA Fitness for an extended period before ambushing the victim as he exited the gym,"" police said. ""The shooter fired five rounds at close range while the target attempted to flee, ultimately taking shelter inside a nearby business."" No injuries were reported, according to police. According to authorities, the apparent target of the shooting ""refused to cooperate with investigators."" Police did not publicly identify the man, but said he has a ""lengthy criminal record and known gang affiliations in Massachusetts."" Witnesses provided police details of the suspects' vehicle, described as a ""green/gray Kia with Massachusetts license plates,"" which officials later determined was stolen from Swansea, Mass., officials said. The description was shared with other law enforcement in the region and ""within minutes, the Rhode Island State Police located the vehicle on Route 6 and initiated a pursuit, which continued through the Smith Hill neighborhood of Providence,"" authorities said. The chase ended in the Providence Place Mall parking garage, where both suspects attempted to flee on foot, and were apprehended by Providence police and State Police, officials said. One of the men was found with a .25-caliber handgun, police said. Authorities intend to conduct ballistic testing to confirm whether the firearm ""matches the shell casings recovered at the scene,"" police said. According to officials, both Pizarro and Ross have ""extensive criminal histories involving violent and narcotics-related offenses."" As of late Wednesday night, both were being held at State Police headquarters and were scheduled to be arraigned Thursday morning in Providence County District Court, police said. ""This brazen act of targeted violence at one of our city's busiest and most vibrant shopping destinations is unprecedented in my tenure as chief,"" Cranston Police Chief Michael Winquist, who started the job in 2014, said in a statement. ""While the intended victim was clearly targeted, it is incredibly fortunate that no innocent bystanders were harmed."" Pizarro was charged by Cranston police with six charges, including assault with intent to commit a specified felony, felony assault with a dangerous weapon, and discharge of a firearm while committing a crime of violence. Ross was charged by Cranston police with intent to commit a specified felony, felony assault with a dangerous weapon, and two counts of felony conspiracy. Both men also face State Police charges."

mov_C17E690C277D6F91802164AEB4056712,2025-07-10 17:08:03,en,WEB,"  As an Afro-Latina woman with degrees in computer and electrical engineering, Maya De Los Santos hopes to buck a trend by forging a career in AI, a field dominated by white men. AI needs her, experts and observers say. Built-in viewpoints and bias, unintentionally imbued by its creators, can make the fast-growing digital tool risky as it is used to make significant decisions in areas such as hiring processes, health care, finance and law enforcement, they warn. ""I'm interested in a career in AI because I want to ensure that marginalized communities are protected from and informed on the dangers and risks of AI and also understand how they can benefit from it,"" said De Los Santos, a first-generation U.S. college student. ""This unfairness and prejudice that exists in society is being replicated in the AI brought into very high stakes scenarios and environment, and it's being trusted, without more critical thinking."" Women represent 26% of the AI workforce, according to a UNESCO report, and men hold 80% of tenured faculty positions at university AI departments globally. Blacks and Hispanics also are underrepresented in the AI workforce, a 2022 census data analysis by Georgetown University showed. Among AI technical occupations, Hispanics held about 9% of jobs, compared with holding more than 18% of U.S. jobs overall, it said. Black workers held about 8% of the technical AI jobs, compared with holding nearly 12% of U.S. jobs overall, it said. AI bias De Los Santos will soon begin a PhD program in human computer interaction at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. She said she wants to learn not only how to educate marginalized communities on AI technology but to understand privacy issues and AI bias, also called algorithm or machine learning bias, that produces results that reflect and perpetuate societal biases. Bias has unintentionally seeped into some AI systems as software engineers, for example, who are creating problem-solving techniques integrate their own perspectives and often-limited data sets. Amazon.com scrapped an AI recruiting tool when it found it was selecting resumes favoring men over women. The system had been trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most came from men, a reflection of a preponderance of men across the industry, and the system in effect taught itself that male candidates were preferable. ""When people from a broader range of life experiences, identities and backgrounds help shape AI, they're more likely to identify different needs, ask different questions and apply AI in new ways,"" said Tess Posner, founding CEO of AI4ALL, a non-profit working to develop an inclusive pipeline of AI professionals. ""Inclusion makes the solutions created by AI more relevant to more people,"" said Posner. PROMOTING DIVERSITY AI4ALL counts De Los Santos as one of the 7,500 students it has helped navigate the barriers to getting a job in AI since 2015. By targeting historically underrepresented groups, the non-profit aims to diversify the AI workforce. AI engineer jobs are one of the fastest growing positions globally and the fastest growing overall in the U.S. and the United Kingdom, according to LinkedIn. Posner said promoting diversity means starting early in education by expanding access to computer science classes for children. About 60% of public high schools offer such classes with Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans less likely to have access. Ensuring that students from underrepresented groups know about AI as a potential career, creating internships and aligning them with mentors is critical, she said, Efforts to make AI more representative of American society are colliding with President Donald Trump's backlash against Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) programs in the federal government, higher education and corporate levels. DEI offices and programs in the U.S. government have been terminated and federal contractors banned from using affirmative action in hiring. Companies from Goldman Sachs to PepsiCo have halted or cut back diversity programs. Safiya Noble, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles and founder of the Center on Resilience & Digital Justice, said she worries the government's attack on DEI will undermine efforts to create opportunities in AI for marginalized groups. ""One of the ways to repress any type of progress on civil rights is to make the allegation that tech and social media companies have been too available to the messages of civil rights and human rights,"" said Noble. ""You see the evidence with their backlash against movements like Blacks Lives Matter and allegations of anti-conservative bias,"" she said. Globally, from 2021 to 2024, UNESCO says the number of women working in AI increased by just 4 percent. While progress may be slow, Posner said she is optimistic. ""There's been a lot of commitment to these values of inclusion,"" she said. ""I don't think that's changed, even if as a society, we are wrestling with what inclusion really means and how to do that across the board."""

1F064B6E98F54CC6586BD89E31680FCF,2025-07-10 18:26:27,en,PRINT,"  Digital price labels, which are rapidly replacing paper shelf tags at U.S. supermarkets, haven't led to demand-based pricing surges, according to a new study that examined five years' worth of prices at one grocery chain. But some shoppers, consumer advocates and lawmakers remain skeptical about the tiny electronic screens, which let stores change prices instantly from a central computer instead of having workers swap out paper labels by hand. “It's corporations vs. the humans, and that chasm between us goes further and further,” said Dan Gallant, who works in sports media in Edmonton, Canada. Gallant's local Loblaws supermarket recently switched to digital labels. Dynamic pricing strategy Social media is filled with warnings that grocers will use the technology to charge more for ice cream if it's hot outside, hike the price of umbrellas if it's raining or to gather information about customers. Democratic U.S. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Bob Casey of Pennsylvania fired off a letter to Kroger last fall demanding to know whether it would use its electronic labels as part of a dynamic pricing strategy. Lawmakers in Rhode Island and Maine have introduced bills to limit the use of digital labels. In Arizona, Democratic state Rep. Cesar Aguilar recently introduced a bill that would ban them altogether. The bill hasn't gotten a hearing, but Aguilar said he's determined to start a conversation about digital labels and how stores could abuse them. “Grocery stores study when people go shopping the most. And so you might be able to see a price go down one day and then go up another day,” Aguilar said. Labels safe, researchers say Researchers say those fears are misplaced. A study published in late May found “virtually no surge pricing” before or after electronic shelf labels were adopted. The study was authored by Ioannis Stamatopoulos of the University of Texas, Austin, Robert Evan Sanders of the University of California, San Diego, and Robert Bray of Northwestern University. The researchers looked at prices between 2019 and 2024 at an unidentified grocery chain that began using digital labels in October 2022. They found that temporary price increases affected 0.005% of products on any given day before electronic shelf labels were introduced, a share that increased by only 0.0006 percentage points after digital labels were installed. Economists have long wondered why grocery prices don't change more often, according to Stamatopoulos. If bananas are about to expire, for example, it makes sense to lower the price on them. He said the cost of having workers change prices by hand could be one issue. But there's another reason: Shoppers watch grocery prices closely, and stores don't want to risk angering them. “Selling groceries is not selling a couch. It's not a one-time transaction and you will never see them again,” Stamatopoulos said. Electronic price labels aren't new. They've been in use for more than a decade at grocery stores in Europe and some U.S. retailers, like Kohl's. But they've been slow to migrate to U.S. grocery stores. Only about 5% to 10% of U.S. supermarkets now have electronic labels, compared to 80% in Europe, said Amanda Oren, vice president of industry strategy for North American grocery at Relex Solutions, a technology company that helps retailers forecast demand. Oren said cost is one issue that has slowed the U.S. rollout. The tiny screens cost between $5 and $20, Oren said, but every product a store sells needs one, and the average supermarket has 100,000 or more individual products. Still, the U.S. industry is charging ahead. Walmart, the nation's largest grocer and retailer, hopes to have digital price labels at 2,300 U.S. stores by 2026. Kroger is expanding the use of digital labels this year after testing them at 20 stores. Supermarket chains tout benefits Companies say electronic price labels have tremendous advantages. Walmart says it used to take employees two days to change paper price labels on the 120,000 items it has in a typical store. With digital tags, it takes a few minutes. The labels also can be useful. Some have codes shoppers can scan to see recipes or nutrition information. Instacart has a system in thousands of U.S. stores, including Aldi and Schnucks, that flashes a light on the digital tag when Instacart shoppers are nearby to help them find products. Since 2022, Ahold Delhaize's Albert Heijn supermarket chain in the Netherlands and Belgium has been testing an artificial intelligence-enabled tool that marks down prices on its digital labels every 15 minutes for products nearing expiration. The system has reduced more than 250 tons of food waste annually, the company said."

The act, which was submitted on behalf of the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner, provides several new protections related to Medicare Supplement Insurance, or Medigap. It also aligns Rhode Island's Medicare supplement market with other states in the region. These plans help Medicare patients cover out-of-pocket costs that their original plans do not cover. “Addressing Medicare supplement coverage, which can be complicated and difficult to navigate, is extremely important to ensuring seniors can get the best possible care while protecting their financial security,” said President Lawson (D-Dist. 14, East Providence). “In 2023, I was proud to sponsor a law protecting seniors from denial of, or higher rates for, supplemental Medicare coverage based on pre-existing conditions. This legislation to create new consumer protections will provide additional consistency in the market and expand choice for Rhode Islanders, and I am grateful to OHIC and Commissioner Cory King for their work on this issue. Making health care accessible and affordable for all Rhode Islanders, including seniors, continues to be a top priority for me and my Senate colleagues.” Learn more: https://rilegislature.gov/pressrelease/_layouts/15/ril.pressrelease.inputform/DisplayForm.aspx?List=c8baae31-3c10-431c-8dcd-9dbbe21ce3e9&ID=375827"

Leading up to the Golfweek New England Junior on July 8-9 at Ledgefield Country Club in Seekonk, Massachusetts, Constantine played an AJGA event at Chicopee (Massachusetts) Country Club. “Didn't have my best showing,” said Constantine, who is about to enter his senior year of high school, “but practiced leading up to this and was able to put up some low numbers, got my ballstriking a little better and putting was definitely better.” Constantine, who lives in Franklin, Massachusetts, and attends Xaverian High School, missed the cut at the AJGA tournament, but he turned it around quickly to fire rounds of 74-71-70 and then go on to win the Golfweek event on the first hole of a playoff. “Didn't have my best ballstriking and I was able to get up and down from a lot of places and that saved me a lot,” he said after the Golfweek tournament. Storms over Ledgefield produced enough lightning to cause significant delays on Tuesday, the opening 36-hole day. Players had to finish their second round on Wednesday before the final round began. Constantine played 25 holes on Wednesday before finishing off the title in the playoff. He had to get past AJ Bodnar of North Andover, Massachusetts, on the extra hole after Bodnar used rounds of 71-73-71 to tie Constantine at 2 over for the event. Last month, Bodnar advanced through U.S. Junior qualifying and will tee it up at the tournament proper on July 21-26. Perhaps the most heroic part of Constantine's victory was the playoff itself. This isn't his first playoff victory, but it was a memorable one. He hit driver on the drivable par-4 14th and left himself with a chip onto the green from about 30 yards. That shot nearly rolled in for eagle – the ball even hit the flagstick – and it set up an easy birdie for the win. “I knew it would be tough to stop going down that hill and kind of got a little lucky hitting the stick but happy it stayed close,” Constantine said about that chip shot. Constantine hopes to play college golf, he just isn't sure where yet. In the final weeks before he begins his senior year, he plans to play a few more United State Challenge Cup events. Behind Constantine and Bodnar, Parker Kroll was third with a 4-over total. The East Greenwich, Rhode Island, resident made up ground in the final round with a closing 70. Tyler Dearborn of Sherborn, Massachusetts, finished fourth, another shot back. In the girls division, Junyi (Judy) Wu from Beijing capped off a four-shot victory when she posted rounds of 73-76-73 for a 6-over total. Wu began to pull away on the back nine of the opening round when she made three birdies in her final four holes and she never looked back. Interestingly, Wu didn't even think she had her best stuff this week, particularly around the greens. She called her short game “horrible” but noted that her long game is very strong and that she was also able to hit a lot of greens in regulation. “I think the golf course is very [suited] for me – the greens and the fairways – because I think there are a lot of left doglegs and I always play a draw,” she said after the final round. Wu, who will graduate high school in Beijing in the spring, has already verbally committed to play college golf at Amherst College, an NCAA Division III school in Amherst, Massachusetts. She arrived in the U.S. at the end of May to play a summer schedule of tournaments. In mid-June, she won the Connecticut Junior PGA Championship at Keney Park Golf Course in Windsor, Connecticut. Both wins, Wu thinks, should give her more confidence on the golf course, especially when things don't go exactly her way. “I think I should relax,” she said, “and accept all my mistakes.”"

The investigation hinges on a policy issued earlier this month by the Minnesota Department of Human Services mandating that hiring supervisors provide a “hiring justification when seeking to hire a non-underrepresented candidate,” according to a Thursday letter sent to Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison from Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, head of the DOJ's Civil Rights Division. Attorney General Pam Bondi's DOJ has pursued an aggressive crackdown on states and universities that engage in affirmative action policies, opening similar investigations into Rhode Island and the University of California. “Minnesotans deserve to have their state government employees hired based on merit, not based on illegal DEI,” Bondi said in a statement. The White House has repeatedly clashed with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, who has sharply criticized the president since running for vice president on the Democratic ticket in 2024. Ellison has also filed multiple lawsuits against the Trump administration seeking to block several of its policies, and the DOJ sued Minnesota last month to stop the state from providing in-state tuition for some undocumented students. Trump also refused to call Walz after two Minnesota state lawmakers were shot in May, calling the governor “so whacked out.” Walz's office and the Minnesota Department of Human Services did not immediately respond to requests for comment, and Ellison's office declined to comment."

(WPRI) — A bill signed into law by Governor Dan McKee on July 3 created a Rare Disease Advisory Council in Rhode Island. Co-sponsor state Senator Val Lawson and Warwick mom Erin Vazquez joined Shannon Hegy on 12 Health to talk about why this council was needed and who it will benefit. According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, families and individuals with uncommon diseases often face a number of obstacles, from misdiagnosis and lack of treatment options to insurance issues and limited access to specialists. Lawson told 12 Health Rhode Island's new Rare Disease Advisory Council will be comprised of stakeholders who aim to help people navigate those hurdles and increase awareness. ""It's all those people that you want to have input,"" Lawson said, explaining that the council will be made up of an academic who specializes in rare diseases, a representative from the state Department of Health, a registered nurse, a physician, a hospital administrator, two patients, a caregiver, a pharmacist, and a representative from the National Organization for Rare Disorders. ""All the areas that are touched by rare diseases, there's a stakeholder or two, so we can get input and inform everyone as well as the public,"" she said. Vazquez's son, Landon, was diagnosed two years ago with a rare autoimmune disease that causes him to bleed into his lungs. She told 12 Health she would have appreciated having a council like that on her side during the family's long and emotional journey to Landon's diagnosis. ""I think the biggest part of it is the education,"" she said. ""We had no resources available to us for what he had, and the team of doctors who diagnosed him didn't even know how to treat him from there."" ""Resources alone, I think, would be huge, just thinking of myself and other parents who are going through similar situations,"" she added.

On Thursday, July 10, attorney Elizabeth Crawford of Kline & Specter, PC, who represented the plaintiffs in all four cases, confirmed to PEOPLE that “the matters have all been resolved,” and declined to elaborate. Panera also acknowledged the settlements, initially reported by NBC News, and offered no further comment. The controversial drink first drew national attention in October 2023, when the parents of 21-year-old University of Pennsylvania student Sarah Katz filed a wrongful death lawsuit. Katz, who had a pre-existing heart condition, went into cardiac arrest after drinking a Charged Lemonade, according to the complaint. That same month, the lawsuit was “dismissed with prejudice.” Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Dispensers for Charged Lemondade at Panera Bread Additional lawsuits soon followed. According to previous reports by PEOPLE, one filed by the family of 46-year-old Dennis Brown alleged he died after consuming three Charged Lemonades in one visit. Brown had a chromosomal disorder and high blood pressure, and typically avoided energy drinks, his family alleged in court documents. Two more cases involved individuals who survived but suffered lasting health effects. One suit claimed that 28-year-old Rhode Island resident Lauren Skerritt, an occupational therapist with no prior medical issues, developed permanent cardiac injuries after drinking multiple Charged Lemonades in April 2023. Another, filed on behalf of Pennsylvania teen Luke Adams, alleged he had to be resuscitated hours after consuming the beverage, PEOPLE reported at the time. All three cases were “dismissed with prejudice” earlier this week, meaning they cannot be refiled. The lawsuits filed against Panera described Charged Lemonade as a “dangerous energy drink” and accused the restaurant chain of failing to adequately warn customers. A large 30 oz. cup, when served without ice, contained 390 milligrams of caffeine — nearly the FDA's recommended daily limit for healthy adults — in addition to the stimulant, guarana extract. More in U.S. Panera has denied liability in the lawsuits but made several changes after the initial filing in 2023. The company removed Charged Lemonade from self-serve stations, added warning signage, and, by May 2024, pulled the beverage from menus entirely as part of what it called a “menu transformation.” “We listened to more than 30,000 guests about what they wanted from Panera,” the company said in a statement to PEOPLE at the time, noting a shift toward drinks with “low sugar and low-caffeine options.” Before its removal, Panera's website listed 260 milligrams of caffeine in a regular-sized Charged Lemonade, and 390 milligrams in a large, similar to the chain's Dark Roast coffee. Following the lawsuits, signage in some Panera locations instructed customers to request the drink at the counter rather than serving themselves. It remains unclear whether all self-serve stations have been fully phased out of all dine-in locations."

From Rosie O'Donnell's confusing storyline in episode 1 to Ryan Serhant's surprising cameo, the season has followed much more than just the four best friends. And, among the newcomers, is Logan Marshall-Green, who is playing Carrie's (Sarah Jessica Parker) gardener, Adam, in her brand new Gramercy Park townhouse. From the get-go, his sarcastic character brought a new energy to the screen. While viewers might've tried to scope out a vibe between him and Carrie, things clearly took a turn when Seema (Sarita Choudhury) entered the picture and immediately matched his humor. “I'm Adam, I'm also known as New York's plant Picasso,” he says, trying to impress her. “I'm Seema, also known as Carrie's Virginia plus one,” she says back.

He's Directed Before According to IMDb, Marshall-Green made his directorial debut in 2019 with the touching movie Adopt a Highway, starring Ethan Hawke. The movie, which Marshall-Green also wrote, follows a lost ex-felon who finds a baby in a dumpster while struggling to restart his life.

mov_BE24905E18F2DE787C7215076A01A90E,2025-07-11 02:30:41,en,WEB,"  July 10th, 2025 ( The Cheat Sheet  - Delivered by  Newstex ) Justin Bieber has been stirring headlines lately amid swirling rumors of erratic behavior, marital strain with wife Hailey Bieber, and unverified allegations of substance use. Despite the drama, Justin announced his surprise seventh studio album, Swag, scheduled for release on July 11, 2025, under Def Jam. The announcement was teased via cryptic 'Swag' billboards in Los Angeles, Reykjavik, and Times Square, a tracklist revealed on Instagram, and family portraits featuring Hailey and their 10-month-old son, Jack. And Hailey has a strong message for the Justin haters. Here's what she posted. Justin Bieber's new album, 'Swag,' marks his first album since 2021 Justin Bieber is back at the center of the spotlight, this time not for controversy, but for music. Rumors of personal turmoil have swirled recently, fueled by  speculation about marital setbacks and emotional strain. Amid the chatter, Justin has unveiled teasers for his seventh studio album, Swag, through cryptic billboards that popped up in Los Angeles, Reykjavk, and Times Square on July 10, 2025, according to The Hollywood Reporter. The posters, blotched with the single word 'Swag,' appeared alongside glimpses of a tracklist including songs like 'All I Can Take,' 'Walking Away,' 'Dadz Love,' and 'Forgiveness.' While neither Bieber nor Def Jam has yet confirmed an official release date, industry insiders suggest the album could drop as soon as this Friday, July 11. From the looks of it, Swag is shaping up to be his most introspective and genre-blending project to date. With 20 tracks and high-profile features from Gunna, Sexyy Red, and Cash Cobain, Bieber seems poised to depart from his polished pop roots and embrace a darker, more vulnerable sound, influenced heavily by his new roles as husband and father. The album's intimate visuals - featuring Hailey and baby Jack Blues in moody black-and-white portraits - underscore a deeply personal tone. Hailey Bieber called out the 'f***ing losers' following Justin Bieber's album announcement https://www.youtube.com/embed/rh8pQn7J4yw?feature=oembed Related Justin Bieber's Coachella Body Language Shows He Feels 'Under Threat' With Hailey Bieber, Expert Says In 2025, speculation about  tension in Hailey and Justin Bieber's marriage intensified. Insiders reported that Hailey is frustrated by Justin's erratic behavior and perceived lack of motivation, especially as she balances life as Rhode's powerhouse founder and mother to their son, Jack Blues. She's allegedly grown weary of his public outbursts and social media dramas. Reports even suggest they've been spending time apart recently, struggling to find common ground amid financial worries. Hailey just proved all of the speculation wrong by commenting on Justin's new album, Swag. On July 10, 2025, she posted pictures to her  Instagram Stories showing the billboards promoting the album. She then added a picture of her and Justin posing. She's looking at the camera while Justin's looking down and facing toward her. 'Is it finally clocking to you f***ing losers?' Hailey captioned another one of her Stories, which included a picture of a Swag billboard with song names. Fans aren't impressed by Hailey Bieber's post Hailey Bieber likely hoped that Justin Bieber's album announcement would shut up the haters. Unfortunately, it didn't play out the way she thought it would. Several fans on  Reddit still think that Hailey is protecting her husband and marriage online despite Justin's public humiliation of her in the recent past. 'Interesting choice of words from someone whose husband publicly humiliates her like it's an Olympic sport,' one fan wrote. 'Does she think being married to Justin Bieber is a flex?' another fan asked. ' He treats you like s***, sweetie, I wouldn't wish that relationship upon my worst enemy.' 'Girl, read the room,' yet another fan commented. ' We aren't your enemy; it is your own husband that humiliates you.' For more news and exclusive interviews, follow Showbiz Cheat Sheet's Instagram.

More BCG fallout: Two top Boston Consulting Group executives will leave their leadership roles in the wake of revelations about the firm's work in Gaza. And harsh words from Jamie Dimon: The JPMorgan Chase chief executive warned European leaders they had a competitiveness problem and are “losing” the battle to rivals the US and China. In today's newsletter: Ackman tries pro tennis, loses Short seller goes long Revolut's $65bn valuationA master of the universe double faults It was a scene that could have come straight out of The Gilded Age, the popular TV adaptation of Edith Wharton's writing. Bill Ackman, the silver-haired Wall Street master of the universe, tested his mettle on Wednesday against two professional tennis players on a grass court in Newport, Rhode Island, the famed summer vacation spot at the turn of the 20th century. The 59-year-old financier best known for his tussles with corporate icons such as Procter & Gamble and epic multibillion-dollar windfalls and losses, snagged a wild card in a professional tournament held at tennis's global hall of fame. While a pro tennis court is new terrain for the billionaire, the conviction that got him there wasn't so out of the ordinary. Ackman has long been known in finance for his bags of confidence and willingness to duel with challengers in various arenas. In recent years he's prognosticated with varying degrees of success on Wall Street — and far beyond. He's fought Harvard and helped to oust its first African-American president. And he's threatened a legal war with Business Insider. A dozen years ago, Wall Street was gripped by his battle with fellow billionaires on a trade in Herbalife. The denouement included a 40-mile bike ride he was unable to complete due to lack of practice, and a $1bn loss. Tennis has always been one of Ackman's passions outside of the high-stakes investment world. He has backed professional players such as Francis Tiafoe, is regularly seen courtside at the US Open and has signalled his game is top notch. This week he was gifted a wild card slot in the International Tennis Hall of Fame Open, whose organiser he has backed financially, to play in a professional doubles match. Ackman's bravado was high. He said in a post on X he was “playing the best tennis of [his] life” and that he might be the oldest person to win professional points, if he won. So the scene was set for Ackman to prove his master of the universe stripes as Wharton herself might have written it. Could the gun-slinging investor and Harvard man prove himself on the tennis court? The answer on Wednesday was a resounding double-fault. The broadcast captured Ackman serving about half as fast as professionals and struggling to get his serve over the net. He and his playing partner lost in straight sets. A fascination with finance has increasingly seeped into popular culture in recent years with shows such as Billions, Succession and Industry. But under the unblinking glare of the cameras, many characters don't deliver relative to their mystique. Instead of renaissance men fluent in tennis and takeovers, they're delivering weekend quality serves. Andy Roddick, the 2003 US Open champion, called Ackman's display “the biggest joke I've watched in professional tennis”. Ackman, for his part, shared his reflections on X: “I can speak in front of an audience of a thousand people or in a TV studio on a broad range of topics without any preparation and without a twinge of fear, but yesterday I had my first real experience with stage fright.” Short seller Hunterbrook goes long A scoop-driven newsroom or a hedge fund with an edge? Wall Street is divided on what to think about Hunterbrook, the media start-up that supplies its scoops to an affiliated fund to trade on before it publishes them. If that wasn't enough to wrap your head around, Hunterbrook this week said that it planned to launch a litigation arm to partner with law firms on cases enabled by its reporting. It came as the start-up revealed to investors that it raised fresh funds at a $100mn valuation. The investor letter also came with some good news: the fund generated a 31 per cent return in the second quarter of 2025, and 16 per cent year to date. (Though even chief executive Nathaniel Brooks Horwitz admitted that shouldn't be seen as normal given the extreme market volatility.) The interesting thing is that the fund isn't quite working as originally envisaged. Early noises from the start-up suggested it would use its newsroom to reveal the scandals and malpractice lurking at the heart of Wall Street and then short the heck out of those stocks as the news hit the wires. Instead, Hunterbook has faced up to what it describes as an “irascible bull market” — and seems to have simply found out that a lot of companies are actually OK. The fund has ramped up its “long” bets, finding gems when its reporters were trying to dig up dirt, and turnaround stories rather than corporate failures. Good for the investors maybe, but journalists may feel puzzled. The old journalist maxim of “if it bleeds, it leads” — reflecting that breaking bad news stories is more profitable than pointing out the good — has not worked out quite as expected on Wall Street.Revolut's latest breathless valuation Revolut is in talks to raise new funding at a $65bn valuation to bankroll its American dream. The UK-based fintech plans to raise $1bn by issuing new shares and selling existing stock, the FT scooped. It hopes to use the money to finance its global expansion, with the US market a key target. The US investment firm Greenoaks is in talks to lead the funding round, and Abu Dhabi's Mubadala, which first invested in the company last year, is also in discussions to participate...."

mov_A62F7506FB86639751EA8A7702222885,2025-07-11 06:24:19,en,WEB,"  Justin Bieber has announced a new project— his seventh studio album, titled SWAG, which is scheduled to drop on Friday, July 11. Billboards announcing the Sorry singer's new album were spotted in LA as well as in Iceland, The Hollywood Reporter shared. Bieber has himself shared multiple pictures and videos of SWAG's billboards from different locations on his Instagram handle on Thursday. Some of these also had what is presumed to be the album's tracklist. Per the billboard, the soon-to-drop album will contain these 20 songs: Sources of The Hollywood Reporter claim that the new Justin Bieber album will be released by Def Jam. According to the media out, the Peaches singer finished the final touches of his album in late April 2025, for which he was headed to Iceland at the time. During his time there, Bieber hosted multiple jam sessions to ""vibe out"" with collaborators, an insider at the media outlet reports. These jam sessions were attended by artists like Tay James— his longtime DJ, HARV, Carter Lang, and Eddie Benjamin. The artists to feature on Justin Bieber's new album are Cash Cobain, Sexyy Red, and Gunna. In recent months, the Mistletoe singer has given them all shout-outs on his social media handles. Bieber's new album comes four years after his last album, Justice, was released. The singer's life has changed significantly since then. He parted ways with his longtime manager, Scooter Braun, in 2023, and welcomed his firstborn, Jack Blues Bieber, with his wife, Hailey, the following year, in August 2024. The announcement of Justin Bieber's seventh album comes in the wake of the singer posting a scenic photo with his wife, Hailey Bieber, on Instagram. In the picture, the couple appears to be sitting at the seaside, with Justin hugging the Rhode founder. Bieber captioned the post with multiple heart-eyed emojis. While the location of the picture wasn't revealed, it is believed to be in Spain. This is because Hailey has been sharing snippets of her Spanish vacation on her handle as well. As the announcement of Justin's new album dropped on social media, Hailey shared one of its cover arts, which is a family portrait of the three, on her Instagram story, writing over it: Per E! News, the message in Hailey's story references the viral video of Justin Bieber confronting paparazzi, which had gone viral last month. In the video, Bieber, who was visiting Malibu beach one evening, told a photographer: ""It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business."" Justin and Hailey Bieber coming together for the cover art of the singer's new album shuts down the rumor of their divorce, which first started when the supermodel was spotted in public without her engagement ring last month, on June 20, 2025."
mov_3A61D20AC48DD72D987F596B67A2DEFB,2025-07-11 07:02:52,en,WEB,"  CHICAGO: As an Afro-Latina woman with degrees in computer and electrical engineering, Maya De Los Santos hopes to buck a trend by forging a career in AI, a field dominated by white men. AI needs her, experts and observers say. Built-in viewpoints and bias, unintentionally imbued by its creators, can make the fast-growing digital tool risky as it is used to make significant decisions in areas such as hiring processes, health care, finance and law enforcement, they warn. ""I'm interested in a career in AI because I want to ensure that marginalised communities are protected from and informed on the dangers and risks of AI and also understand how they can benefit from it,"" said De Los Santos, a first-generation US college student. ""This unfairness and prejudice that exists in society is being replicated in the AI brought into very high stakes scenarios and environment, and it's being trusted, without more critical thinking."" Women represent 26% of the AI workforce, according to a UNESCO report, and men hold 80% of tenured faculty positions at university AI departments globally. Blacks and Hispanics also are underrepresented in the AI workforce, a 2022 census data analysis by Georgetown University showed. Among AI technical occupations, Hispanics held about 9% of jobs, compared with holding more than 18% of US jobs overall, it said. Black workers held about 8% of the technical AI jobs, compared with holding nearly 12% of US jobs overall, it said. AI bias De Los Santos will soon begin a PhD programme in human computer interaction at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. She said she wants to learn not only how to educate marginalised communities on AI technology but to understand privacy issues and AI bias, also called algorithm or machine learning bias, that produces results that reflect and perpetuate societal biases. Bias has unintentionally seeped into some AI systems as software engineers, for example, who are creating problem-solving techniques integrate their own perspectives and often-limited data sets. Amazon.com scrapped an AI recruiting tool when it found it was selecting resumes favouring men over women. The system had been trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most came from men, a reflection of a preponderance of men across the industry, and the system in effect taught itself that male candidates were preferable. ""When people from a broader range of life experiences, identities and backgrounds help shape AI, they're more likely to identify different needs, ask different questions and apply AI in new ways,"" said Tess Posner, founding CEO of AI4ALL, a non-profit working to develop an inclusive pipeline of AI professionals. ""Inclusion makes the solutions created by AI more relevant to more people,"" said Posner. Promoting diversity AI4ALL counts De Los Santos as one of the 7,500 students it has helped navigate the barriers to getting a job in AI since 2015. By targeting historically underrepresented groups, the non-profit aims to diversify the AI workforce. AI engineer jobs are one of the fastest growing positions globally and the fastest growing overall in the US and the United Kingdom, according to LinkedIn. Posner said promoting diversity means starting early in education by expanding access to computer science classes for children. About 60% of public high schools offer such classes with Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans less likely to have access. Ensuring that students from underrepresented groups know about AI as a potential career, creating internships and aligning them with mentors is critical, she said, Efforts to make AI more representative of American society are colliding with President Donald Trump's backlash against Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) programs in the federal government, higher education and corporate levels. DEI offices and programmes in the US government have been terminated and federal contractors banned from using affirmative action in hiring. Companies from Goldman Sachs to PepsiCo have halted or cut back diversity programmes. Safiya Noble, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles and founder of the Center on Resilience & Digital Justice, said she worries the government's attack on DEI will undermine efforts to create opportunities in AI for marginalised groups. ""One of the ways to repress any type of progress on civil rights is to make the allegation that tech and social media companies have been too available to the messages of civil rights and human rights,"" said Noble. ""You see the evidence with their backlash against movements like Black Lives Matter and allegations of anti-conservative bias,"" she said. Globally, from 2021 to 2024, UNESCO says the number of women working in AI increased by just 4 percent. While progress may be slow, Posner said she is optimistic. ""There's been a lot of commitment to these values of inclusion,” she said. ""I don't think that's changed, even if as a society, we are wrestling with what inclusion really means and how to do that across the board."" – Thomson Reuters Foundation"

1EB8AEEF1E1658D2D637ABBC1A04125B,2025-07-11 07:42:49,en,PRINT,"  At the Museum of Arts and Design at 2 Columbus Circle in New York in early June, Jonathan Adler, the potter and founder of the home furnishings company that bears his name, looked up at a blue and white ceramic apothecary jar he had designed in 2018. It had wavering stripes and the letters LSD on it. '' It's a nod to my love of Delft pottery and reimagined as if the potter was on an acid trip,'' Adler said, adding that he does not partake. Around him, an opening night party for the show he had assembled from the museum's extensive ceramics collection and his own work raged and raved. Adler, 58, moved among family, friends and vitrines spotlighting notable ceramic art works that had inspired him since he was a pottery-obsessed ''nerd'' growing up in New Jersey. He often took the train to the institution then known as the American Craft Museum and located on East 53rd Street. Many of the 300 or so objects on display -- divided into categories including animals, erotica, optimism, metallica and more -- offered a provocative lesson about humor and irreverence in the history of ceramics. In a section about Americana, Adler's grenade vases and rocket decanters (inspired by euphemisms for inebriated like ''bombed,'' ''blasted'' and ''tanked'') sat in dialogue with Howard Kotler's American Supperware from the late 60s. Kotler's plates depict flags and the White House in states of collapse. '' His work spanned so many different ideas and not only mixed materials but mixed art with commerce,'' Adler said. A section devoted to erotica took in Adler's porcelain breast-patterned vases and his suggestive banana versions, playing off Marvin Lipofsky's glass lips from 1967. In a section concentrating on animals, Adler admired a 1994 cast bronze ''Monkey Chair'' with primate faces and bodies as arms, and swirling tails as the back. '' Judy Kensley McKie finds ways to toy with animal forms in an idiosyncratic and fantastic style,'' he said of the Boston-based sculptural furniture maker who is now in her 80s. As he breezed past works from the museum's collection, he admired them like old friends. '' Ruth Duckworth's work removes the noise of decoration to expose pure form,'' he said of her white cups backed with square blades. The section inspired by the Funk Ceramics movement that came out of San Francisco in the late 1960s (it included Robert Arneson, Viola Frey, Peter Voulkos and others) consisted almost entirely of jokes and gags. Adler's needlepoints of ''Shrooms,'' his shoe-sized acrylic pills and a gilded ceramic lollipop holder vied for laughs with Arneson's earthenware ''Self-Portrait of the Artist Losing His Marbles'' (1965) and David Gilhooly's ''Bread Frog as a Coffee Break'' (1981), a kind of miniature glazed earthenware totem pole. ''Funk is one of my favorite genres because it was subversive and weird and crazy and silly,'' Adler had said earlier in a slide presentation about the show. '' One of the things funk people loved was making puns, and it kind of shows how on some level language can stimulate creativity and how there's a dialogue between language and objects.'' In fact, one of the first studios where he worked throwing pots, in Hell's Kitchen, was called Mud, Sweat & Tears. His stoneware ''Macho Macho Mugs'' made with faces of the Village People, is here for laughs, too, among walls that could almost be mistaken for a shop display, but with curatorial panels that analyze and comment. And yes, several Adler pieces are for sale in the museum shop -- nothing new in a post-Keith Haring world of crossed lines of art, design and commerce in museums. ''If Kehinde Wiley or Takashi Murakami has a show, they have merchandise for sale in the shops, and a show also promotes sales in their galleries,'' said Ezra Shales, a professor of craft and design history at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, who teaches Adler to his students as an example of virtuosity in the way he makes humor look beautiful. '' Jonathan's work has historic references but without the weight,'' Shales explained. But joking aside, Adler's affection for the often overlooked medium runs deep. ''He's extremely knowledgeable about the history of ceramics, and has a lot to say about inspiration and technique,'' said Elissa Auther, the chief curator of the Museum of Arts and Design. She acknowledged that showing the work of a living designer has a commercial crossover but explained that she wanted to bring someone in to interpret the museum's collection alongside her own curatorial observations. Adler, she pointed out, knew how he wanted to display everything, and gave explicit directions to Simon Doonan, his husband and the creative director behind the cheeky window displays of the former Barneys New York. One corner of the show is a recreation of Adler's studio, with inspirational objects on shelves and clippings and quotes on the walls. '' Make Pots Not War,'' one reads. Adler's company, which was acquired this year by Consortium Brand Partners with plans to expand beyond his 10 locations in the United States and London, has annual sales of $150 million. Not bad for a Brown University undergraduate who took pottery classes down the hill at the Rhode Island School of Design (known as RISD) in the late 1980s and made, among other things, a Chanel teapot. ''But when I applied for their M.F.A. program in ceramics, they rejected me,'' he said. By 1992 the Museum of Arts and Design (operating then as the American Craft Museum) was selling one of his first striped ceramic vases, and in 1998, he opened his first store in SoHo. His career from there spun out (pun intended) to include the interior design of the Parker Palm Springs Hotel, serving as a judge on Bravo's ''Top Design'' and creating a life-size dream house in Malibu for Barbie's 50th anniversary. But even with all that, his potter's soul remains. He put it simply: ''I'm a grown man who gets to play with mud all day.'' A couple of days after the opening, Adler was in his studio on West Broadway in SoHo, which is behind a window in the back of his kaleidoscopic store full of chandeliers, sofas, pillows, and myriad midcentury-inflected objects that he has referred to as his ''prescription for antidepressive living.'' Two of his associates were muddy from sculpting the Foo Dog vases that Adler, who still tries out new ideas as maquettes in clay, had imagined. On the shelves all kinds of past design ideas thrown on a wheel and often fired in the kiln on site -- ashtrays, vases, busts and more -- had accumulated like so many spurned lovers. '' So many things I make fail,'' Adler sighed. '' The truth is that every idea I have is ridiculous and to try to make anything when there are so many things on the planet already is preposterous, I know that, but to do what I do you have to have a bubbling sense of possibility.'' He looked over a set of ashtrays he named for decidedly unglamorous towns. ''They're going to bomb,'' he said. '' But I challenge myself to not be too rational.''

It's also using AI to predict the best warehouses to store items in order to reduce shipping mileage and times. On top of that, it has invested heavily in robots, that with advancements in AI are now able to take on increasingly complex tasks. Its robots aren't just moving boxes and lifting heavy items, some have a sense of touch and can grab items in tough-to-reach places and others can spot damaged items, helping the company save money on costly returns. At the same time, Amazon continues to be a cloud computing leader with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has created software tools that make it easy for developers to build and deploy AI models and tools, while the company has also developed its own proprietary chips for AI training and inference that give it a cost advantage over off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs). Put it all together, and Amazon is building one of the most powerful and defensible platforms on the planet. e.l.f. Beauty e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) Rhode brings with it higher price points and a strong skincare portfolio. That complements e.l.f.'s mass-market cosmetic lines and opens up cross-sell opportunities, as it's common in the beauty industry for consumers to use both prestige and mass products. Meanwhile, Hailey Bieber will stay on as chief creative officer, and e.l.f. will surely want to ramp up Rhode's product offerings. E.l.f. has already shown it knows how to gain share in a crowded market. It continues to expand internationally, and it should have opportunities in other adjacent markets down the road, like fragrance. With its brand-building track record and influencer marketing, e.l.f. has plenty of growth ahead. Dutch Bros One of the best themes to invest in in the consumer space is expansion, and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) The company just rolled out mobile ordering, which should boost throughput, and it is finally looking to roll out more food options, an area where it's been notably absent. Breakfast is a massive category, and Dutch Bros has acknowledged that not offering food items during this important daypart has likely cost it sales. If its food pilot proves successful, it could be a significant driver of same-store growth. Between new food offerings and expansion, this is a stock to own for the long haul. Cava Group Another great restaurant expansion story in progress right now is Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) The introduction of grilled steak to its menu last year was a game changer, and its menu continues to evolve and improve. Its added higher-margin items like fresh juices, and add-ons are already boosting average tickets. Cava is also experimenting with new dishes and a loyalty program to keep customers coming back. The big story, though, is still geographic expansion. With under 400 locations at the end of last quarter and a target of 1,000 by 2032, Cava's growth runway is wide open. Its ""coastal smile "" expansion strategy has worked well, and now it's starting to enter major Midwest markets like Chicago and Detroit. Cava has plenty of growth in front of it. Philip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) Zyn has become the breakout nicotine pouch brand in the U.S., with volumes up over 50% last quarter. The company acquired the brand when it bought Swedish Match in 2022, in what has to be one of the best deals in the consumer space over the past several years. Meanwhile, Iqos continues to take share overseas, especially in Europe and Japan, and is making inroads in newer markets like Mexico City and Jakarta. The company also bought back the U.S. rights to Iqos, giving it another potential growth driver in one of the world's biggest markets. At the same time, Philip Morris still runs a profitable legacy cigarette business overseas, where pricing remains strong and volumes are more stable. Importantly, the company typically uses local manufacturing, including with Zyn, meaning it faces little tariff risk. All in all, Philip Morris is a great growth stock in a defensive industry.

The tweet quickly went viral, creating confusion among the netizens. However, since Michael Jackson is no longer alive, and Denzel Washington is an actor and director, but not a music artist, neither of them is present on Bieber's SWAG. Moreover, @DailyNoud is a hip-hop parody news page, which indicates that its tweets are not to be trusted. The viral tweet bears a similarity to Complex Music's tweet regarding the same news. However, the latter has only mentioned Gunna, Sexyy Red, and Cash Cobain as featured guests on the new album. Other featured artists on the album (as per @Kurrco) are Druski, Dijon, Lil B, and Eddie Benjamin. In recent months, Bieber has also shouted out to these artists on his Instagram handle. Justin Bieber's SWAG, which comes four years after his last studio album, Justice, is set to release on Friday, July 11. While Justin Bieber's upcoming album might have been announced on Thursday, it has been in the works for a long time now. An exclusive The Hollywood Reporter article (published July 10) reported that Bieber traveled to Iceland three months ago - in late April - to add final touches to the new project. While in the Nordic region, Justin Bieber hosted ""jam sessions"" with other artists, doing the same upon returning to his LA home. The artists who showed up at the Mistletoe singer's place during these sessions were Carter Lang, DJ Tay James, HARV, and Eddie Benjamin. Some of the SWAG billboards also contain what appears to be the album's tracklist, containing these 20 titles: On other Billboards, Bieber's wife, Hailey Bieber, also appears, holding their 11-month-old son in her arms. The family portrait shuts down the rumors of the couple's divorce, which have been circulating since the Rhode founder was spotted without her engagement ring in NYC last month. Per Page Six, the supermodel had breakfast at West Village's The Commerce Inn on June 20, dressed in denim shorts, a tank top, a khaki trench coat, and sunglasses, with her ring missing. In addition to Hailey's story, Justin himself added a picture of the couple relaxing at the seaside in an Instagram post, captioning it with multiple heart eye emojis. Hailey Bieber also shared Justin's album cover art with their family portrait in her Instagram story, captioning it: ""Is it finally clocking to you f**king losers?"" Her caption referred to a viral video of Justin confronting a paparazzi at Malibu Beach, where he said, ""It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business."" The clip had raised concerns among fans about his mental health."

mov_7E962A6B5A17878DD7DEBCAF1526539C,2025-07-11 11:00:24,en,WEB,"  Facebook Tweet Email Link Link Copied! There's a new wave of interest in improving menopause care in the United States – it's in books, on podcasts and dominating social media hashtags – and it's even generating new legislation across more than a dozen states. From New York to California, lawmakers are weighing whether to support more menopause training for clinicians or mandate comprehensive insurance coverage for menopause treatment. Advocates of such legislation argue that these changes could improve access to care and reduce the risk that menopause symptoms will be dismissed by providers. At least two dozen bills have been introduced across 15 states this year, according to data from Jennifer Weiss-Wolf, executive director of the Birnbaum Women's Leadership Center at the New York University School of Law, and her colleagues who have been tracking menopause legislation. Most of the legislation is related to insurance coverage for menopause care, awareness and education, clinician training or menopause in the workplace. When it comes to menopause care, there continues to be a “lack of standardized treatment protocols” and “inadequate insurance coverage for evidence-based therapies like hormone replacement,” Dr. Mary Claire Haver, an ob/gyn at the Mary Claire Wellness Clinic in Galveston, Texas, and author of the book “The New Menopause,” said in an email. She hopes that some of the new legislation introduced this year – and future policies – may change that. Menopause is a natural phase of aging in which a woman has gone at least 12 consecutive months without a menstrual period due to a decline in her reproductive hormones. These hormonal changes can cause uncomfortable symptoms, including hot flashes, insomnia, vaginal and urinary problems, mood changes and weight gain, and can have long-term health implications. In the United States, an estimated 1.3 million women enter menopause each year, and most have symptoms. “For decades, menopause has been overlooked in both clinical research and health care policy, largely because it affects women in midlife — a group that has historically been underrepresented and undervalued in medicine,” said Haver, who collaborated with Weiss-Wolf on developing A Citizen's Guide to Menopause Advocacy. “Women in midlife are speaking out, demanding better care, and using their voices on platforms where they've historically been ignored,” she said. “We're also seeing more female physicians, researchers, and public figures normalize the conversation around menopause — which is finally translating into policy discussions and workplace changes.” As the 2025 legislative session has come to an end in most states, some more recently introduced menopause bills may be up for action next year. Most of the bills may not become laws, but that's not a loss, said Weiss-Wolf, author of the book “Periods Gone Public: Taking a Stand for Menstrual Equity.” “This only sets us up for what I hope will be a really impactful, successful state legislative session in 2026,” she said. “So, for me as an advocate, I'm not only marking success by bills passed, but just that the conversation has gotten to the point where state legislators are willing to step out on this issue.” 'The momentum is undeniable' Two bills introduced in March relate to raising awareness around menopause, according to Weiss-Wolf and her colleagues. One Illinois bill, passed in May, declares October 12-18 to be Menopause Awareness Week in the state. The other bill, introduced in Nevada, would have designated October as Menopause Awareness Month, but it was vetoed by the governor in June. Seven bills were introduced this year related to education, aiming to enable health care providers with more education about menopause treatment or requiring health departments to distribute educational resources for the public. One, in Maine, was signed by the governor and enacted last week. When it comes to enhancing menopause training for clinicians, California and New Jersey both introduced bills related to those themes this year. In California, legislation would require an assessment of physicians' education and training on menopause diagnosis and treatment. In New Jersey, the bill would permit up to three credits of continuing medical education on menopause to be used by providers to renew their licenses. Meanwhile, five bills have been introduced related to requiring insurance coverage for menopause care. One in New Jersey passed the Assembly, and one in Oregon is awaiting the governor's signature. “This is absolutely a national movement, and the momentum is undeniable. It's not just happening in California — Washington State, Oregon, Illinois, and Louisiana have all had bills either introduced or successfully passed in this space, with most of them looking to create similar insurance coverage mandates,” California Assemblymember Rebecca Bauer-Kahan said in an email. This year, Bauer-Kahan introduced Assembly Bill 432, which would mandate coverage for menopause evaluation and treatment options, among other orders. She said the bill was born out of her own experience of having perimenopausal symptoms and being dismissed when she asked her doctors for care. “I didn't know what was happening to me. So like many people would, I went to my internist. She said I was fine. But I knew I wasn't fine. I knew something was fundamentally wrong with my body. I went to my ob/gyn. Here I am, a woman in my mid-40s, telling my doctor that my brain isn't working properly, and once again, I was dismissed as 'fine,' ” Bauer-Kahan said in the email. “Women are over half the population, and yet our healthcare system fails to provide us with the care we need as we age,” she wrote. “This legislation closes the care gap, ensuring that menopause is treated as the central health need it is, not as an afterthought. We deserve comprehensive coverage and informed medical care, just like any other stage of life.” A Rhode Island bill related to menopause in the workplace was signed into law last week, making it the first state to enact workplace protections for menopausal women – and more could be coming. Legislation introduced this year in New York and New Jersey aims to address menopause in the workplace by preventing discrimination, extending workplace protections and requiring employers to allow remote work or paid leave for employees with symptoms. Then there are a few other bills, such as in Massachusetts and New York, related to a combination of menopause issues...."

These robots aren't just moving boxes, they are detecting damaged goods, navigating tight aisles, and even fixing themselves. Meanwhile, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model to coordinate the movement of its entire fleet of robots in order to save time and boost throughput. The company is also using AI to create better delivery routes and make it easier for drivers to find difficult drop-off locations within large apartment or office complexes. All of this is making Amazon more efficient and should lead to strong earnings growth in the years ahead. 2. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) However, the company's bigger opportunity lies in custom AI chips. Broadcom helped Alphabet design its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and now it has multiple customers developing their own custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These chips can offer better efficiency and performance than off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs), and Broadcom has become the primary partner for several top tech companies that are creating their own custom AI ASICs. Broadcom estimates that its three customers furthest along in their development could each deploy 1 million AI chip clusters by fiscal 2027, representing a $60 billion to $90 billion total serviceable addressable market. That's a big potential growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead. 3. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) At the same time, Meta's new AI tools are improving both ad creativity and targeting, leading to better ad performance. Last quarter, ad impressions rose 5% while average price per ad jumped 10%, demonstrating that its platform is becoming more effective for marketers. In addition, Meta has two new monetization opportunities emerging. The company just started serving ads on its popular messaging platform, WhatsApp, which boasts more than 3 billion users. At the same time, it's also begun to gradually serve ads to its new social media platform Threads, which had more than 350 million monthly users as of last quarter and is growing quickly. Between the better monetization of its core platforms and new opportunities with WhatsApp and Threads, Meta has a solid growth outlook over the next several years. 4. Philip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) Internationally, Iqos is gaining strong traction. The company sold more than 37 billion heated tobacco units last quarter, with strong growth in Japan and Europe. Philip Morris recently regained U.S. rights to Iqos and is piloting it in Austin, Texas. Once the FDA clears its latest device, a broader U.S. rollout could begin. Best of all, this would not cannibalize existing sales, since Philip Morris doesn't sell cigarettes in the U.S. What really sets these products apart, though, are their unit economics. Zyn is 6 times more profitable than traditional cigarettes, while Iqos is more than twice as profitable. In addition, Philip Morris tends to use local manufacturing, which shields it from any tariffs. With global cigarette sales still holding up outside the U.S., Philip Morris is a rare growth stock in a defensive industry. 5. E.l.f. Beauty E.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) Rhode was already set to expand into Sephora stores this year, and e.l.f. has strong relationships with retailers Ulta Beauty and Target. Increased distribution is one of the surest ways to increase growth, and e.l.f. will have a long runway of getting Rhode products onto retail shelfs. The deal also diversifies e.l.f. into prestige skincare and cosmetics, complementing its mass-market cosmetics base. That should boost margins and expand its reach to a slightly more affluent demographic. While the company will face tariff headwinds, the Rhode deal should help power strong growth in the years ahead. Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?..."

mov_0A38EB22C3DE505D9B09B554400678F4,2025-07-11 11:47:54,en,WEB,"  July 11th, 2025 ( The Motley Fool  - Delivered by  Newstex ) Key Points Amazon and Meta are using AI to help power growth. Broadcom looks poised to be a big winner in the continued AI infrastructure buildout. Philip Morris and e.l.f. Beauty have two of the best growth stories in the consumer space. There are a number of companies that are well positioned to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth over the next several years. Here are five monster stocks to buy right now and hold for the next five years or more. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocksto buy right now. Continue Image source: Getty Images. 1. Amazon While Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a leader in e-commerce and  cloud computing, what it is doing behind the scenes is the best reason to own the stock. At its cloud computing division, the company is helping customers customize, build, and deploy their own artificial intelligence (AI) models and tools through its Bedrock and SageMaker platforms and then run them on its infrastructure. But it goes beyond that, with Amazon having developed its own custom chips for AI training and inference, giving it a cost advantage. Another behind-the-scenes area where Amazon is a market leader is robotics. The company is the world's largest operator of mobile robots, having just deployed its millionth robot, which is working at one of its fulfillment centers. These robots aren't just moving boxes, they are detecting damaged goods, navigating tight aisles, and even fixing themselves. Meanwhile, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model to coordinate the movement of its entire fleet of robots in order to save time and boost throughput. The company is also using AI to create better delivery routes and make it easier for drivers to find difficult drop-off locations within large apartment or office complexes. All of this is making Amazon more efficient and should lead to strong earnings growth in the years ahead. 2. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is one of the winners of the AI infrastructure buildout. Its portfolio of networking components -- which consists of Ethernet switches, digital signal processing, network interface cards,and optical receivers -- is needed for moving data across massive AI clusters. Last quarter, the company saw a 70% jump in AI networking revenue. However, the company's bigger opportunity lies in custom AI chips. Broadcom helped Alphabet design its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and now it has multiple customers developing their own custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These chips can offer better efficiency and performance than off-the-shelf  graphics processing units (GPUs), and Broadcom has become the primary partner for several top tech companies that are creating their own custom AI ASICs. Broadcom estimates that its three customers furthest along in their development could each deploy 1 million AI chip clusters by fiscal 2027, representing a $60 billion to $90 billion total serviceable addressable market. That's a big potential growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead. 3. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) owns one of the largest digital advertising platforms in the world, and AI is making it even more powerful. The company is using its Llama AI model to drive higher engagement across Facebook and Instagram by displaying more relevant content, increasing personalization, and adding interactive features. Meanwhile, the more time users spend on its platform, the more ad inventory it has to sell. At the same time, Meta's new AI tools are improving both ad creativity and targeting, leading to better ad performance. Last quarter, ad impressions rose 5% while average price per ad jumped 10%, demonstrating that its platform is becoming more effective for marketers. In addition, Meta has two new monetization opportunities emerging. The company just started serving ads on its popular messaging platform, WhatsApp, which boasts more than 3 billion users. At the same time, it's also begun to gradually serve ads to its new social media platform Threads, which had more than 350 million monthly users as of last quarter and is growing quickly. Between the better monetization of its core platforms and new opportunities with WhatsApp and Threads, Meta has a solid growth outlook over the next several years. 4. Philip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) has become one of the best growth stories in the consumer staples space. While most tobacco companies are facing volume declines due to their U.S. exposure, Philip Morris is thriving thanks to Zyn and Iqos. Zyn nicotine pouches are exploding in popularity in the U.S., with shipments up 53% last quarter. Philip Morris raised its full-year guidance to 800 million to 840 million cans, and that still might be conservative. Internationally, Iqos is gaining strong traction. The company sold more than 37 billion heated tobacco units last quarter, with strong growth in Japan and Europe...."
n2j8b80,2025-07-11 11:53:48,en,REDDIT,"  I love this book, so that's why I keep recommending it to every human, cat, dog, and bird I know: *The Devil and the Blacksmith: A New England Folktale* by Jéanpaul Ferro It's about a shadow person who visits a POW in Andersonville Prison Camp and offers him a way home back to his village in Rhode Island, but the two wind up in a wild odyssey of supernatural trickery, savage brutality, and a life and death battle that is very weird and haunting. Set in the same town in Rhode Island, Scituate, that H.P. Lovecraft set the ""blasted heath"" in The Colour of Outer Space,"" it details how the town of Scituate that once had 14 villages ended up under water by supernatural forces. It isn't like other horror novels in the genre. I think it takes more chances, is more literary, and the epilogue ending, which is a photographic scrap book is pretty damn haunting and unlike any book, of any kind, I've ever read. And it changes everything you just read before it into a new horrifying light. It is one of the many great aspects of the book!"

mov_3C6968FC1D7FB852E1856FA5E8B882A1,2025-07-11 12:29:33,en,WEB,"  Elon Musk is now threatening to target the country's two-party political system by creating the “America Party,” but even the world's richest man could run into roadblocks in trying to establish an alternative to the Democrats and Republicans. One person who knows a thing or two about starting his own political party on the local level is businessman Ken Block, who formed the Moderate Party of Rhode Island in the late aughts. Block won 6.5 percent of the vote as the Moderate candidate for governor in 2010, and Robert Healey had a sizable impact on the 2014 race when he earned 21.4 percent. But things quickly fell apart, and the party is essentially defunct now. I asked Block to tell us more about what it was like to create a party, and to offer some advice to Musk. Megan Hall Q: You're not Elon Musk for a lot of reasons, but you created the Moderate Party in Rhode Island for a lot of the same reasons Musk says he thinks there should be a third national party. Was there a specific incident that made you start it? Block: If I was Elon, my response to your questions would be , and I would have bought an island in Narragansett Bay and renamed it Block's Island! When I woke up politically in 2007, Rhode Island was a more expensive place for me to live and run my businesses than Massachusetts, otherwise known as Taxachusetts. I wrote an opinion piece about this in The Providence Journal, which prompted many people to reach out to me in agreement and support. I hated the political polarization and dysfunction (now I look back at those times as the good old days), and thought that a centrist party would be the answer to those problems, a party dedicated to quality of life issues that stayed away from social issues. Elon Musk has the benefit of being one of the world's richest men, but it would take strong organization on the ground in every state to make a third party a reality. Can you take us behind the scenes on how difficult it is to simply create the party, let alone become viable? Creating a viable third party at the national level is extremely difficult. There are legal roadblocks to clear in each state, where many laws enacted by Democrats and Republicans make it difficult for a new party to establish itself. A couple of billion dollars would go a long way toward clearing the legal and administrative hurdles necessary to launch the party, such as overturning unfair and unconstitutional ballot access laws and collecting millions of signatures. A chicken/egg problem arises as soon as the party is born: you need quality candidates to build momentum, but those same candidates want some assurances that the party is stable and not being overrun with folks with positions contrary to those of the candidates. Ultimately, you stepped away from your party and ran for governor a second time as a Republican. What didn't work about the Moderates? Too many Americans don't get third parties. As challenging as it is today to define what it means to be a Democrat or a Republican, it is much harder to define a new party and keep everyone on message. We did not recruit nearly enough candidates, let alone good ones. We ended up with political novices, most of whom did not undertake the necessary work to win local races in Rhode Island. Experienced politicians did not want to handicap their election efforts by running under the banner of a fledgling party. It turns out that launching the party was the easy part. I ended up running for governor as the new party's candidate in 2010 because no one else would, and we needed our candidate to win 5 percent of the vote to keep the party alive. I got 6.5 percent. What advice would you give to Elon Musk? It is unclear whether Musk intends to build a lasting political party. He has said things that lead me to believe that his party is more about unelecting key Republicans in 2026. If that is his goal, any advice about building a viable party is wasted. If he wants to create a new party that survives and thrives, he will need to buy the infrastructure in each state to make it happen; quality, full-time party chairs and other positions whose jobs would be dedicated to the success of the party, with enough seed money to see the party through the first election. If you were creating a new party now, would you try to make a connection with Musk? I am sure that Musk is being inundated with requests for his attention and money by those who want to create an alternative to the Democrats and Republicans. We desperately need a better choice, as the two major parties move further towards their extremes and spend far more time attacking each other rather than working for the common good. Musk's messaging before his fallout with Trump was in no way centrist, which makes it hard for me to see how he can credibly claim to represent those in the middle. Let's see how things play out over the next few months. If Musk's political aspirations are to create a viable centrist party, I would indeed be interested.

More innovation — Rhode Island government at every level functionally looks exactly like it did 30 to 40 years ago, but nothing else in the world does. 2. Parents should demand excellence in the schools in their communities. To support this, the legislature should immediately pass the Education Bill of Rights, a protection that is long past due. 3. Bob Whitcomb pointed out a ridiculous regulation that fails to serve the public or small businesses. It is time to name a smart group of non-bureaucrats who are not self-dealing to look at Rhode Island's regulatory structure. We cannot afford or sustain the old models. 4. Consolidate school districts, police and fire departments, and other functions such as snow plowing. No layoffs are necessary, and it can be accomplished by restructuring over time. If staffing reductions make sense — do them through attrition. 5. Technology for all communities. Instead of a hodgepodge of bad city and town websites, build one top-tier platform and provide it to each of the cities and towns at no cost. Most Rhode Island governmental websites are a disaster. 6. Fire underperformers — See Peter Alviti. 7. Better integration between urban police departments and the Rhode Island State Police. When hot spots emerge — Kennedy Plaza, Federal Hill, Providence Place Mall — the State Police should be part of the solution. 8. All public meetings - city and state - should be broadcast and posted to YouTube. Oregon does it. 9. More parks — Metacomet Golf Course in East Providence should have been taken by eminent domain and made into a great urban park. More public spaces for families to play, celebrate and recreate. 10. The court system should adopt a functional infrastructure for tracking public information and providing access to the public — Minnesota's website is a perfect example. The existing site is another state embarrassment. 11. Stop funding loser projects. Rhode Island taxpayers were put on the hook by Governor Dan McKee and the board of the Commerce Corporation for $141 million for the minor league soccer stadium in Pawtucket. There was no voter approval, and the state has no ownership interest in a private development project. If the project was viable, then the team would have built the stadium on their own dime. 12. Play-up strengths — design is a winner for Rhode Island. Manufacturing has been and could rebound if tariffs hit. 13. Demand more from schools, elected officials, etc. This does not mean being abusive, but it does mean expecting accountability. 14. Support innovators — give Chris Marsella's Track 15 a try when it opens this spring. It is a bold idea that is NOT publicly funded and, if it works, will be a major addition to the city and state. Newport Jazz and Folk Festivals are globally known. Coming in March is a new culinary festival and a top-tier comedy convention. 15. Enjoy the growth and expanded travel opportunities due to the transformation of Rhode Island International Airport — it is hard to believe you can now fly non-stop to Bermuda, Puerto Rico, and LA from PVD...."

Ford is recalling over 850,000 vehicles due to a potential low-pressure fuel pump failure, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). The recall includes various makes and models from 2021 to 2023. ""A repair is still being developed,"" according to the Consumer Reports website. ""Ford plans to send notification letters to owners in mid-July 2025. Follow-up letters will be sent once the remedy is available, with guidance on how to have the recall work performed."" Here's more about the issue. Consumer Reports stated that if the fuel pump fails it ""could cause engine stalling while driving, risking a crash and injury."" The report continues, ""Loss of fuel pressure and flow from the low-pressure fuel pump can be due to internal contamination of the jet pump, specifically in low fuel conditions, and reduced fuel-pump internal clearances that result in increased internal friction."" Some signs your fuel pump might be failing include ""difficulty starting, engine sputtering or stalling, loss of power, and unusual noises coming from the fuel tank,"" according to the Automotive Skills Development Council website, ""You might also notice decreased fuel efficiency or a check engine light."" They include: In total, there are 850,318 vehicles potentially affected by this issue, according to a report in USA Today.

mov_1F457AB9B03239176B3911E1CA382B47,2025-07-11 14:49:42,en,WEB,"  The number of measles cases in the U.S. has hit its highest level in 33 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As of July 8, there have been at least 1,288 confirmed cases this year. That's more than quadruple the 285 U.S. cases in all of 2024. There have been a total of 27 outbreaks reported this year, which the CDC defines as three or more related cases. Of the 1,288 cases, 1,130 of them are outbreak-associated. A worsening measles outbreak that started in under-vaccinated areas of West Texas has infected at least 753 people since late January, according to Texas health officials. Two school-age children in the state's outbreak area have died. They were both unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions. At least 98 of those patients have been hospitalized over the course of the outbreak. Texas health officials believe the measles outbreak could last for a year. The outbreak has escalated to neighboring counties and states, including New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. New Mexico reported 95 cases across eight counties as of Friday, the state's health department said. In early March, the agency reported that a deceased resident tested positive for measles, but the official cause of death hasn't been confirmed. Other recent cases have been reported in Kansas, now up to 87, and Oklahoma, which has confirmed 17. The CDC said that as of July 8, measles cases have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of making anti-vaccine statements, fired all 17 members of the federal vaccine advisory panel last month. He replaced them with several people who have also expressed anti-vaccine views. Yahoo News answers some of the most frequently asked questions about the virus. What should I know about measles? Measles, also known as rubeola, is one of the most contagious diseases in the world, whose symptoms include fever and rash. It can lead to serious health complications, especially in children under 5 who aren't vaccinated. How it spreads: Through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes or talks. It's so contagious that nine out of 10 people exposed to the virus will get infected if they have not been vaccinated, according to the CDC. Airborne droplets of the virus can remain in a room for two hours, even after the person with measles has left the room, according to Cleveland Clinic. Droplets of the measles virus can also land on surfaces and spread to other people that way. More in Health Measles can also be spread by: Sharing food or drinks or kissing someone who has measles Shaking or holding hands or hugging someone with measles If someone touches a surface containing the virus and then touches their mouth, nose or eyes Pregnant women with measles can transmit it to their babies either during pregnancy or while nursing Signs and symptoms: Measles symptoms can appear seven to 14 days after a person has contact with the virus. Common symptoms of measles include: High fever Runny nose Red or bloodshot eyes About three days after these first symptoms start, tiny white spots might appear inside the mouth. Three to five days after the initial symptoms begin, an infected person will develop a red, blotchy rash that often starts from the head and moves down the body. The rash can last about seven to 10 days, according to Cleveland Clinic. People infected with measles can spread the virus to other people four days before the rash appears until four days after it goes away, the National Institute of Health says. No treatment: There's currently no treatment for measles and the virus has to run its course, which generally takes 10 to 14 days. Overall, health agencies say the best treatment for measles is prevention through the measles vaccine. What's driving the latest measles outbreak? Measles was declared eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, a feat achieved through vaccinations. Measles can be carried into the U.S. by unvaccinated travelers, including Americans, as well as foreign travelers who bring it back to the U.S. Measles can spread among unvaccinated individuals and can lead to outbreaks. The outbreak in West Texas is spreading mainly through a Mennonite community. ""Measles is a great exploiter of unvaccinated individuals,"" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told Yahoo News. ""If you have a significant population that has not been vaccinated, then measles can rip through those populations very quickly because it's one of the most highly transmissible virus agents we know."" Measles ""has a reproductive number of between 12 and 18,"" Hotez said. ""It means a single individual can, on average, infect another 12 to 18 unvaccinated individuals.""..."

mov_0095A4DC5FE836D5E73FB19A9FA376DB,2025-07-11 15:09:56,en,WEB,"  The number of measles cases in 2025 has reached its highest level in decades, the CDC said. The number of measles cases in the United States has hit its highest level in 33 years, according to the . As of July 8, there have been at least 1,288 confirmed cases this year. That's more than quadruple the 285 U.S. cases in all of 2024. There have been a total of 27 outbreaks reported this year, which the CDC defines as three or more related cases. Of the 1,288 cases, 1,130 of them are outbreak-associated. A worsening measles outbreak that started in under-vaccinated areas of West Texas has infected at least 753 people since late January, according to . Two school-age children in the state's outbreak area have died. They were both unvaccinated and had no known underlying conditions. At least 98 of those patients have been hospitalized over the course of the outbreak. Texas health officials believe the measles outbreak could last for a year. The outbreak has escalated to neighboring counties and states, including New Mexico, Oklahoma and Kansas. 95 cases across eight counties as of Friday, the state's health department said. In early March, the that a deceased resident tested positive for measles, but the official cause of death hasn't been confirmed. Other recent cases have been reported in Kansas, , and Oklahoma, The said that as of July 8, measles cases have been reported in Alaska, Arkansas, Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York City, New York State, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia, Washington and Wyoming. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who has a history of making anti-vaccine statements, fired all 17 members of the federal vaccine advisory panel . He replaced them with several people who have also expressed anti-vaccine views. Yahoo News answers some of the most frequently asked questions about the virus. What should I know about measles? Measles, also known as rubeola, is one of the most contagious diseases in the world, whose symptoms include fever and rash. It can lead to serious health complications, especially in children under 5 who aren't vaccinated. How it spreads: Through the air when an infected person breathes, coughs, sneezes or talks. It's so contagious that nine out of 10 people exposed to the virus will get infected if they have not been vaccinated,. Airborne droplets of the virus can remain in a room for two hours, even after the person with measles has left the room, according to. Droplets of the measles virus can also land on surfaces and spread to other people that way. Measles can also be spread by: Signs and symptoms: Measles symptoms can appear seven to 14 days after a person has contact with the virus. Common symptoms of measles include: About three days after these first symptoms start, tiny white spots might appear inside the mouth. Three to five days after the initial symptoms begin, an infected person will develop a red, blotchy rash that often starts from the head and moves down the body. The rash can last about seven to 10 days, according to. People infected with measles can spread the virus to other people four days before the rash appears until four days after it goes away, the says. No treatment: There's for measles and the virus has to run its course, which generally takes 10 to 14 days. Overall, health agencies say the best treatment for measles is prevention through the measles vaccine. What's driving the latest measles outbreak? Measles was declared eradicated in the U.S. in 2000, a feat achieved through vaccinations. Measles can be carried into the U.S. by unvaccinated travelers, including Americans, as well as foreign travelers who bring it back to the U.S. Measles can spread among unvaccinated individuals and can lead to outbreaks. The outbreak in West Texas is spreading mainly through a Mennonite community. ""Measles is a great exploiter of unvaccinated individuals,"" Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine and co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development, told Yahoo News. ""If you have a significant population that has not been vaccinated, then measles can rip through those populations very quickly because it's one of the most highly transmissible virus agents we know."" Measles ""has a reproductive number of between 12 and 18,"" Hotez said. ""It means a single individual can, on average, infect another 12 to 18 unvaccinated individuals."" I'm an adult who was vaccinated as a child. Do I need a booster? There are two types of vaccines that protect against measles, given in the form of a shot: “MMR & MMRV vaccines usually protect people for life against measles and rubella; but immunity against mumps may decrease over time,” according to the . However, the a certain type of inactive measles vaccine made available between 1963 and 1967 ""was not effective,"" which is why they advise certain adults to get a booster. ""People who were vaccinated prior to 1968 with either inactivated (killed) measles vaccine or measles vaccine of unknown type should be revaccinated with at least one dose of live attenuated measles vaccine,"" the on its website. What other groups of people should be vaccinated who don't have immunity?..."
mov_0A6A0AC349BC830F26BB06CFE70E2948,2025-07-11 15:10:19,en,WEB,"  As an Afro-Latina woman with degrees in computer and electrical engineering, Maya De Los Santos hopes to buck a trend by forging a career in artificial intelligence (AI), a field dominated by white men. AI needs her, say experts and observers. Built-in viewpoints and bias, unintentionally imbued by its creators, can make the fast-growing digital tool risky as it is used to make significant decisions in areas such as hiring processes, healthcare, finance and law enforcement, they warn. ""I'm interested in a career in AI because I want to ensure that marginalised communities are protected from and informed on the dangers and risks of AI and also understand how they can benefit from it,"" said De Los Santos, a first-generation United States college student. ""This unfairness and prejudice that exists in society is being replicated in the AI brought into very high stakes scenarios and environment, and it's being trusted, without more critical thinking."" Women represent 26 per cent of the AI workforce, according to a Unesco report, and men hold 80 per cent of tenured faculty positions at university AI departments globally. Blacks and Hispanics also are underrepresented in the AI workforce, a 2022 census data analysis by Georgetown University showed. Among AI technical occupations, Hispanics held about nine per cent of jobs, compared with holding more than 18 per cent of US jobs overall, it said. Black workers held about eight per cent of the technical AI jobs, compared with holding nearly 12 per cent of US jobs overall, it said. De Los Santos will soon begin a PhD programme in human computer interaction at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. She wants to learn not only how to educate marginalised communities on AI technology but to understand privacy issues and AI bias, also called algorithm or machine learning bias, that produces results that reflect and perpetuate societal biases. Bias has unintentionally seeped into some AI systems as software engineers, for example, who are creating problem-solving techniques integrate their own perspectives and often-limited data sets. Amazon.com scrapped an AI recruiting tool when it found it was selecting resumes favouring men over women. The system had been trained to vet applicants by observing patterns in resumes submitted to the company over a 10-year period. Most came from men, a reflection of a preponderance of men across the industry, and the system in effect taught itself that male candidates were preferable. ""When people from a broader range of life experiences, identities and backgrounds help shape AI, they're more likely to identify different needs, ask different questions and apply AI in new ways,"" said Tess Posner, founding chief executive officer of AI4ALL, a non-profit working to develop an inclusive pipeline of AI professionals. ""Inclusion makes the solutions created by AI more relevant to more people,"" said Posner. AI4ALL counts De Los Santos as one of the 7,500 students it has helped navigate the barriers to getting a job in AI since 2015. By targeting historically underrepresented groups, the non-profit aims to diversify the AI workforce. AI engineer jobs are one of the fastest growing positions globally and the fastest growing overall in the US and the United Kingdom, according to LinkedIn. Posner said promoting diversity means starting early in education by expanding access to computer science classes for children. About 60 per cent of public high schools offer such classes with Blacks, Hispanics and Native Americans less likely to have access. Ensuring that students from underrepresented groups know about AI as a potential career, creating internships and aligning them with mentors is critical, she said. Efforts to make AI more representative of American society are colliding with President Donald Trump's backlash against Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) programmes. DEI offices and programmes in the US government have been terminated and federal contractors banned from using affirmative action in hiring. Safiya Noble, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles and founder of the Centre on Resilience & Digital Justice, said she worries the government's attack on DEI will undermine efforts to create opportunities in AI for marginalised groups. ""One of the ways to repress any type of progress on civil rights is to make the allegation that tech and social media companies have been too available to the messages of civil rights and human rights,"" said Noble. * The writer is from Reuters"

mov_30943625CCF322A86DCC0785BC1F1E54,2025-07-11 15:22:57,en,WEB,"  By MARIA SHERMAN, AP Music Writer Published: July 11, 2025, 8:22am Share NEW YORK (AP) — Never say never! Justin Bieber surprised fans Friday by releasing “Swag,” his seventh studio album, hours after he teased it on billboards and social media posts. It is his first album since 2021's “Justice” and his first since becoming a father last year. “Inspired by his devotion as a husband and father, this new era of music has fueled a deeper perspective and more reflective sound, resulting in some of his most personal music yet,” Def Jam Recordings said of the 21-track album. Billboards depicting Bieber were found by fans Thursday in Reykjavik, Iceland, and Los Angeles. The singer also shared images of billboards on his official Instagram account along with a tracklist that included song names like “All I Can Take,” “Walking Away,” “Dadz Love” and “Forgiveness.” Recommendations for an intimate new album There's a lot to love across the 21-tracks of the intimate “Swag.” Here are a few choice cuts. 1. “Daises” — The second track on the album may very well be its strongest; an exemplar in Bieber's slow-burn brand of alternative R&B-pop, now anchored with lo-fi guitar. Here, his sweet voice is pronounced — exactly what his most dedicated fans want to hear. 2. “Devotion” ft. Dijon — Dijon is a rising R&B voice; some fans might be familiar with his 2021 debut album “Absolutely” or his contribution to Bon Iver's”SABLE, fABLE” from earlier this year. He makes for a standout collaboration on “Swag,” a sweet song about deepening affection. 3. “Go Baby” – Bieber married the model Hailey Bieber (nee Baldwin) in 2018; she's long been source material for his most loving tracks. “Go Baby” is a standout for that reason. “That's my baby, she's iconic,” he opens the track, “iPhone case, lip gloss on it,” referencing her Rhode skincare and beauty brand, which sold to Elf Beauty in a $1 billion deal. 4. “Walking Away” – Marriage isn't easy; that's clear on “Walking Away,” a slightly-more-uptempo track where Bieber makes his dedication evident. It's the perfect song for dancing in the kitchen with your partner. 5. “All I Can Take” – The throwback opener “All I Can Take” has a vintage groove — echoes of Beiber's early work, now matured to reflect his current adult reality. He sounds as sweet as ever in the pre-chorus, his declaration of “Ooh, baby, don't it feel good? Baby, don't it feel nice? / Ooh, baby, don't it feel good? You don't have to think twice.” Bieber before “Swag” Bieber, the two-time Grammy Award winning singer and Canadian pop idol who revolutionized teen pop and social media fame, is best known for his silky R&B pop lyric tenor, demonstrated on the diamond-selling “Baby,” “Sorry,” and “Stay” with the Kid Laroi. At the beginning of his career, and as a tween, Bieber began working with Usher and the influential music manager Scooter Braun. In 2023, Bieber sold the rights to his music — all six of his albums, including hits like “Sorry” and “Baby” — to Hipgnosis, a U.K-based music investment company. The deal's financial details were not disclosed, but Billboard Magazine reports that the sale was worth an estimated $200 million. In August 2024, Justin and Hailey Bieber announced the birth of their first child, Jack Blues Bieber."

mov_22A4B27EE296DB5F595DCAD2882AB951,2025-07-11 15:26:29,en,WEB,"  While a white shirt with a black bikini will always be a timeless beach combination, this year there has been a return to extravagant – possibly bordering on obnoxious? – resortwear. Instead of dressing as though they holiday like you and me, celebrities are embracing an opulent Euro aesthetic that cackles in the face of quiet luxury and puts the fun back into the vacation wardrobe. It was April when declared that the Pucci Woman would define the 2025 vibe: fast forward to this week, and Hailey Bieber was dressed like a human shot of limoncello in Port d'Andratx, wearing a zesty custom capri-pant-and-string-bikini set by the Italian brand, and a pair of kitten heels for good measure. If the quiet luxury movement was all about an Olsen twin-inspired, anti-paparazzi approach to dressing, this is the total opposite: think, leaning into look-at-me style tropes. Having a dedicated resortwear wardrobe is in itself an extravagance (a sign that you spend a chunk of the year out of office without a second thought for your annual leave allowance). Swirl print palazzos, tunics and pool-ready co-ords aren't ever going to translate into your everyday wardrobe. Unless, that is, you actually live in Portofino. Celebrities have levelled up their swimwear game specifically this year, via custom resortwear creations – like Hailey Bieber's Pucci set – and rare archive looks. Kylie Jenner, for example, has worn a rhinestone-encrusted Chanel bikini from the spring/summer 1995 collection a polka-dot set from Ralph Lauren's spring/summer 2000 collection. There's nothing frugal about this particular second-hand swimwear: both sets are considered collector's items. You can embrace Amalfi styling without blowing four figures on a bikini, however. Simply seek out bold colours, printed scarves and sarongs (if you can stretch to Pucci, then do so), and embellished swimwear. One note of caution: this look really requires a Med backdrop – your local lido won't cut it. Extra embellishment: For her recent holiday to Mallorca, Dua Lipa amped up the glamour in a sequin-encrusted kaftan and a cheery-embellished bikini from the recent Frankies Bikinis X Réalisation Par collaboration. She also boarded a yacht in a teeny-tiny leopard-print bikini with a gold Chanel quilted bag – the Euro vacay girl doesn't mess around with practical things like raffia. Frankies Bikinis X Réalisation Par Nick Triangle Bikini Top Frankies Bikinis X Réalisation Par Mackenzie Bikini Bottom Double or triple polka dots: In Italy, Kylie Jenner wore a polka-dot bikini and matching capri pants from Ralph Lauren's spring/summer 2000 collection. The Kardashian-Jenners have never really messed with shy-and-retiring minimalism, and she's been summering this year in leopard print, studded and spotty swimwear. It's all very vintage Dolce (sorry, Kourtney). Sir Devin Polka-Dot Bikini Top Dolce & Gabbana Cotton Pants With Polka-Dot Print Football fever: Model Paloma Elsesser took to the beach in Barcelona toting an oversized Balenciaga City bag (a fashion-girl pool bag) and wearing a vintage football print co-ord. She proves that summer can be a time for loud prints and a more literal take on Euros dressing (after all, it is the summer of women's football). Conner Ives Printed Shirred Jersey Top Conner Ives Appliquéd Lace-Trimmed Striped Shorts Pucci prints: For a Rhode party in Mallorca to celebrate the launch of her lemon-scented lip balm, Hailey dressed on-theme in a “lemontini” look that matched her cocktail. Her stylist Dani Michelle worked on this custom Pucci capri and bikini set, which features a zesty twist on the brand's iconic Iride print. For a boat trip, she then added a polka dot scarf to her hair to make the whole thing even more Euro summer. Pucci Iride Printed Swimsuit Pucci Iride Printed Silk Miniskirt La Dolce Vita scarves: Alexa Chung embraced the retro vibe of Positano in her bright red high-waisted shorts, which she styled with a clashing purple top and a printed scarf looped over her hair. It's nostalgic Italian glamour at its very best, and let's be honest, beats a plain black bikini any day. Pucci Marmo Silk Twill Scarf Cou Cou Intimates..."

The album comes nearly four years after his last, 2021's Justice, and features a starry multitude of collaborators, including Dijon, Gunna, Sexyy Red, Lil B, and Druski. Bieber worked on new music after hosting various “jam sessions” at his Los Angeles home and later completed the album during a trip to Iceland with friends and collaborators earlier this year, according to the Hollywood Reporter Ahead, we break down everything to know about Swag. Justin revealed the album drop in a series of billboards. The day before the album's release date, Bieber posted photos and videos of billboards emblazoned with Swag's cover art and track list across the world, in locales like New York City, Iceland, Los Angeles, and Atlanta. He included photos of his family in the album art. While Swag's cover art simply shows a black background with the title in a faded serif font, the accompanying album art includes intimate scenes with Bieber's wife, Rhode founder Hailey Bieber, and their baby son, Jack Blues. Bieber shared photos from the shoot on his Instagram Story on Thursday. The project includes 21 songs. See the full track list below. Swag features multiple collaborators. The album includes features from Cash Cobain, Dijon, Druski, Eddie Benjamin, Gunna, Marvin Winans, and Sexxy Red (Cobain, Dijon, and Benjamin also helped produce the album). Regarding production, Bieber worked with Daniel Caesar, Carter Lang, Daniel Chetrit, Eli Teplin, Harv, Knox Fortune, Sir Dylan. More music might be on the way. While Swag embraces Bieber's R&B roots, a more pop-focused album may be on its way soon. Sources at Billboard"

Justin Bieber is putting his love on the line. In his long-awaited seventh studio album, ""Swag,"" the pop star appeared to address long-rumored marital troubles with wife Hailey Bieber in several tracks. In his song ""Walking Away,"" the 31-year-old singer sang, ""Tell me why you're throwing stones at my back -- You know I'm defenseless."" JUSTIN BIEBER MAKES PUBLIC APOLOGY TO HAILEY OVER VOGUE COVER COMMENTS ""Girl, we better stop before we say some s--t. We've been testing our patience. I think we better off if we just take a break and remember what grace is,"" Bieber added. In his next set of lyrics he sang, ""Baby, I ain't walking away. You were my diamond. Gave you a ring. I made you a promise. I told you, I'd change. It's just human nature, these growing pains. And baby, I ain't walking away."" On Bieber's track ""Daisies,"" he appeared to paint a picture of emotional uncertainty as he questioned the strength of his relationship. JUSTIN BIEBER FEARS BEING 'EXPOSED,' SAYS HE'S BEEN 'USED' AS CONCERNS MOUNT FOR TROUBLED POP STAR He compared himself to someone picking petals, as he sang: ""Do you love me or not?"" ""Head is spinnin', and it don't know when to stop. You said 'Forever,' babe, did you mean it or not?"" Bieber continued. ""And if it ain't right, babe, you know, I respect it. But if you need time, just take your time. Honey, I get it, I get it, I get it."" View this post on Instagram A post shared by Justin Bieber (@lilbieber) In his track ""Go Baby,"" one of the album's softer moments, Bieber appeared to shift from turmoil to tenderness. This time he sang directly to wife Hailey, 28, with admiration and affection. He dubbed the model ""iconic,"" and shouted out her viral Rhode lip gloss, tucked neatly into her iPhone case — a nod to her growing beauty empire. ""When sunlight turns to shadow and it gets hard to face. Like water to a flower, babe, I know you need the rain. Nothing needs to work out and nothing needs to break. Don't need to pretend that you're okay."" Bieber added, ""cry on my shoulder… stay by my side."" His wife Hailey showed her support, sharing several photos of his album cover on her Instagram story. Bieber's ""Swag"" album was spotted on billboards across major cities, including in Times Square, New York. She additionally posted on her social media that she listened to the track ""Daises."" Reps for Bieber did not respond to Fox News Digital's immediate request for comment. In May, Bieber made a public apology to his wife about her Vogue cover. He took to Instagram to share images from Hailey's photo shoot with Vogue. In his caption, he explained that he'd once told her she'd never land the cover of the legendary fashion magazine. ""Yo this reminds me when Hailey and I got into a huge fight,"" he wrote. ""I told hails that she would never be on the cover of vogue, Yikes I know, so mean."" ""For some reason because I felt so disrespected I thought I gotta get even... I think as we mature we realize that we're not helping anything by getting even. we're honestly just prolonging what we really want which is intimacy and connection."" Bieber, who has since deleted his caption, finished his post by dedicating a message directly to his wife, and wrote, ""So baby u already know but forgive me for saying u wouldn't get a vogue cover cuz clearly i was sadly mistaken."" Earlier that same month, Bieber admitted being ""flawed"" in a series of posts on social media. The singer, who had previously been in the spotlight for his behavior on social media causing concern among fans, wrote, ""I'm just an average flawed guy. I've done things that have hurt others. I continue to do and say things that hurt others unintentionally.""..."

You were my diamond. Gave you a ring. I made you a promise. I told you, I'd change. It's just human nature, these growing pains. And baby, I ain't walking away.” On Bieber's track “Daisies,” he appeared to paint a picture of emotional uncertainty as he questioned the strength of his relationship.

mov_C1B85C0F46589F1EBF72FCB53FDFF366,2025-07-11 15:45:29,en,WEB,"  Justin Bieber fans woke up to a blast from the past. On Friday, July 11, the singer released “SWAG,” a surprise album that is his first full-length studio project in four years. Despite no prior announcement, the rollout came together fast. Billboards promoting the album began popping up on Thursday, July 10, across the country, hours before Bieber confirmed the release of his seventh album by posting photos and videos on Instagram. A project months in the making Although the drop was unannounced, “SWAG” had been in the works for quite some time. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Bieber had been holding informal “jam sessions” at his home in recent months. Guests reportedly included his longtime DJ Tay James, musical director HARV, SZA collaborator Carter Lang and Australian artist Eddie Benjamin. Star-studded collaborations and viral nods The album spans 21 tracks and features a wide range of collaborators — including Gunna, Sexyy Red, Cash Cobain, Dijon, Lil B and Eddie Benjamin. Comedian Druski is also featured on three interludes. One track, “STANDING ON BUSINESS,” refers to a viral paparazzi clip from June in which Bieber used the now-memed phrase while confronting the press. Bieber was leaving Soho House Malibu in California in June when the exchange began, as Bieber approached paparazzi near his vehicle. One paparazzo asked the singer if he was afraid of being deported back to Canada amid ICE raids. The expletive-laden, 11-minute video showed a tense back-and-forth between Bieber and the press, where he eventually said, “I'm a human f—— being, you're standing around my car, at the beach!” Bieber added, “It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business, is it?” Themes of faith and vulnerability Beyond the guest list, “SWAG” dives into deeply personal territory. One of the final tracks, “FORGIVENESS,” features gospel legend Marvin Winans and reflects Bieber's long-standing connection to faith. Unbiased. Straight Facts.TM Justin Bieber became the youngest solo artist to achieve five No. 1 albums in the U.S. in 2013. Other songs address the emotional toll of public life and fame. On “THERAPY SESSION,” a skit with Druski, Bieber opens up about feeling overwhelmed. “It's feelin' like, you know, I have had to go through a lot of my struggles as a human,” he says. “As all of us do really publicly. And so people are always askin' if I'm okay. And that starts to really weigh on me.” That sense of emotional transparency also plays out in real life. Bieber recently made headlines amid rumors of tension in his marriage to model and skincare-product founder Hailey Bieber. Us Weekly cited sources who described the relationship as “tense.” Hailey, however, pushed back against the rumors, posting a video to her Instagram Story applying her viral Rhode lip treatment, with her engagement ring front and center. Speculation grew again after Justin posted a cryptic screenshot of a Father's Day text exchange, publicly ending a friendship he called “traumatizing.” “Conflict is a part of relationship,” he wrote. “If you don't like my anger, you don't like me.” Between the lyrics and the Instagram posts, “SWAG” feels like an emotional release, or at least a reset. Either way, it's a success. Hours after its release, “SWAG” shot to No. 1 on the U.S. Apple Music chart. Fans are already watching to see how it performs, since Bieber's last album, “Justice,” held the top spot on the Billboard 200 for two weeks in 2021. Matt Bishop (Digital Producer) and Ian Kennedy (Video Editor Manager) contributed to this report."

mov_0E57364C5303F8747147274B01B8CEAE,2025-07-11 16:34:41,en,WEB,"  A Southern state has reclaimed its crown as the best place for business in America — less than a decade after it faced a high-profile corporate boycott. North Carolina is the top state for business investment in 2025, according to CNBC's annual nationwide analysis. California is ranked 22, while New York gets the 23rd spot. The state is joined by two other southeast giants in the top five, with Texas in second place and Florida in third. It's the third time in four years the Tar Heel State has taken the top spot, previously earning the title in 2022 and 2023. North Carolina ranks in the top five in several of the study's most important business-readiness metrics. The state had the third-best GDP growth in 2024 (3.7 percent), ranked fourth for workforce quality, and saw a strong influx of Americans with STEM college degrees. It also has a lower corporate income tax rate than some of its national peers. Businesses are taking note: JetZero, an aviation startup, is building a factory in Greensboro expected to employ more than 14,000 workers. Amazon is also spending big in the state, making a $10 billion data center investment in June. 'In recent years, we've recruited businesses that have created tens of thousands of jobs across the state,' Josh Stein, the state's Democratic Governor, said during his recent state of the state address. 'But we cannot rest on our laurels. Other states want what we have here — it's a competitive world.' North Carolina's return to the top spot comes nine years after the state faced backlash from major corporations over legislation viewed as discriminatory. In 2016, Republican lawmakers passed a bill that restricted transgender people from using bathrooms aligned with their gender identity. The law prompted widespread corporate criticism. The NCAA pulled championship games from the state, PayPal and Deutsche Bank canceled planned investments, and Apple voiced its opposition. While the state has since rebuilt many of those corporate relationships, challenges remain. Hurricane Helene caused an estimated $60 billion in infrastructure damage, and North Carolina has requested $11.5 billion in recovery aid from FEMA. But the program itself is facing cuts from the Trump administration, which could slow or reduce federal support. Ports in Wilmington are also facing pressures from President Donald Trump's yoyo-ing tariff policies. International shipments into the port have slowed, threatening the region with scarcity and continued inflation. Other states are right on North Carolina's tale: Texas, Florida, Virginia, and Ohio round out the top-five in CNBC's rankings. Massachusetts, which ranked number 38 in 2024, jumped 18 spots to number 20. It was the biggest year-to-year move. Meanwhile, small and remote states continue to struggle in the rankings. Alaska, Hawaii, Montana, Rhode Island, and Louisiana closed out on the bottom of the list."

Once tobacco had been found to be a profitable cash crop, many plantations were established along the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia and Maryland. The colonists were met with hard times including famine, illness, and their relationship with the local Native American tribes. There were several historic events that took place in Jamestown between the settlers and the Native American tribes. When the settler John Rolfe married Pocohontas, there was a moment of peace between the two cultures. Prior to the union, Algonquian tribes battled the settlers. The year 1609 was known as the ""Starving Time"" since over 100 settlers died from starvation and illness. John Rolfe introduced a new type of tobacco seed from the West Indies, and the Jamestown society began to improve. [1] Thus began the first and longest era of immigration that lasted until the American Revolution in 1775. Settlements grew from initial English toeholds from the New World to British America. It brought Northern European immigrants, primarily of British, German, and Dutch extraction. The English ruled from the mid-17th century and were by far the largest group of arrivals remaining within the British Empire. Over 90% of those early immigrants became farmers. [2] Large numbers of young men and women came alone as indentured servants. Their passage was paid by employers in the colonies who needed help on the farms or in shops. Indentured servants were provided food, housing, clothing and training but did not receive wages. At the end of the indenture (usually around age 21, or after a service of seven years), they were free to marry and start their own farms. [3] New England Seeking religious freedom in the New World, 100 English Pilgrims established a small settlement near Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1620. Tens of thousands of English Puritans arrived, mostly from the East Anglia (Norfolk, Suffolk, Essex),[4] and settled in Boston, Massachusetts and the adjacent areas from around 1629 to 1640 to create a land dedicated to their religion. The earliest New English colonies, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island, and New Hampshire, were established along the northeastern coast. Large-scale immigration to this region ended before 1700, but a small but steady trickle of later arrivals continued. [5] Plymouth Colony was founded by a group of European settlers known as the pilgrims who had left Europe to separate from the Church of England and wanted religious freedom. They sailed from England on the Mayflower and arrived in 1620. Plymouth was part of the New England Confederation, made up of four Puritan colonies: Plymouth, Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Haven. The colonies formed an alliance to protect themselves from attacks from Native American tribes, the Dutch, and the French. [6] The Pilgrims were a small group of people from Scrooby, England. They originally left England to go to Holland because they faced persecution from the Church of England, and they eventually ended in North America, where they began a new life. The Netherlands provided the Puritans with somewhat more tolerance, but they felt that it was their calling to spread the word of the Gospel to the New World, which led them to America. [7] The New English colonists were the most urban and educated of all their contemporaries and had had many skilled farmers, tradesmen and craftsmen among them. They started the first university, Harvard, in 1635 to train their ministers. They mostly settled in small villages for mutual support (nearly all of them had their own militias) and common religious activities. Shipbuilding, commerce, agriculture, and fishing were their main sources of income. New England's healthy climate (the cold winters killed the mosquitoes and other disease-bearing insects), small widespread villages (minimizing the spread of disease), and abundant food supply resulted in the lowest death rate and the highest birth rate of any of the colonies. The eastern and northern frontier around the initial New England settlements was mainly settled by the descendants of the original New Englanders. Immigration to the New England colonies after 1640 and the start of the English Civil War decreased to less than 1% (about equal to the death rate) in nearly all of the years prior to 1845. The rapid growth of the New England colonies (approximately 900,000 by 1790) was almost entirely from the high birth rate (>3%) and the low death rate (<1%) per year. [8]"

But this year was different as she skipped the tradition. This was because Taylor Swift chose for a low-key celebration and now the details are out. Taylor Swift's Fourth of July celebration with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, was ultra-private and exclusive. Where did Taylor Swift spent her July 4 weekend? According to a report in Page Six, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce spent the holiday weekend at the luxurious Yellowstone Club in Big Sky, Mont., according to DeuxMoi. The resort is no stranger to catering to wealthy and famous clientele. Located in the heart of the northern Rock Mountains, the lavish Yellowstone Club attracts major high-profile celebrities and hosts famous members including Tom Brady, Ben Affleck, and even Bill Gates. Celebs are attracted to nature, landscapes, and opulence of Yellowstone Club, reports The Daily Mail. The report suggests that the Yellowstone Club, that spans across 15,200 acres in Big Sky, Montana is known for its exclusivity, privacy and luxury amenities. Members and their guests can enjoy 2,700 acres of 'Private Powder,' 18 lifts, more than 100 trails of varying difficulty, drops of 2,700 vertical feet and a terrain park for snowboarders and skiers. Properties on the resort range up to $25million, while the joining fee is now $400,000 in addition to $41,500 in annual dues. The resort has a set limit of 864 members, which included Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen, Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel, Bill and Melinda Gates and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. On top of that, you have to own real estate in the area to even qualify for membership. Members must own property in the community and pay pricey annual membership fees. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce July 4 weekend It remains unclear where Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce stayed. The club is estimated to have between 50 and 80 billionaire members, according to Forbes Australia. The club's 900 homeowners are worth more than a combined $290 billion. Summer activities for members include exclusive access to an 18-hole golf course and water activities like kayaking and paddle boarding. Given Swift and Kelce's love for eating out at trendy restaurants, it's presumed that they enjoyed the fine dining at the Yellowstone Club. Kelce was spotted rocking a Yellowstone Club T-shirt on the latest episode of his “New Heights” podcast. The couple appears to favor spending time in Montana, as they enjoyed a secret snowy getaway there in March. Swift's low-key celebration with Kelce is certainly a big change from her iconic Fourth of July parties hosted at her Watch Hill, RI, mansion in years' past. The couple has recently enjoyed more low-key downtime together and have reportedly forged an even stronger bond. “It's been a turning point for their relationship in a lot of ways,” an insider told People. “They're incredibly happy and in sync.

The model's response is a clear reference to a recent video of her husband confronting paparazzi that went viral last month . “You're not getting it, it's not clocking to you,” Justin said in the June 13 clip. “It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business.” Justin, 31, also addressed divorce rumors on his album, seemingly revealing in the lyrics for his new song “Walking Away” that he and his wife would stick out any difficult moments together. “Days go by so fast, don't wanna spend them with you / so tell me why you're throwing stones at my back / You know I'm defenseless,” he sings, adding, “And, girl, we better stop before we say some s— / We've been testing our patience / I think we're better off if we just take a break / And remember what grace is.” In the chorus, Justin adds, “Baby, I ain't walking away / You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away.” Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber attend Super Bowl LVI at SoFi Stadium on February 13, 2022 in Inglewood, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/ for Roc Nation) Justin also sings about spending time away from his wife while figuring things out in “Daisies,” which includes the lyrics, “Throwin' petals like, 'Do you love me or not?' / Head is spinnin', and it don't know when to stop / You said 'Forever,' babe, did you mean it or not? / Hold on, hold on.” “You leave me on read, babe, but I still get the message / Instead of a line it's three dots, but I can connect them / And if it ain't right, babe, you know I respect it / But if you need time, just take your time / Honey, I get it, I get it, I get it,” he sings.

mov_FDEECFB4CCF625D3141C81CF94707112,2025-07-11 18:58:21,en,WEB,"  FORT KNOX, KY. – In the early hours of the day, Cadets assigned to Alpha Company, 6th Regiment, Advanced Camp, marched to the starting point of the six-mile battle march and shoot, July 5, 2025. The star lit sky and chilling damp air encouraged Cadets before they stepped off to start their trek. Cadet Irene Torrez Flores, University of Connecticut, continued to stay positive throughout the physical and mental exhaustion by remembering why she started. Among several reasons, Torrez joined ROTC due to her passion to help others. Her father was never able to join the Army because of medical reasons, yet her family has a history of service. Torrez's father passed in 2009, and her mom needed to work extensive hours to provide for her family. Torrez stepped up to take care of her siblings and continues to look out for them today. Torrez is the oldest of her three younger sisters; one of them is planning to join ROTC at the University of Rhode Island. “I really want to take everything I learn here and pass it down to her so that maybe one day she will end up being better than I am,” she said. Torrez grew up in a tight-knit family due to their incredibly open and communicative household. Her mother, from El Salvador, and her father, from Nicaragua, raised her to be kind and empathetic to others. According to Torrez, people here keep to themselves and rarely talk about internal battles, which was a big cultural shock for her. “If I can show someone that I can open up about myself after everything I've been through it might help others do it too,” Torrez Flores said. “I know people think if you are in the military you have to be hardcore and not show emotions, but that is not the case.” It is human nature to stereotype, but Torrez has found ways to empathize rather than judge. Her bubbly personality encourages vulnerable leadership. Even though some see it as a weakness, Torres is already seeing it create stronger bonds and build the confidence of her squadmates. Unlike her, Cadet Ahmad Alkilani, Temple University, is an introvert and does not often show vulnerability, but Torrez is rubbing off on him. “Her ability to be outgoing and put her ego aside to ask for help has shown me no one's judging and we are all here to do the same thing,” Alkilani said. “We are going to be together through a month and a half so we might as well help each other.” Being in the same squad, Alkilani and Torrez have developed trust in each other. Both believe that trust in your team comes when you stay humble and remember everyone is equal. According to Alkilani, you should not ask others to do something you won't do yourself. Building trust is a high priority for many officers, but first you must have confidence in your own abilities. Torrez has practiced that belief every day to embrace the challenges of CST. One of the Cadre referenced David Goggins, motivational speaker, author and United States Navy SEAL, regarding his '40% Rule,' “When your mind is telling you that you're done, that you're exhausted, that you cannot possibly go any further, you're only actually 40% done.” While participating in the six-mile ruck portion of BMS Cadets faced several challenges. Torrez kept this quote in mind as she approached Agony Hill. She stayed positive and reminded herself that everyone else is going through the same thing. Torrez came into Cadet Summer Training with an open mind, getting to know as many people as possible and bond through the challenges they face together. Her passion to make a difference and help others continues to evolve as the words her mother said to her when she joined ROTC encourage her, “your dad would be so proud.” Date Taken: 07.05.2025 Date Posted: 07.11.2025 14:58 Story ID: 542582 Location: FORT KNOX, KENTUCKY, US Web Views: 0 Downloads: 0 PUBLIC DOMAIN"
mov_CFB8F23D716EB6EE4D635DA129081ECD,2025-07-11 19:03:37,en,WEB,"  Justin Bieber is getting his swag back. The artist, who welcomed his first child with wife Hailey Bieber last year, surprised fans this Thursday by announcing his seventh studio album, Swag, would drop just 24 hours later. Now, the album is here, and it's offering some subtle peeks into the singer's personal life. Much has been said about Bieber in the years since he dropped his last studio album, 2021's Justice. The star famously postponed the album's tour, before canceling it due to exhaustion, making a pledge to prioritize his health. And in recent months, Bieber's erratic behavior, both on social media and in public, has stirred concern among fans and sparked tabloid rumors of everything from an intervention to an impending divorce from Hailey. Bieber isn't directly responding to any of those rumors, but the existence of his new album is prompting speculation from some about whether his more alarming conduct (including a now viral paparazzi rant) may have been just a promotional stunt. We may never know — but here are some insights from Bieber's Swag that could give fans a look at his inner world. Bieber has a 'therapy session' with Druski Swag's “Therapy Session” isn't so much a song as it is an interlude. The track reveals a conversation between Bieber and comedian Druski, in which Druski and Bieber reflect on the singer's public image. “Even sometimes where I know you're trolling, and they don't even understand it, like, 'Oh my God, he's f    ing losin' his mind,” Druski says on the track. “And it's like, 'Nah, I think he's just being a human being. He's enjoying social media like the f   ing rest of us. He's just doing it his own way.” Bieber then tells Druski on the track that because he's had to go through a lot of his struggles publicly, he's constantly being asked if he's OK — which starts to “really weigh” on him. “It starts to make me feel like I'm the one with issues and everyone else is perfect,” Bieber says. On the state of his marriage with Hailey Much has been said about Bieber's relationship with Hailey, who he had a brief relationship with in 2016 before the two reunited and quickly married after a few weeks together in 2018. The couple welcomed their son, Jack Blues Bieber, last year, but their relationship has been plagued with tabloid rumors, fueled occasionally by the couple's social media presence. But whatever drama has — or hasn't — occurred between the couple, Bieber seems to send a strong message on Swag's title track. “Baby, I ain't walking away / You were my diamond Gave you a ring I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,” Bieber sings on the track. More in Entertainment The singer seemingly references the ups and downs of a relationship again in “First Place,” with lyrics like “Oh (All I see is you now, all I see is you now), in the first place / Oh (Don't wanna lose you now), and that's thе worst case.” He also waxes poetic about settling down with his love on “Way It Is,” with lines such as, “I'm dreamin' of reachin' and pullin' you closer / We could settle down / I'm dreamin' of a place that we can go away / Time isn't slowin', and there's nobody around.” Bieber shouts out Hailey's beauty prowess Hailey's skincare company, Rhode, gets a shout-out on the album — specifically, the brand's cellphone case, which comes with a lip gloss holder. “That's my baby, she's iconic, iPhone case, lip gloss on it,” Bieber sings on the track “Go Baby.” But it's not just the lip gloss that gets a shout out: Bieber also clocks the many rumors that have swirled about Hailey on social media, singing, “She keeps 'em talkin', it's comedy, just block it.” He also shares supportive words on the song: “When sunlight turns to shadow and it gets hard to face / Like water to a flower, babe, I know you need the rain / Nothing needs to work out and nothing needs to break / Don't need to pretend that you're OK.” Bieber also makes what might be another reference to Hailey's ability to win with beauty trends on the song “Devotion” with the line, “Your lips and fingernails are all glowing.” Hmm, a possible reference not only to Rhode's lip gloss, but also Hailey's viral glazed doughnut nails? A return to the paparazzi rant Bieber even sampled his own paparazzi rant in “Standing on Business,” another interlude track featuring Druski. Back in June, Bieber was confronted by a paparazzo outside of Soho House in Malibu, resulting in an 11-minute argument between the pop star and videographer, in which Bieber was heard on video saying, “You're not getting it, it's not clocking to you…It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business.” Bieber's words went viral, particularly his line about “standing on business” — which then became a part of the intro to his track of the same name. While “Standing on Business” isn't a song, it is another way for Bieber to playfully poke fun at his recent public drama, with Druski commenting on his proper pronunciation of “business” in the rant. “I'ma start goin' to beach and lookin' for motherf   ers just to say that s  t, too,” Druski joked."

So idk if I believe her reply to you bc I've totally seen her buying Zio brands in the past, I remember being shocked. I believe it Rhode she purchased and I wash shocked bc I remember her grandfathers farm in Palestine being burned by the IOF! She shared this maybe last year! Yet here she is still supporting Zio brands. Like idk maybe she was gifted the Rhode lipstick but still, why support it by showing it to your audience??? Other influencers don't get as much heat as the asads, which makes sense since they're one of the biggest but they deserve heat too. Zaina Elyassin also always links and purchases boycott brands.

n2lpt58,2025-07-11 19:18:42,en,REDDIT,"  You have a legitimate concern. Yet I would not call the scouts first hotline on this (as other people are suggesting). The only part of YPT that would touch this is the anti-bullying policy; however, as you describe this situation it wasn't bullying. Scouting America has a very specific definition of bullying and this does not meet that criteria. Scouting America has a vague reference to ""Any threat or usage of a weapon."" statement in relation to bullying and in those cases the reporting path is to the council executive when ""warranted"". Your situation in my opinion is not quite there. There was 1 incident between you and this scout, and nothing verbal; the scout was reportedly acting strange all week, being strange isn't a crime, maybe he got confused when you asked to see the knife, and then scared when you verbally confronted him. That being said I would have your parents go with you to engage the troop leadership to notify your council executive. Let him make the decision on what to do next. If it is deemed a YPT violation you probably won't hear much back. Strangely enough publicizing rule violations is considering hazing by Scouting America. At most you will get back something stating that the situation has been handled**. I would not worry about saying ""WTF are you doing?"" anyone in your situation would have probably said the same thing. Anyone focusing on that part of your situation is just redirecting and incompetent. The core of this is the kid with the knife, was a he threat to you, is he a threat to himself, is he a threat to others? That's what we need to figure out. **The real zinger here is going to be that if your scout executive or if the scout executive of the hosting council up in Rhode Island deems this a YPT situation it will trigger a national investigation since it is a cross council situation. If that is the case, they (the councils involved) will have to interview everyone involved or who witnessed the situation and report back to national. You will know if this goes higher and is investigated because you will be interviewed. In this situation at a minimum it will be deemed a near miss and go on all involved councils annual safety reports."

mov_4027D5E79C887E4BE4C88889FAC868D9,2025-07-11 20:08:55,en,WEB,"  According to the National Council of State Boards of Nursing, around 5.8 million registered and practical nurses provide essential care in the U.S. healthcare industry. This critical role is both challenging and rewarding. You may qualify for extra discounts on your auto insurance because of your role as a nurse, especially if you've joined one of the qualifying professional organizations. My research found that several major insurance companies, including Liberty Mutual, GEICO, and Travelers, offer discounts on car insurance for nurses. Other companies, like Root, offer competitive rates regardless of your occupation. Ultimately, the right car insurance company for you will depend on your coverage needs and driving frequency. How we evaluate products FinanceBuzz researches a number of factors in each auto insurance provider to create our reviews. These factors include cost and discounts, complaints and customer satisfaction, coverage, and ease of use. We also gather information from sources such as Insurify, J.D. Power, AM Best, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), and the Better Business Bureau to ensure we provide the most useful information to our readers. Best car insurance for nurses Liberty Mutual Best for its nurse discount program Company details AM Best: A (Stable) J.D. Power claims satisfaction: 717/1,000 (study average 697) BBB: A- NAIC complaints: 3.16 (private passenger) Liberty Mutual is a leading insurance company with one of the highest discounts for nurses. Members of the American Association of Registered Nurses or the American Nurses Association can save as much as 12% on their policies in eligible states. This insurance company offers valuable coverage options, including guaranteed asset protection (GAP) and new car replacement insurance. It also has a strong reputation in the industry; in the , it was ranked fifth out of 21 insurance companies. Plus, it offers the IntelliDrive telematics program in many states. However, Liberty Mutual tends to be on the more expensive side, with higher-than-average rates for liability-only and full coverage policies. The insurer also has a much higher-than-expected number of complaints with the NAIC. Pros Higher potential discount for nurses Strong J.D. Power customer satisfaction rating Sells GAP and new car replacement insurance Cons Higher-than-average rates Higher-than-usual number of NAIC complaints Doesn't offer the nursing discount in all states Learn more in our Liberty Mutual review. Root Best for usage-based insurance Company details AM Best: Not rated J.D. Power claims satisfaction: Not rated BBB: A- NAIC complaints: 1.93 (private passenger) If you're a nurse with a short commute to your workplace, you may drive fewer miles than most. And, if you have a relatively clean driving record, you could benefit from signing up for coverage through Root. Root is a company specializing in usage-based insurance (UBI) policies. It bases your premiums on your vehicle use and driving habits (such as your speed, acceleration, and braking). If you drive safely, you might save hundreds on full coverage through Root. Only those with good driving records are eligible for coverage. Also, Root's policies aren't available everywhere. As of 2025, you can't get a policy in Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, North Carolina, New Jersey, New York, Vermont, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Washington, Wyoming, or Washington, D.C. Pros Cheaper-than-average rates for safe drivers Doesn't consider credit scores when calculating rates Offers rental car coverage and roadside assistance Cons Not available in all 50 states Doesn't provide coverage to those with driving infractions Penalized for recent data breaches Learn more in our Root review. Travelers Best for traveling nurses Company details AM Best: A++ (Superior) J.D. Power claims satisfaction: 684/1,000 (study average 697) BBB: A+ NAIC complaints: 3.96 (private passenger) Travel nursing is a potentially lucrative career path. By relocating to work at different healthcare facilities that need trained nurses, you could make a higher-than-average salary and get help covering your living expenses. However, that might mean flying to different destinations and frequently renting vehicles. If you often rent cars, you may benefit from non-owner policies. While not all insurance companies sell this form of coverage, Travelers has coverage for you and your passengers in case you're in an accident while in a car that isn't yours. Travelers also offers affinity discounts for members of membership or employment organizations, so you might qualify for an additional premium reduction. However, the insurer has a lower-than-average customer satisfaction rating. And though it offers rideshare insurance, this coverage isn't available everywhere. Pros Sells non-owner policies Offers a potential affinity discount for nurses Has many general savings programs and policy options Cons Below-average customer satisfaction and a high number of NAIC complaints Doesn't offer several discounts nationwide Limited rideshare insurance availability Learn more in our Travelers review. Nationwide Best for new car owners Company details AM Best: A (Stable) J.D. Power claims satisfaction: 728/1,000 (study average 697) BBB: A+ NAIC complaints: 0.39 (private passenger) As a nurse, you need a reliable car. If you decide to purchase a new vehicle for peace of mind, Nationwide could be a good option for you. The insurer offers GAP insurance, which helps cover the difference between your car's value and loan balance if your car is totaled or stolen. Additionally, it offers other optional products, including roadside assistance, a total loss deductible waiver, a vanishing deductible, and accident forgiveness. Nationwide has a strong reputation for customer service. The company ranked fourth for claims satisfaction in J.D. Power's study and topped its list of car insurance companies offering UBI policies. It also has a much lower-than-expected number of NAIC complaints. However, despite its name, Nationwide isn't available everywhere. Residents of Alaska, Hawaii, Louisiana, and Massachusetts will have to obtain coverage elsewhere. Pros Sells GAP insurance for new cars Offers several other optional add-on coverages Strong J.D. Power customer satisfaction ratings Very low number of NAIC complaints Cons Not available in all 50 states Smaller independent insurance agent network Learn more in our Nationwide review. GEICO Best for multiple savings programs Company details AM Best: A++ (Superior) J.D. Power claims satisfaction: 692/1,000 (study average 697) BBB: A+ NAIC complaints: 0.75 (private passenger) GEICO allows customers to shop for and purchase coverage entirely online...."

The 31-year-old “Peaches” singer's newest album, “Swag,” arrived Friday with 21 new songs and plenty of grist for the rumor mill. “Daisies,” the second track, asks, “Throwin' petals like, 'Do you love me or not?' … You said 'Forever,' babe, did you mean it or not?” The Grammy winner then croons, “If you need time, just take your time/ Honey, I get it, I get it, I get it.” Fourth track, “Go Baby,” acknowledges when “it gets hard to face … Nothing needs to work out and nothing needs to break/ Don't need to pretend that you're OK.” But maybe the most telling of the songs is “Walking Away,” in which Bieber sings “I think we better off if we just take a break/ And remember what grace is. “Baby, I ain't walking away/ You were my diamond/ Gave you a ring/ I made you a promise/ I told you I'd change/ It's just human nature/ These growing pains/ And baby, I ain't walking away.” Hailey, 28, on Thursday reportedly captioned a shot of the album cover art, “Is it finally clocking to you f–ing losers?” in an Instagram story. At the time of publication, that particular post was not up. In May, in the cover story for Vogue's Summer Issue, the Rhode founder shut down any speculation that the marriage is on the rocks. On the contrary, she said, the majority of stories published about her are “not real.” “Swag” marks Bieber's seventh studio album and first since 2021's “Justice.”"

Holt, McDonald and Heiss all have listed themselves as San Diego State assistants on their social media accounts, though SDSU has not yet officially announced the hirings. However, SDSU has announced that 19 transfers will play for the Aztecs this spring. The group includes 14 players from power programs - seven of whom played at Oregon State. As for the coaches, Holt brings the greatest amount of experience to the staff. The Indiana native was an outfielder at Florida State who was drafted in 2010 by the Cleveland Indians (now Guardians). He reached the major leagues in 2014, splitting the next three seasons between Cleveland and Cincinnati Reds. Holt was the hitting coach at Boston College, where spent the past four seasons. McDonald, who grew up in Santa Rosa, joined the Arizona staff last season as a graduate manager. He was a catcher on the 2024 Wildcats team. Heiss, who listed recruiting coordinator on his X (formerly Twitter) bio, spent the past four seasons on the Rhode Island staff. He began his coaching career in 2019 at McDaniel College, where he was starting shortstop from 2017-19. The coaches greet a 34-man roster that is mostly comprised of transfers and incoming freshman recruits. The seven Beavers transfers include infielders Dawson Santana, Jabin Trosky, Levi Jones, Tyce Peterson and Reeve Boyd, catcher Anthony Marnell and pitcher Drew Talavs. Most of them played sparingly, if at all, over the past two seasons. Peterson is the most accomplished: He made 43 starts this season for the Beavers, batting .288 with five home runs, 20 RBIs and 10 doubles. The Aztecs also signed right-handers Carson Johnson and Bryce McKnight, both of whom pitched in relief under Vance at Arizona. Johnson made 12 appearances while McKnight pitched in six games. There was one local player among the signees. Right-hander Trey Telfer (Cathedral Catholic High School) returns to town after playing the 2025 season at Indiana, where he made nine relief appearances totaling 8 2/3 innings.

mov_20B2BD2A0BE3D74094C8654507D259B7,2025-07-11 23:00:53,en,WEB,"  Girl is one of my most favorite films. Lead actress Dominique Swain was the teen idol of art house/indie cinema in the late '90s and early 2000s. Though, around this time, I was still becoming aware of her filmography post her role in the buzzy remake of Lolita in 1997. When I randomly came across Girl on one of the movie channels on cable television, I had missed the first ten minutes, but I kept watching as I knew Swain was in it already and the vibe was immediately cozy. I even sensed that film had a slight bluesy filter to it that was so cool. And as I kept watching, more and more familiar actresses appeared including Selma Blair, Tara Reid, Portia de Rossi, and faces I recognized, but couldn't identify by name. (Later, I would know the actors were Summer Phoenix and Christopher Masterson. I especially enjoyed Reid and Phoenix in their supporting roles. I could tell this film was made before Reid was in American Pie and Blair in Cruel Intentions, both of which came out in 1999). Girl, based on the novel by Blake Nelson, is a classic coming-of-age story starring a teenage girl on the precipice of life beyond her backwater town in Washington state, as she's been accepted to Brown University in Rhode Island. (At least in the film. I haven't read the book!) Before moving across the country, she wants to, for once, live her life to fullest and expand her reach and knowledge past her usual friend group and hobbies, in addition to acknowledging her budding physical desires. It's a great film. And while I always held the scene with de Rossi's character above as one of my faves. It certainly holds more weight as an adult admirer of the film. I first watched Girl when I was in my early teens. It came out 1998. I must've seen it in 2000 or 2001. Almost caught up with the original Chilling Adventures of Sabrina series! I've been discovering some short animated films on YouTube lately. “Influenced” at this point covers an evergreen topic. Fiona's speech was bad ass in 1997. And it's bad ass now in 2025. I can't recall if I've ever saw this video starring Michelle Trachtenberg. She looked so stunning in it! When news was confirmed that she had passed way, back in the spring, I was quite touched by it. It was such a sad day for her loved ones and our '90s childhood. I watched her on Nickelodeon as a kid and saw her in her first lead role as Harriet in Harriet the Spy at the movie theater back in 1996. ❤ This mash-up of Beyonce's songs “All Night” (the instrumental) with the lyrics of “Tyrant” is so fantastic!

mov_EE1377B310F6F958731F1C1D461C01EF,2025-07-11 23:23:04,en,WEB,"  PROVIDENCE, R.I. (WPRI) — Butler Hospital presented union leaders with its revised ""last, best and final"" contract proposal on Friday, as what is now considered the longest hospital strike in Rhode Island history remains ongoing. More than 800 workers at Butler have been on strike since May 15, demanding higher wages, better benefits and improved workplace safety. Now, the hospital is calling on the New England Health Care Employees Union (SEIU 1199NE) to end what it's described as ""grandstanding and rhetoric"" and prioritize patient care by presenting the offer to members. The proposal includes ""market-leading wages, competitive benefits, and improvements to workplace safety,"" according to the hospital. “We respect the right of workers to organize and advocate for better compensation, benefits, retirement, and working conditions,” said Scott Van Steeden, Butler Hospital's vice president of operations. ""We are confident that our revised last, best, and final offer to SEIU provides exactly that."" He added that the proposal ""honors and respects"" the professionals who care for the state's most vulnerable patients. READ ALSO: Butler workers question Care New England's finances amid contract dispute What's in the offer? Pay According to Butler Hospital, the proposal would raise the minimum wage for lowest paid workers to over $18 per hour, which is 20% higher than Rhode Island's minimum wage. Mental health workers would earn $21.79 an hour, which is a 19.3% increase and 25.4% above average regional market rates. Starting pay for registered nurses would be $36 an hour — a 10.8% increase from current contract wages and 9.8% higher than average regional market rates. Benefits No changes will be made to employee retirement benefits and the pension system will be protected, Butler said. A gradual phase-out of the 65% employer contribution to the HSA deductible would be offset by a 100% reduction in premiums for the Network Blue NE Plan for full-time individuals, and a $21.66 monthly premium for family plans. Additionally, Butler said the HSA plan will remain available with a $0 premium for those who choose it. Safety A Workplace Violence Prevention Task Force would be created, along with a support plan for employees injured due to workplace violence. According to Butler, workers would be able to donate unused sick or vacation time to injured colleagues who have already exhausted their own. The hospital said it would ""seed"" that fund with $75,000 in leave time and match up to $25,000 in additional donations. RELATED: Striking Butler Hospital employees awarded unemployment benefits The hospital noted that SEIU 1199's labor strike has put patient care across the state's entire health system at risk and unnecessary strain on emergency departments. ""The labor strike has forced Butler Hospital to close 40 beds and a number of units, which has led to more treatment of mental and behavioral health crises in emergency rooms and larger waitlists for treatment,"" Butler wrote. Hospital leadership also claimed that the union has made false statements to media throughout its campaign regarding members being ""locked out"" or barred from returning to work. Union response Meanwhile, a committee of striking workers with SEIU 1199 criticized the proposal as a bad-faith move. ""The language of Butler's last, best and final offer says it all — this is not a negotiation, it's an ultimatum,"" the committee wrote. ""Butler delivered the proposal ... while simultaneously hitting send on its press release announcing it. That is not how good faith bargaining works."" The union said it will evaluate the proposal and decide on next steps. ""We will not be strong-armed into accepting a contract that moves us even further back than where we started,"" the statement concluded.

mov_36C4DEED34B0B9AB7890746353F01783,2025-07-11 23:53:52,en,WEB,"  WASHINGTON, DC – Approximately $30 million for Rhode Island public schools and educational programs is in limbo after the Trump Administration froze federal funding that had previously been approved by Congress. Today, U.S. Senators Jack Reed (D-RI) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) joined Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Vice Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and twenty-nine colleagues in sending a letter to President Trump's Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russ Vought and U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon demanding the immediate release of nearly $7 billion in funding for K-12 schools and adult literacy programs across America that the Trump administration abruptly let states and school districts know it would indefinitely block last week. The Trump Administration's decision to withhold the funding has sent school districts nationwide scrambling to determine how they could fill the massive budget hole and whether they'll have to lay off teachers or end after school programs in the coming weeks. Rhode Island faces the potential loss of nearly $30 million in federal education as a result of the abrupt cutoff of education funds by the Trump Administration and may be forced to end afterschool programs, specialized literacy programs, educator training, and support for English language learners as a result of this misguided executive maneuver. The funding was expected to be disbursed by the federal government on July 1 and impacts every school district across the state. Nationwide, school districts have already told parents to prepare backup options, and adult literacy programs have already been forced to lay off staff. “We are writing to demand an immediate end to the illegal withholding of nearly $7 billion in federal education formula grant funds our states and communities are expecting for the coming school year, which is set to begin in just a few weeks in some communities,” write the 32 U.S. Senators. “These funds were made available by the bipartisan Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, signed into law on March 15, 2025. Yet, instead of supporting the tens of millions of students and adult learners intended to benefit from these investments, the administration has chosen to continue an unprecedented and opaque 'programmatic review' of these formula grant funds past the July 1, 2025, date these funds became available for allotment to states.” The lawmakers blasted the administration for its abrupt notice and illegal freeze of the funds, which has sent school districts and programs nationwide scrambling: “We are shocked by the continued lack of respect for states and local schools evidenced by this latest action by the administration.” They note that blocking funding for before and after school programs, as well as summer learning programs, is already hurting families nationwide: “By withholding these funds from states, the Department will impact programs for nearly 1.4 million students served by 10,000 summer and before and afterschool programs around the nation, which the Department's latest performance report showed supported significant improvements in student attendance, grades, and teacher reports of student engagement in learning. These centers also help working parents by providing a safe and productive place for their children to be after the school day ends and during the summer months. It is beyond comprehension why the administration would want to jeopardize these outcomes.” Warning of how denying these funds will cause schools to lay off teachers and cut back on teacher training, they write: “This rash decision will only worsen school working conditions and teacher shortages.” The lawmakers also detail how the move affects adult learners nationwide: “This pause could jeopardize services to more than 1.2 million adult learners working to develop foundational literacy and numeracy skills needed to enter and succeed in workforce training and health, financial, digital, and information literacy skills necessary for full participation in community and civic life. The withholding will have an even more significant impact on 12 states that rely on these funds for 70 to 75 percent of their adult education programs.” The Trump administration has confirmed it is blocking funding for the following programs—all of which are programs President Trump has requested to eliminate in his budget request, raising serious concerns about this administration's intentions to simply impound the funding: Supporting Effective Instruction State Grants (Title II-A), which support professional development and other activities to improve the effectiveness of teachers and school leaders, including reducing class size. 21st Century Community Learning Centers (Title IV-B), which support high-quality before and after-school programs focused on providing academic enrichment opportunities for students. Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants (Title IV-A), which provide flexible funding for school districts for a wide range of activities including supporting STEM education, accelerated learning courses, college and career counseling, school-based mental health services, and improving school technology, among many others. English Language Acquisition (Title III-A), which supports language instruction to help English language learners become proficient in English. Migrant Education (Title I-C), which supports the educational needs of migratory children, including children of migrant and seasonal farmworkers. Adult Basic and Literacy Education State Grants (including Integrated English Literacy and Civics Education State Grants), which support adult education and literacy programs to provide the basic skills to help prepare adults and out-of-school youth for success in the workforce. In addition to Senators Murray, Reed, and Whitehouse, the letter was also signed by Senators Bernie Sanders (I-VT), Tammy Baldwin (D-WI), Chuck Schumer (D-NY), Maize Hirono (D-HI), Cory Booker (D-NJ), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-MD), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), John Fetterman (D-PA), Chris Coons (D-DE), Ron Wyden (D-OR), Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH), John Hickenlooper (D-CO), Dick Durbin (D-IL), Martin Heinrich (D-NM), Chris Van Hollen (D-NM), Andy Kim (D-NJ), Maggie Hassan (D-NH), Ed Markey (D-MA), Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), Brian Schatz (D-HI), Alex Padilla (D-CA), Tina Smith (D-MN), Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), Tim Kaine (D-VA), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Gary Peters (D-MI), Angela Alsobrooks (D-MD), Tammy Duckworth (D-IL), and Jeff Merkley (D-OR). Full text of the letter follows: Dear Director Vought and Secretary McMahon: We are writing to demand an immediate end to the illegal withholding of nearly $7 billion in federal education formula grant funds our states and communities are expecting for the coming school year, which is set to begin in just a few weeks in some communities. These funds were made available by the bipartisan Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act, 2025, signed into law on March 15, 2025. Yet, instead of supporting the tens of millions of students and adult learners intended to benefit from these investments, the administration has chosen to continue an unprecedented and opaque “programmatic review” of these formula grant funds past the July 1, 2025, date these funds became available for allotment to states. This delay not only undermines effective state and local planning for using these funds to address student needs consistent with federal education law, which often takes place months before these funds become available, but also flies in the face of the nation's education laws which confers state and local education..."

mov_942C049ECC8C9CC97C6C867C60086E96,2025-07-12 00:12:58,en,WEB,"  Federal government workers are nothing like the overpaid and too-numerous lot that Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy and their attendant DOGE commission, say they are. In fact, federal workers have perhaps been among the groups of workers who've been least accomplished at advancing their interests over the past 40 years. The reality of how federal workers are and have been treated should be a focal point for a defeated and disorganized left, whether among the moderates blaming the far left or among those who agree with Bernie Sanders that party leadership has lost touch with workers. The fight for federal workers is the first battle in the upcoming assault on the federal government. The left would be wise to use a full-throated defense of federal workers an opportunity to portray Donald Trump, Musk, Ramaswamy and the entire GOP as cruel and unconcerned with actual working people. One notable aspect of the ongoing discussions of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency is the dearth of actual federal workers amongst those discussing the matter. As an employee of the Bureau of Economic Analysis for over 15 years, ending in March 2022, I can tell you the situation has gotten steadily worse for decades. Federal workers are underpaid, mistreated and lack the voice in society to fight back. And they've proven to be the proverbial canary in the coal mine. The federal workforce, as a share of the total U.S.population, has shrunk since 1982. In October 1982, there were 2.890 million federal workers. Forty-two years later,in October 2024,that figure totaled 3.001 million, a miserly increase of less than four percent. During that same period, the total U.S. population increased over 104 million, or about forty-five percent. Total local government employment grew from 9.430 million to 14.940 million over those forty-two years, an increase of nearly five million, while state government employment grew from 3.636 million to 5.514 million, an increase of about 1.9 million. Thus, state and local government employment basically kept up with forty-five percent population growth over those years, while federal employment barely grew at all. Nor are federal workers overpaid. Actually, their pay has been eroding relative to private sector counterparts for the last three decades. The Federal Employees Pay Comparability Act (FEPCA) was passed in 1990 to increase federal worker pay to catch up to private-sector pay. Federal statue written from FEPCA guides for annual federal employee pay increases to be calculated as half of one percent less than the increase in the employment cost index (ECI), a measure of total worker compensation prepared by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). however,according to the same statute,the president may ignore the ECI in cases of “national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare” and simply come up with a lower number. Since FEPCA was passed in 1990, eve The Shrinking Federal Workforce and the Myth of Waste The narrative of a bloated, inefficient federal bureaucracy is a persistent one, notably favored by those seeking to dismantle government functions. But a closer look at the numbers reveals a workforce that is not only smaller than manny realize, but also operating with remarkable efficiency – and increasingly, at a cost to public safety and service. As of 2023, the federal government employed roughly 2.3 million people (excluding Postal workers, intelligence agencies, and some smaller entities), according to the FedScope Federal Workforce Database. Over 750,000 of these workers are in the Department of Defense, with another half million at the Veterans Administration and over 200,000 at Homeland Security. this leaves approximately 800,000 employees to handle everything else – from tax collection and national park maintenance to nuclear safety, Pell Grants, and criminal prosecution. This relatively small workforce is responsible for a vast array of critical functions, often with dwindling resources. The Social Security Administration, for example, manages $1.4 trillion in annual benefits with fewer than 60,000 employees. Its administrative costs are remarkably low,at just 0.5% of annual benefits – a quarter of what they were fifty years ago, and significantly cheaper than private retirement annuities. Similarly, the Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS), tasked with ensuring the safety of our food supply, has seen its workforce shrink by fifteen percent as 2004, despite a nearly fifty percent increase in the size of the economy. This decline coincides with a 23-point drop in Americans' confidence in food safety, as revealed by a recent Gallup poll. Tragically, three FSIS workers died of COVID-19 while continuing their essential duties during the pandemic's initial surge. The rhetoric of waste and inefficiency is frequently enough deployed by politicians seeking to justify cuts. Donald Trump, Elon Musk, and Vivek Ramaswamy are among those confidently asserting the existence of a bloated federal workforce.Though, they rarely offer specifics, relying rather on broad dismissals. Ramaswamy even proposed a plan to cut the workforce by 50% based on whether an employee's Social Security number ends in an odd or even number – a policy demonstrating a shocking disregard for expertise and public service. This pattern of disparaging federal workers while concurrently benefiting from their services is not new. Barack Obama appointed Penny Pritzker, a figure known for her anti-worker behaviour, as Commerce Secretary despite her record. More recently, Gina Raimondo, Biden's current Commerce Secretary, cut state workers' pensions while Treasurer of Rhode Island, prioritizing hedge fund investments.These appointments raise questions about the commitment of even Democratic administrations to supporting and valuing the federal workforce. The reality is that the federal government is operating with a lean workforce, and further cuts risk compromising essential services and public safety. The myth of a bloated bureaucracy serves as a convenient justification for dismantling vital government functions, but the numbers tell a different story.Okay, here's a rewritten version of the Salon.com article, aiming for 100% uniqueness while preserving the core argument and quality. I've focused on considerable paraphrasing, reorganization, added context, and new headings/subheadings. I've also tried to maintain the original tone (critical and politically engaged). The Erosion of Respect for Public Service: Why Democrats Need to Defend Federal Workers The recent rhetoric from figures like Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy has laid bare a disturbing trend: a growing disdain for the contributions of federal employees. Musk's dismissive characterization of remote work during the pandemic as “pretending” – a statement made despite the vital role federal agencies played in distributing aid and maintaining essential services – is particularly galling. It reveals a lack of empathy and a willingness to denigrate the sacrifices made by those who serve the public. This isn't simply a matter of personality clashes; it's a symptom of a broader societal devaluation of public service, and alarmingly, a trend that some within the democratic party seem willing to tolerate. The Pandemic Highlighted,and Then Undermined,the Value of Federal Work The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically illustrated the importance of a functioning federal government...."

The 31-year-old singer surprise-released a new album, “Swag,” Friday after teasing fans the previous morning with a series of billboards and social media posts. Bieber's first album since 2021's “Justice,” the new music prompted an online frenzy and revived a devoted community of Beliebers. From his marriage to his paparazzi encounters, Bieber has faced incredible scrutiny over the last few months, which he addresses head-on in ""Swag."" After listening to all 21 tracks, here are our biggest takeaways. R&Bieber is back Bieber has incorporated R&B elements in his music since early in his career and embraced the genre fully on the 2013 compilation album “Journals.” But even after coining R&Bieber in 2019, he's struggled to be taken seriously. When 2020's “Changes” received a Grammy nomination for pop vocal album, Bieber expressed his confusion at not being nominated in the R&B category. “To the Grammys I am flattered to be acknowledged and appreciated for my artistry. I am very meticulous and intentional about my music. With that being said I set out to make an R&B album. ' Changes' was and is an R&B album,” he wrote on Instagram. “It is not being acknowledged as an R&B album which is very strange to me. I grew up admiring R&B music and wished to make a project that would embody that sound.” “To be clear I absolutely love Pop music,"" he added. "" It just wasn't what I set out to make this time around. My gratitude for feeling respected for my work remains and I am honored to be nominated either way.” On “Swag,” Bieber shows off his R&B chops. From opening track “All I Can Take” and the seemingly SZA-inspired “Yukon” to “Daisies” (which reportedly features Mk.gee on the guitar), he takes a more intimate approach than on previous albums. But still, longtime fans will hear hints of “Journals” and “Changes” throughout the project. In one of the album's unconventional moments, comedian Druski comments on Bieber's more “soulful,” R&B-infused sound. “I said this album kinda sound, you got some soul on this album too, bro,” he says on the interlude track “Soulful.” “Your skin white but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you, man.” He's not 'Walking Away' from his marriage Since Justin and Hailey Bieber wed in 2018, their marriage has been under a microscope. Divorce rumors circulated within months of them tying the knot, and it didn't help that many fans were still rooting for the singer to get back with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. Bieber's love for his wife is evident throughout his catalog — from 2020's “All Around Me” to 2021's “Hailey.” But in case anyone is still skeptical (they are), Bieber sets the record straight on “Swag.” On album standout “Walking Away,” Bieber gets candid about his relationship troubles but also reaffirms that he's committed to his marriage. “You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,” he sings. Elsewhere on the album, he cheers on his wife. On “Go Baby” (which lyrically echoes 2021's “There She Go”), he sings, “That's my baby, she's iconic, iPhone case, lip gloss on it” — a reference to the Rhode founder's famous lip gloss-holder phone case. Recently, Hailey sold her skin-care company, which she launched in 2022, to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion. There she goes indeed.

mov_7ECDA38D5912AA50CF97482BC2E4EA97,2025-07-12 01:30:00,en,WEB,"  Allstate recently released an updated report highlighting where America's best and worst drivers are by number of collisions using data related to claims in the U.S.'s 200 most-populated cities. The study displays some interesting trends, but these reports can cause drivers to overlook the dangers of rural roads. Statistics suggest that drivers are more likely to be involved in fatal accidents on rural roads than their urban counterparts. In 2023, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) published a report noting that although 20% of U.S. residents live in rural areas and 31% of miles traveled occur in these regions, 41% of crash deaths occur there. Rural counties contain a greater share of land area, with more miles of roads, increasing the opportunities for accidents. Emergency responses can also be longer in rural areas. In 2022, the fatality rate per 100 million vehicle miles traveled was 1.5 times higher in rural areas than in urban areas, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Allstate ranked Boston, Massachusetts, as the city where drivers are most likely to experience a collision, followed by Washington D.C., Baltimore, Maryland, Worcester, Massachusetts, Springfield, Massachusetts, Glendale, California, Los Angeles, California, Oakland, California, Providence, Rhode Island, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While a handful of West Coast cities made this top 10 list, seven out of 10 were located in the Northeast. Brownsville, Texas, was rated as the safest place to drive, but this wasn't the only city in the Lone Star State with a favorable grade. Texas cities Laredo, McAllen, and Corpus Christi also made the top 20. Allstate has been conducting this study annually since 2005, and in the past decade, Texas cities like Austin, Fort Worth, Houston, and Dallas have advanced toward safety. Drivers in Pacific Northwest regions such as Washington, Oregon, and Alaska have seen some of the most significant collision reductions nationwide over the past 10 years. More specifically, Bellevue, Washington, has experienced the most improvement, moving up 133 spots since 2015. Other noteworthy cities include Anchorage, Alaska, and Portland, Oregon. Several Midwestern cities have fallen in Allstate's list over the past decade. St. Louis, Missouri, declined the most, dropping 90 spots to 175, while Des Moines, Iowa, fell 89 places to 108, and Kansas City, Missouri, moved back 84 spots to 101. Other Midwestern cities mirroring this trend are Sioux Falls, South Dakota, Minneapolis, Cleveland, Omaha, Nebraska, and Indianapolis, Indiana. There's a long way between Boston, Massachusetts's spot at 200 and first place with Brownsville, Texas, and this gap is widening, with 75 of the riskiest cities recording a 25% increase in crash rates since 2015. In Boston, drivers are nearly three and a half times more likely to be involved in a collision than the national average. City crash data often grabs headlines, as more people live in urban areas than in rural ones, but this reporting can overshadow the risks associated with the latter. In addition to longer stretches of roadway and slower emergency response times, rural areas have drivers traveling at higher average speeds, and these motorists are less likely to wear seatbelts, according to FinanceBuzz. Single-vehicle crashes are also more common in rural regions, which can involve running off the road or rolling over, increasing fatality risks. Copyright 2025 The Arena Group, Inc.

mov_A2B21548522C9251229F93E9F9271FA5,2025-07-12 04:30:00,en,WEB,"  A conservative-leaning Wyoming nonprofit has filed a lawsuit accusing the New Mexico Department of Justice of violating the state Inspection of Public Records Act. The complaint, filed Thursday in state District Court, claims the department has failed to produce common interest agreements between Democratic attorneys general throughout the country who united in advance of the 2024 presidential election to strategize about legal actions they could take to push back on policies now-President Donald Trump might enact if elected. The plaintiff — called Government Accountability and Oversight, a right-leaning public interest group that describes itself as focused on government transparency — referenced a February article from Politico entitled ""23 Dem AGs think they've cracked the code to fighting Trump"" to help the department identify the records it sought. The story highlights a unified push by Democratic attorneys general to prepare to litigate against policies they collectively opposed. ""A few attorneys general volunteered immediately to start doing research, drafting motions and working on arguments,"" the article said. ""They took broad issue categories back to their individual states — immigration, reproductive health, the environment, voting rights — and laid out the criteria they would use to distribute assignments throughout the year: Who has bandwidth? Who has expertise? Who is being harmed?"" New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez is not among the attorneys general quoted in the story. But the article does highlight New Mexico's role in the multistate litigation opposing the Department of Government Efficiency that arose from the collective effort, noting while one group of state attorneys general filed a suit accusing DOGE of violating citizens' privacy, another group led by New Mexico ""went after [Elon] Musk himself, for wielding too much power for someone who was never confirmed by the Senate."" Based on documents released by other public offices, there are at least 70 agreements of the type sought in the group's records request. But the state Department of Justice only produced five of them in response to the March request, according to the lawsuit, which seeks a court order forcing the department to release the records as well as damages allowed by the Inspection of Public Records Act and legal costs. The Inspection of Public Records Act allows for damages of up to $100 per day, and the group filed its request March 3, according to the lawsuit. ""We are aware of the lawsuit but have not yet been formally served. Once that happens, we will review the claims carefully and respond appropriately,"" Department of Justice Chief of Staff Lauren Rodriguez wrote in an email Friday. Government Accountability and Oversight didn't respond to an email seeking an interview but did share four of the common interest agreements it obtained through the request. In a common interest agreement, the parties agree to confidentially share information, documents and communications related to common interests in pursuing litigation on the issues. The records shared by the group include: An agreement with an effective date of Jan. 3, 2024, and signed by Torrez on Nov. 13, 2024, in which the parties agree they have a common interest in ""in developing legal strategies to challenge the actions and formation of the Department of Government Efficiency,"" and in ""any existing or future executive, legislative, regulatory, and investigative actions or inactions and any administrative or judicial proceedings related to or arising from DOGE recommendations."" An agreement among the states of New Mexico, Arizona, Michigan, California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington and the State Democracy Defenders Fund, signed Feb. 18 by New Mexico Chief Deputy Attorney General James W. Grayson, in which the parties agree they have a common interest in ""developing legal strategies to challenge the creation and actions of the Department of Government Efficiency ... and the actions of Elon Musk as a special government employee."" An agreement with an effective date of Nov. 14, 2024, signed by Torrez on Nov. 13, in which the parties agree they have a common interest in ""developing potential litigation to challenge executive action related to ending or curtailing birthright citizenship."" An agreement with an effective date of Jan. 9, 2025, in which the parties agree they have a common interest in ""developing potential work product, litigation and/or amicus briefing against the use of Alien Enemies Act ... by the federal government to unlawfully detain and deport individuals or groups from the United States."""

The album, which contains 21 songs, has found success online, with netizens praising the Peaches singer for his latest creation. In one of the songs on his album, Bieber also addresses the ""It's not clocking to you"" meme, which went viral last month. Standing on Business - the 16th track on SWAG - includes the audio pulled from the viral video, where the singer tells a paparazzi: After releasing the album, Justin Bieber used the viral phrase on a promo billboard and shared it on X. The post quickly went viral, with over 33 million views, 45K retweets, 14K saves, and 489K likes. According to Cosmopolitan, the album Standing on Business also stands out for featuring comedian Druski. On the track, the comedian delivers a 50-second interlude, saying, Before the album dropped, Justin's wife, Hailey Bieber, also referenced the viral meme when she shared an Instagram story featuring one of SWAG's billboards. The Rhode founder wrote under the post: Aside from showing support for her husband's latest project, Hailey Bieber also makes an appearance in one of SWAG's cover arts, with one of them featuring a family portrait of the couple with their 11-month-old son, Jack Blues Bieber.

This news came amid the release of the pop singer's seventh studio album, , on July 11, 2025. On July 10, 2025, TMZ reported that Bieber and Braun reached a $31.5 million settlement regarding their financial dispute. News of Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun reportedly settling their financial dispute was met with mixed reactions from netizens on X, with one user accusing the former manager of robbing Bieber. ""So scooter robbed justin, disgusting, karma is coming."" liv @grandesnasaso scooter robbed justin, disgusting, karma is coming Several netizens agreed with this sentiment, claiming Braun was a ""fake friend"" to Bieber. ""That person should change their name to scooter robber,"" one person tweeted. ""All my homies hate scooter braun,"" another person added. ""That's when you know there are no friends in the music business…Braun always acted like he was Justin's friend and cared for him…but once it affected his pockets all that fake friendship went out the window… and we all saw the medical issues that made Justin cancel the tour,"" someone else commented. ""Scooter deserves no more money after this,"" another user said. Others speculated whether the pop star's wife, Hailey Bieber, was instrumental in settling the debt. For context, Hailey sold her beauty brand, Rhode, to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion in late May 2025. ""Hailey helped him pay the debt by selling her company,"" one person speculated. ""I bet that was Hailey's Rhode money,"" another person added. ""That rhode money is gonna last nothing at this point,"" someone else commented. ""Hence the lovely posts with wifey! Women always save the day smh,"" another user wrote. Exploring Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun's financial dispute The financial dispute between Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun began in 2022, while the singer was on his ""Justice Tour"" to promote his sixth studio album. For the uninitiated, Bieber reportedly received a $40 million advance from Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), which is Live Nation's parent company, for his ""Justice Tour"" in 2022. However, the singer canceled most of the tour in 2023 due to a health condition (he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome) and was asked to pay back $26 million of the advance to AEG. According to TMZ, Scooter Braun, who was Bieber's manager at the time, shouldered the payment through his company Hybe, with the pop star promising to pay Hybe and Braun back in installments over the next 10 years. Justin Bieber reportedly paid just one installment and stopped. However, recent reports indicate that Bieber and Braun have settled the payment, which also included an additional clause requiring Bieber to pay half of the $11 million that he allegedly owed Braun in unpaid commissions, bringing the total to $31.5 million. As per the TMZ report, this does not include the additional $8.6 million that Bieber allegedly owed Braun in further unpaid commissions, which the former manager waived. There have been multiple reports of Justin Bieber's alleged financial struggles, which many believe contributed to the singer selling his 291-song catalogue to Hipgnosis Songs Capital in December 2022 for $200 million. A TMZ documentary released in May 2025, titled alleged that the singer “had to sell his music catalog because he was broke.” “I was on a call with multiple people — Justin's side acknowledges that in 2022, he was on the verge of… the words were 'financial collapse.' And that's why he had to sell his catalog,” TMZ executive producer Levin says in the documentary. However, Justin Bieber has denied all rumors of his alleged financial troubles, with his representative telling The Hollywood Reporter in April 2025: “Any source that is trying to sell you a story about alleged financial distress … either doesn't understand the entertainment industry or, more likely, is trying to paint an unflattering portrait of Justin, which bears no resemblance to reality.” As per Celebrity Net Worth, Justin Bieber's net worth is reportedly $200 million as of July 2025. In other news, Justin Bieber surprised fans after he released his new album, , on July 11 with minimal promotion. The 21-track album reportedly features artists like Cash Cobain, Gunna, and Druski.

It's been a steep learning curve for Jonny, but one he has taken on like a veteran reporter. During the past year he's chronicled the shortages of , and and explored the . Really, he's just getting started. Earlier this year, Jonny was selected as a . The selection meant two days in Los Angeles, where he got to work on his craft and hear from fellow reporters in the field. He's already gotten some story ideas from it. We asked Jonny to tell us a little about the experience. You were named a 2025 Health Journalism Fellow through the Association of Health Care Journalists. Why were you interested in this opportunity? I was looking for opportunities to connect with other health care journalists, learn from how they approach the beat and get story ideas. I also wanted more professional development, as health care journalism – and particularly the business of health care – poses a steep learning curve. What did you find most interesting about the fellowship? There were several workshops and sessions that were particularly helpful. A few explored the finances of hospitals and health systems, which can be quite opaque and hard to report on. There was also an excellent workshop on writing tips, and another on how artificial intelligence is being adopted into health care services, which was both fascinating and unsettling at the same time. Finally, I got the chance to network with both other health care reporters from Rhode Island and from other states. It was encouraging hearing from their experience covering the beat, getting tips and sharing stories we've written with each other. How do you envision the fellowship building on your reporting of Rhode Island's health care issues? I am hoping that the workshops on the finances of health systems will help yield some stories on that topic, particularly as we are seeing our hospitals both growing and struggling at the same time. Hospitals have a growing footprint in the state, are often some of the largest employers in the community and are a crucial part of the rising cost of health care in the country, so understanding will help us get a better sense of the state of health care in Rhode Island. The fellowship program took place in Los Angeles. Were you able to enjoy any time outside of the program?

mov_B8D0060F70B909590F4728EAB69452A4,2025-07-12 12:00:00,en,WEB,"  Nicholas Litchfield Author Interview    Hessman's Necklace is a gritty noir thriller set in 1950s America, where a reckless fixer hunts a legendary necklace through a smoky maze of lust, lies, and moral ruin. What was the inspiration for the setup of your story? I was reading a lot of crime stories from the period when I first began Hessman's Necklace, adhering to the conventions of noir. I focused on seedy settings, grim circumstances, and deeply flawed characters with dubious pasts and unsavory motivations. The very first scene I penned was a visceral torture sequence, featuring Ray wielding a blade while the Reverend, bound to a harsh wooden chair, pleaded for his life, fervently asserting his innocence. Initially conceived as a short story, it was rejected by a magazine due to its graphic and violent nature. Through numerous revisions, I softened the scene to make it more palatable. Eventually, I expanded it from a short story into a novelette, and then into a full-fledged novel, yet that pivotal scene continued to serve as the heart of the book. It encapsulates a moment where the central character, Ray, is pushed to the brink of barbarity as pressure and ambition drive him further into darkness. The prose in Hessman's Necklace is bold and stylized. How did you develop that voice? I drew inspiration from the works of writers such as Dashiell Hammett, John D. MacDonald, and F. Scott Fitzgerald. Hammett, in particular, possessed a remarkable talent for crafting memorable characters, each defined by their actions, appearance, and dialogue. In Hessman's Necklace, my intention was to honor this style by bringing my characters to life through their distinct voices and the authenticity of their interactions. Like Hammett's dialogue, which flows organically, I aimed to make my characters' exchanges engaging and meaningful, propelling the narrative forward while revealing their complexities and motivations. John D. MacDonald's mastery of detail and sensory richness played a crucial role in shaping my narrative choices. I carefully wove my characters into gritty environments, ensuring that readers could not only follow the unfolding drama but also feel the weight of their surroundings. I embraced sharp, raw language to convey tension and captured the visceral sensations of key moments. At the same time, I drew from Fitzgerald's lyrical prose, employing vivid imagery and striking metaphors to enhance the depth of the narrative. The book leans into noir tropes but still feels fresh. How did you strike that balance between homage and originality? I've always had a fondness for the 1950s noir and crime fiction paperback originals from publishers like Gold Medal Books, as well as others such as Signet, Dell, Lion, and Ace. While many of these works adhere closely to established formulas, the sheer demand and profitability urged writers to produce quickly. It's impressive how prolific authors like Erle Stanley Gardner maintained quality while churning out massive quantities; he produced twenty-eight novels in a single decade. Gil Brewer could wrap up an entire novel in mere days: So Rich, So Dead was completed in just five days, while Flight to Darkness took only three. I aimed to create a 1950s-style noir with a more deliberate approach and a creative twist on conventions. I challenged myself to tell the story from Ray's perspective, ensuring he was present in every scene, and sought to add a literary flair that elevated the prose without slipping into artificiality or pretentiousness. Underrated crime writer John Flagg, whose novel The Persian Cat was the inaugural release from Gold Medal, excels at high drama—his stories are typically enriched by thrilling scenes, well-imagined locations, and engaging characters. His lush descriptions and sharply sarcastic personas inspired me to keep Hessman's Necklace both fast-paced and suspenseful while emphasizing wit. I incorporated factual historical details, references to topical news, literature, and art world trivia to capture the essence of that period, all while addressing modern themes that echoed those times. Alas, unlike Gardner and Brewer, it took me years rather than days to finally consider the story complete. What is the next book that you are working on, and when will it be available? I've started and paused half a dozen novels since finishing Hessman's Necklace. There's always a deadline looming that sidelines my creative writing projects, making it a real challenge to find the motivation to complete one before moving on to the next. But I'm determined to get there. Currently, I'm polishing the final chapters of a family drama set in Rhode Island. It leans more towards a beach novel than a crime story, infused with plenty of humor, tension, and personal struggles. Once that's wrapped up, I plan to revisit the office-based mystery I began last year, and with any luck, both of these novels will finally be ready for publication by early next year.

Handsomely paid for the past five years, Ray has become one of Walter's most trusted employees, depended on to steal coveted treasures from the homes of private collectors. Ray's captivating looks and distinction as a ladies' man persuade Walter to assign him the unusual task of getting romantically close to Merriam Woolcroft, a pretty church secretary. Apparently, Merriam is the mistress of Reverend Arnold Sinclair, a shady South Boston clergyman whose community activities have identified him as a powerful trafficker of stolen antiques. Although mildly curious if Sinclair's vestry is stocked with priceless art, one solitary object occupies Walter's interest: a famed emerald-studded 22-karat gold necklace purloined from a museum thirty years earlier. Convinced that the reverend has this long-lost relic, Walter maintains that Ray should focus on stealing Merriam's heart to locate the necklace, unaware that manipulating a woman is far more complex and dangerous than manipulating locks. Escalating tension and unexpected twists turn the stealthy treasure hunt into a ruthless fight for survival."

Those are some of the superlatives that friends and colleagues used to describe Vin Di Bona during a tribute to the veteran “America's Funniest Home Videos” executive producer hosted by Hollywood Media Professionals. Di Bona was hailed for his long run with Vin Di Bona Productions and his extensive efforts to train the next generation through his work as an instructor and member of the board of trustees of Emerson College, his alma mater. After starting his career as a pop singer in his native Rhode Island, Di Bona segued into TV production, working for local TV stations such as WBZ-TV Boston and later, KCBS-TV Los Angeles. Former “Entertainment Tonight” host Mary Hart thanked Di Bona for “going to bat for me” in 1982 when she auditioned for a groundbreaking newsmagazine show that he was helping to produce called “Entertainment Tonight.” Popular on Variety The presentation of Hollywood Media Professionals Honors' kudo was held June 28 on the Manhattan Beach soundstage where Di Bona steers “AFV,” ABC's enduring family favorite. The dais of speakers included “AFV” host Alfonso Ribeiro, Rob Mills, executive VP of unscripted and alternative entertainment for Walt Disney TV; and Alyson Hannigan, co-host with Ribeiro of the Di Bona-produced ABC special “America's Funniest People.” Also weighing in was veteran producer Gary Grossman, who is working with Di Bona on his autobiography, and John Goldhammer, who toiled closely with Di Bona on “Entertainment Tonight,” and Hollywood Media Professionals president Chuck Street. A number of notables sent recorded remarks, including Hart, former “AFV” host Tom Bergeron, Henry Winkler, Dave Coulier, Jay Leno, Leeza Gibbons and Eva LaRue. The event was produced by industry veteran E.V. Di Massa Jr., a longtime colleague of Di Bona. Emcee Michael Burger shared personal stories of working with Di Bona. He credited the busy producer for discovering him while Burger was working as a cruise ship comic. “I was a stand up comic telling jokes on a cruise ship, and he plucked me out of the ocean, dragged me off and gave me my first break,” Burger recalled. Di Bona was praised for his instincts in casting talent, producers and other creatives on his many series over the years. Ribeiro, the former “Fresh Prince of Bel-Air” star, credited Di Bona with having faith in him to take the helm of “AFV” host after Tom Bergeron bowed out of the role in 2015. Ribeiro was known as a comic actor — he didn't have much hosting experience. “I told Vin I spent my whole life trying to get people to know my name is Alfonso, not Carlton,” Ribeiro said, citing his “Fresh Prince” character who was known for his distinctive dance. “He said something so wise, and it applies to any host. He goes, 'It's not about you. Show interest in someone else, and you've injected them with the drug so powerful they'll want to come back for more.' And 11 seasons later, I think he spoke the truth,” Ribeiro said. Hannigan, a newer recruit to the Di Bona troupe, noted that the producer's innate kindness and consideration impressed her from the start. Di Bona's penchant for being a natty dresser was also mentioned more than once. She recalled her first meeting with Di Bona for the crowd. “I'm waiting in the lobby, and expecting to see many people before I meet him. And the door opens, and there's Vin himself greeting me,” Hannigan recalled. “And he was in a fabulous suit, obviously, and he just walked me through and told me a wonderful story about this vintage television that was just so heartwarming. And I was immediately struck by – 'Oh, why isn't everybody in the business this man?' “ Disney TV honcho Mills told the SRO crowd that he learned so much from working with Di Bona early in his career at ABC. “I call work on this TV executive fantasy camp – it's amazing. This is one of the shows where you can say, 'I watched this show my entire life and now I can be lucky enough to work alongside these people,' “ Mills enthused. After more than an hour of superlatives, Di Bona took the podium to express his overwhelming gratitude and appreciation. He shared a long anecdote about the high-wire act of producing the 1987 TV special that was beamed live around the world during Pope John Paul II's visit to the United States. Di Bona closed by citing the importance of the strong professional and personal bonds he's made along the way after more than 50 years in television. “There's so much love in this room and kindness and friendship,” Di Bona said. “I thank you.”"

Buyers will discover essential insights to determine if Gunner Gear is a safe and legitimate stun gun for modern personal protection. The Current Self-Defense Landscape in 2025 Rising Crime Statistics Fuel Personal Protection Demand Why Stun Guns Are Trending in 2025's Personal Safety Market The U.S. personal safety market is booming in 2025, largely due to rising crime rates and growing consumer interest in non-lethal self-defense tools like stun guns. FBI data shows assault rates jumped from 2.85 per 1,000 people in 2022 to 3.15 in 2023, with projections pointing even higher. Urban and suburban areas alike are fueling demand for compact, effective, and legally accessible protection gear. This statistical increase translates to real-world implications for millions of Americans who now face heightened risks in their daily activities. Urban areas have reported the most significant spikes in violent crime, but suburban and rural communities have also witnessed increases in property crimes and personal attacks. The combination of these factors has created a perfect storm of demand for accessible, effective, and legal self-defense solutions. Why Stun Guns Lead the Self-Defense Market Among the various personal protection options available to consumers, stun guns have emerged as the preferred choice for several compelling reasons. Unlike firearms, which require extensive licensing, training, and legal restrictions in many jurisdictions, stun guns offer a non-lethal alternative that can effectively disable an attacker without causing permanent harm. The psychological advantage of carrying a stun gun cannot be understated. The distinctive electrical arc sound and visible sparks serve as powerful deterrents, often preventing confrontations from escalating to physical violence. This preventive aspect makes stun guns particularly attractive to individuals who want protection but prefer to avoid potentially lethal encounters. Market Evolution and Consumer Preferences The stun gun industry has undergone significant evolution in recent years, moving away from bulky, single-purpose devices toward compact, multi-functional units that integrate seamlessly into daily life. Modern consumers demand devices that offer more than just electrical protection-they want tools that provide additional utility without compromising effectiveness. Current market research indicates that buyers prioritize several key features when selecting personal protection devices. Portability ranks highest among consumer preferences, with most buyers seeking devices that can be easily carried in purses, pockets, or attached to keychains. Voltage capacity remains a critical consideration, though experts note that higher voltage doesn't necessarily guarantee superior stopping power due to factors like amperage and contact duration. The Integration Challenge One of the most significant challenges facing stun gun manufacturers in 2025 is helping consumers integrate these devices into their daily routines effectively. Unlike pepper spray, which requires minimal training, stun guns demand proper handling techniques, regular maintenance, and psychological preparation for use in high-stress situations. This integration challenge has led to increased focus on user-friendly design features, comprehensive instruction materials, and customer support systems that help buyers transition from purchase to confident usage. Companies that successfully address these concerns are finding greater customer satisfaction and loyalty in an increasingly competitive market. Legal Landscape and Compliance The legal framework surrounding stun gun ownership and use continues to evolve across different jurisdictions. While most states permit stun gun ownership for self-defense purposes, specific regulations vary significantly. Rhode Island maintains a complete ban on civilian stun gun ownership, while states like Connecticut and Florida require licensing for possession. Understanding these legal requirements has become crucial for manufacturers and consumers alike. Companies must navigate complex compliance issues when marketing and shipping products across state lines, while buyers must ensure they understand their local laws before making purchases. This legal complexity has contributed to the rise of educational resources and compliance tools within the industry. Market Projections and Future Trends Industry analysts project continued growth in the personal protection market throughout 2025, driven by sustained crime concerns and increasing awareness of non-lethal self-defense options. The integration of smart technology, improved battery life, and enhanced safety features are expected to drive innovation and consumer adoption in the coming months. The emergence of hybrid devices that combine stun gun functionality with everyday items like flashlights, cell phone chargers, and personal alarms represents a significant trend that addresses consumer desires for discretion and multi-functionality...."

Golfweek's Best 2025 list of top private courses included selections of between 4-20 courses in each state, which were rated by a panel of hundreds based on 10 criteria: routing, integrity of design/quality of shaping, overall land plan, greens and surrounds, variety and memorability of par 3s, 4s and 5s, tree and landscape management, conditioning and ecology and a ""walk in the park"" test — if it's worthy of spending four hours on. Each course also received a single, overall rating from each panel member, which were then averaged to produce all of Golfweek's best course rankings. Here's what to know.

This could work in regard to Mormonism, as I have considered while reading Richard Lyman Bushman's biography of the religion's founder, <em>Joseph Smith: Rough Stone Rolling</em>, widely considered among both Mormons and non-Mormons to be the best biography of Smith from the last few decades. As someone with a <a href=""https://awalledbutwindyroom.wordpress.com/2020/10/10/mapping-ghost-country/"">passion</a> for maps and patriotism for my country of the United States, I can see part of Mormonism's appeal; by presenting Native Americans as descendants of an Israelite family who carried God's word into this hemisphere and experienced him here, the <em>Book of Mormon</em> overlays my beloved landscape with biblical meaning, <a href=""https://awalledbutwindyroom.wordpress.com/2022/07/04/an-american-camino/"">supercharges</a> my homeland with the supernatural. Bushman sums up the intended effect on Americans' perception of their country: “In the <em>Book of Mormon</em>, the biblical overwhelms the national.” Yet I think Catholicism can have a similar but more profound effect, particularly through Our Lady of Guadalupe. In 1531, the indigenous Mexican convert Juan Diego encountered apparitions of the Virgin Mary in Guadalupe (apparitions that, like any other supernatural occurrences postdating the apostolic age, are not mandatory belief for all Catholics, but that are nevertheless <a href=""https://awalledbutwindyroom.wordpress.com/2023/12/27/of-science-fiction-dreams-and-our-lady-of-guadalupes-historicity/"">well-attested</a>). As Bushman presents the <em>Book of Mormon</em> to be “an extension of the Old and New Testaments to the Western Hemisphere,” Mary's apparitions in Guadalupe served as an extension of the biblical story to the New World, hence the mass conversions in Mexico right afterward. The Catholic Church therefore calls Our Lady of Guadalupe the Patroness of the Americas. Here, then, we can see Our Lady of Guadalupe to be the mirror image of Mormonism. Furthering the similarity is the fact that both seem intended in part as responses to Protestantism. Amidst Protestant denominations <a href=""https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=9872"">fragmenting</a> over different interpretations of Scripture—lacking an authoritative interpreter on earth—Smith's mother in her pre-Mormon days lamented, “If I remain a member of no church, all religious people will say I am of the world; and if I join some one of the different denominations, all the rest will say I am in error.” Bushman explains, “She concluded 'that there was not then upon the earth the religion' she sought.” It is thus no surprise that her son Joseph came to believe all the denominations “teach for doctrines the commandments of men.” Mormonism arose as the solution for him and his mother, purportedly providing revelations straight from heaven. Catholics, who do have an interpretive authority in the <a href=""https://awalledbutwindyroom.wordpress.com/2024/07/26/when-saint-paul-submitted-to-the-pope/"">Magisterium</a>, likewise claim heaven-sent affirmation in response to Protestantism: Our Lady of Guadalupe's apparitions, which occurred shortly after the start of the Protestant Reformation. The former Protestant Casey Chalk <a href=""https://www.catholicworldreport.com/2024/01/14/new-book-fails-to-explain-why-protestants-convert-to-catholicism/"">notes</a>, “[I]f the Reformation was such a significant, divinely-authorized event in salvation history, why (as so many counter-Reformation apologists asked) did no miracles attend it? … In sharp, glaring contrast, widely recognized miracles continue to confirm the Catholic Church is precisely who she says she is. I've had the great privilege to visit where one of those miracles took place: Tepeyac, Mexico City, where Mary appeared to an Aztec peasant almost five-hundred years ago. Visitors can still see the tilma of Juan Diego bearing the image of Our Lady [i.e. his cactus-fiber cloak on which her likeness was miraculously imprinted].” This spotlighting of the indigenous is another similarity between Mormonism and Our Lady of Guadalupe. Based on the <em>Book of Mormon</em>'s depiction of Native Americans as Israelites, God's chosen people, Bushman observes, “The <em>Book of Mormon</em> is not just sympathetic to Indians; it grants them dominance—in history, in God's esteem, and in future ownership of the American continent.” Likewise, in the story of Our Lady of Guadalupe, it was not the long-Catholic Spaniards who succeeded in spreading the Gospel throughout Mexico. Their missionaries had, in fact, mainly encountered resistance prior to the apparitions. Rather, it was an indigenous convert acting as a messenger of his heavenly mother, Juan Diego, who ended up being the most effective evangelist. I therefore appreciate how Frank La Rocca, in his <em>Mass of the Americas</em>, sets a <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6gcBT3sNuQ&list=PLgth7UAnTn5_zIp4s0AXQjDshFn35qdRI&index=8"">haunting hymn</a> of the Hail Mary in the Aztec language and a non-European scale. Finally, both Mormonism and Our Lady of Guadalupe claim standing miracles: the <em>Book of Mormon</em> and Juan Diego's tilma, respectively. In composing the <em>Book of Mormon</em>, Joseph Smith purportedly used supernatural stones hidden in a hat to translate ancient metal plates he said an angel had located for him, and others transcribed the words he uttered while he was peering into the hat. One transcriber working right beside him, his wife, Emma, later testified, “He had neither manuscripts nor book to read from. If he had had anything of the kind he could not have concealed it from me. The plates often lay on the table without any attempt at concealment, wrapped in a small linen table cloth, which I had given him to fold them in. I felt of the plates, as they lay on the table, tracing their outline and shape. They seemed to be pliable like thick paper, and would rustle with a metallic sound when the edges were moved by the thumb…. Joseph Smith could neither write nor dictate a coherent and well-worded letter, let alone dictating a book like the <em>Book of Mormon</em>.” Personally, I am not convinced. Among many other reasons, there seems to be ambiguity about whether witnesses saw the plates directly, and whether the number of plates could contain the number of words in the <em>Book of Mormon</em>. I will not examine such arguments here; they are better explored in Catholic apologist Jimmy Akin's <em>Mysterious World</em> <a href=""https://sqpn.com/2019/07/joseph-smith-mormon-prophet/"">episode</a> on Joseph Smith, and in Catholic apologist Trent Horn's <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9V_N0cRqzQU"">debate</a> with Mormon apologist Jacob Hansen.

Concerning the tilma itself, the same anthology quotes the painter Miguel Cabrera's 1756 statement, “From all that can be ascertained, in this loveliest portrait of Our Sovereign Lady of Guadalupe, the head and hands were executed in oils, the tunic and the angel and the clouds which frame it were done in tempera, the mantle was done in water-color, and the background in fresco. These media are so distinct in their workmanship that each one requires its special sizing and solvent; and since none has anything in common…this makes it all the more miraculous and unforeseen a combination—especially since it has all been executed on a single surface. For me this is an overwhelming persuasion to the prodigious painting's being supernatural.” The Proceedings of 1666, moreover, assembled eight painters widely considered experts in the field, who also swore they could not find a natural explanation for the image's composition. Thus, similarly extending a biblical storyline to the Americas, responding to Protestantism, spotlighting indigenous contributions to salvation history, and claiming standing miracles, Mormonism and Our Lady of Guadalupe prove to be mirror images of each..."

President Donald Trump's tariffs threaten to exacerbate the situation with several key grocery items expected to increase as tariffs fall into place. So where can shoppers go for to find the cheapest grocery prices? Financial website NetCredit.com performed a study looking at the cheapest grocery stores in all 50 states, as well as many American cities. The site found that Target and Walmart are the most affordable supermarkets in 23 states — but not Massachusetts. That title went to Price Rite, which the study found had grocery prices approximately 20% cheaper than the state average. Price Rite was also the cheapest grocery chain in neighboring New Hampshire and Rhode Island, the study found. Walmart was the cheapest in New York and Connecticut, Target was the cheapest in Maine, and Tops Markets was the cheapest in Vermont. NetCredit analyzed prices at over 2,000 grocery stores, looking at 136 supermarket chains, according to the study. The organization made a list of grocery items from major brands and used instacart.com to find the prices of the items across stores in the biggest zip codes of the most populous cities across America. They compared the average price per item at each chain in each state and compared it against the state average. Here are the study's top 5 cheapest Massachusetts grocery stores: Price Rite — 20% cheaper than state average Target — 13% cheaper than state average Hannaford Supermarket — 7% cheaper than state average Wegmans — 7% cheaper than state average Big Y World Class Market — 5% cheaper than state average You can read the full study here.

They're treated roughly as badly as Infected, which they usually are as well as a consequence of where they're forced to live. >Ines is not Sarkaz, but is a horned race, and forced her horns to look Sarkazian for reasons? She's a Caprinae. If I recall correctly, her reasons were that she's an Infected and a mercenary, so if she's going to be treated like garbage everywhere she goes, she should at least pretend to be part of a group were there are some benefits to go along with being treated like garbage. >Her powers also have something to do with viewing intentions of people by looking at their shadows? Think of this aspect of her Arts as a variant of Aura reading in most fantasies/xianxias, and you've got the jist. It can do a bit more than reading intentions, but it does depend on her ability to reliably understand what it is she's seeing. >Also I'm not entirely clear on all the relationships between people like Scout, W, and Hoerder, near the latter half of this episode other than they're all Sarkaz? All of Rhodes Islands old Elite Operators (including Scout and Ace) were part of Babel, and W, Innes, and Hoederer had left on good terms with them. They found themselves on different sides during the Chernobog conflict, but they didn't *want* to kill their old friends - it was just the same recurring tragedy that Hoederer laid out at the start of the episode. (But to detail it a bit more precisely; Garcin had Theresis's trust, and was there to ensure the other Sarkaz remained aligned with Theresis's agenda. W was building up her own faction amongst the mercs, and needed Garcin dead to avoid complications. She reached out to her old buddy Scout to make it happen, who had a request of his own; that she *not* immediately murder the Doctor, and in fact help the recovery team make it out. Setting aside W's history, this was a big ask of its own - putting a hole in Reunion's encirclement meant flubbing a big job in a visible way, even if Reunion didn't particularly care about Rhodes Island before this. To sell this as not obvious betrayal, W would need an excuse to explain the failure - and Scout and his team interfering with the plan in a high-profile way would justify why the encirclement failed. But said plan would also need Scout and his team to die... A sacrifice Scout was willing to make, if it would ensure the Doctor's return. A future he himself didn't want to see to begin with - he knew it was necessary for Rhode's Island future, but he also remembered how bad things had gotten by the end, and had no desire to live through those days a second time. The Plan mostly worked out, but unfortunately, Reunion wasn't quite what they had expected, and there were multiple witnesses to suspicious activity on the part of the Sarkaz mercenaries - something that culminated in Innes's death, and Hoederer returning to Theresis's court in Victoria to massage the story in a way that would ensure the independence of W's mercenaries.)"

Federal authorities have confirmed that more than 300 illegal aliens were arrested Thursday during an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raid at a Ventura County, California cannabis farm. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem confirmed on X that 319 unlawful immigrants were apprehended during the raid at Glass House Farms, and said that “law enforcement rescued 14 children from potential forced labor, exploitation, and trafficking.” The raid is believed to be the second-largest single-state ICE worksite operation in history, behind the first Trump administration's 2019 Mississippi chicken plant raids that netted almost 700 illegal alien arrests.

tw_sl_094f31746efc8d2aad173912af3c0481,2025-07-13 06:33:04,en,WEB,"  In Oklahoma, more than 14,000 truancy charges were filed during the 2021-22 school year. That staggering number made truancy the eighth most charged misdemeanor statewide. This is a sobering reflection of how we handle school attendance problems: not with support but with prosecution. We are aware of the consequences of chronic absenteeism. Students who miss more than 10% of the school year face an uphill battle academically and socially. Research shows that these students are more likely to struggle with reading and math, drop out of high school, and forgo college. The impacts don't end there; long-term impacts of school attendance problems follow students into adulthood, resulting in reduced job prospects and limited economic mobility. Despite this well-researched, well-documented crisis, Oklahoma's response remains disjointed and punitive. While state law recognizes absenteeism as a serious issue, enforcement varies wildly from county to county. In fact, some counties in our state have stopped holding truancy court altogether. Meanwhile, thousands of families elsewhere in the state face court dates, fines or even jail time. This inconsistent and reactive approach isn't only ineffective but also potentially harmful. It places blame and pressure on families without addressing the root causes of absenteeism, which are often tied to poverty, mental health, transportation challenges or caregiving responsibilities. In some cases, the child may be experiencing bullying or other trauma at school. Fines and court dates don't solve these issues. Listen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | Stitcher | RSS Feed | SoundStack | All Of Our Podcasts It's time for Oklahoma to change course. In an attempt to advocate for the future of Oklahoma, our children, I propose it is time to amend our state's attendance laws to require school districts to implement multi-tiered systems of support for students who are chronically absent. These interventions would start with positive, supportive strategies, like personalized outreach to families, access to academic support and transportation solutions. Only when these efforts have been exhausted should legal action be considered. Oklahoma would not be fighting this battle alone. Many states like Rhode Island and New Mexico have already taken legislative steps in this direction, emphasizing collaborative, data-driven approaches. Georgia is even using targeted strategies to address school attendance problems based on the causes of absenteeism in their communities. The result? Measurable attendance gains. The research is clear: When schools, parents, local organizations and state agencies work together, they can re-engage students and reduce absenteeism. The path forward isn't always easy, but our children are worth it. We must update state law to reflect what we now understand about chronic absenteeism; it's not just a legal issue, it's a systemic one. A school cannot educate a child who isn't there, and a courtroom cannot fix what a resource, a counselor or a mentor might. It is time for Oklahoma to stop criminalizing poverty, trauma and disconnection. Let's build a system that meets students and families where they are, listens to their needs and works with them to create solutions. Legal action should be the last tool we use, not the first. And when legal intervention is necessary, it should be consistently accessible, regardless of the county. Oklahoma's future depends on the success of its students. Ensuring they show up to school is just the beginning. We do not want Oklahoma's children to merely survive their educational experience. We want them to thrive."
1lymp6c,2025-07-13 07:15:25,en,REDDIT,"  Location: Rhode Island. Seeking legal advice after an incident occurred with my younger sibling. I'm not entirely sure what to include, so I'll do my best to summarize. My brother and his ex-girlfriend were in a relationship for two years which abruptly turned sour. She threatened to kill herself if he broke up with her, so the relationship continued and in turn obviously continued to decline. When the relationship finally ended, girlfriend, with a large social media following, took to social media to insult and accuse brother of emotional abuse and posted their private text conversations (only those that portrayed him in a negative light, while I have seen her messages from my brothers phone which she conveniently left out). Both are young (early 20's) and this all seems juvenile enough, however, her posts about him gained traction and some even went viral due to her social media presence/one sided story. Complete strangers were doing everything from accusing him of being toxic, insulting his appearance, making accusations and sharing the video, etc. It was truly horrific to witness. This ended up causing a paranoid psychotic break in my brother. I'm not sure what else may have contributed or if there had been underlying symptoms before, but he is a completely different person now. He was always very kind, outgoing, motivated, fun and responsible. After this transpired, there has been social decline, he's angry all the time, he isolates himself, hardly sleeps, and is incredibly suspicious and paranoid of everyone, including family. After watching this happen for over a year we are thinking he may have Schizophrenia or a similar diagnosis. My question is- Can she be held responsible for the things she said about him and posted online (text messages/accusations)? This happened about 2 years ago, but my family is watching his decline and I'm just so angry that I lose sleep at night knowing she may have contributed to this and walks through life pretending to be an angel with no repercussions while my brother is suffering so deeply. Again, I have no idea how much of this is necessary or helpful to the story in order to get advice. I know what's done is done, I'm just trying to help my brother and family in any way that I can at this point. I just ask that people please be kind as this has been an incredibly painful situation."

On 12th (local time), Justin shared Hailey's lemon print bikini photo on his Instagram story, leaving a short but intense reaction: ""F–kkkkkkkkkkkk."" In the photo, Hailey was seen preparing to promote a new product from her skincare brand 'Rhode' on the beach of Mallorca, Spain. Recently, Hailey attracted attention by showcasing a 'lemon-tini mood' styling with a custom Emilio Pucci bikini paired with a crop top and pants through her Instagram. Jet ski shots taken at the same location were also revealed, continuing the couple's vacation certification. However, Justin's reaction was not limited to sweetness. The new album 'Swag,' which was surprisingly released on the same day, contains many lyrics hinting at cracks in his married life. In one of the title tracks, 'Walking Away,' he sings the line, ""She threw stones behind my back / I was defenseless,"" along with, ""Maybe it's better if we stay apart / Since we're just testing our patience."" Furthermore, the lyrics, ""I'm not leaving / I gave you a ring, made a promise, and said I would change / I'm just human... it's just growing pains,"" are interpreted as a reflection on their married life. In another track, 'Go Baby,' he refers to his wife Hailey as 'iconic,' describing her as ""a lip gloss-holding iPhone case,"" thus expressing everyday aspects in his lyrics. He continues with a heartfelt message, saying, ""You can lean on my shoulder / Stay by my side."" This album was released through Def Jam, and the day before the album's release, Justin also shared a family photo with his wife Hailey and their 10-month-old son Jack Blues on social media, generating more buzz. Album promotion continued with large billboards installed in major cities like LA, and Hailey also supported her husband by sharing related photos on her Instagram story. In particular, Hailey added a strong phrase above the billboard photo saying, ""Do you get it now? Fxxking losers,"" expressing her displeasure with recent paparazzi reports. [Photo] SNS [OSEN]"

The last time WWE Evolution took place, Raquel Rodriguez was still training at the performance center hoping to be able to enter the ring with the superstars of today and tomorrow. On Sunday, she will get a chance to defend her tag-team championship with Roxanne Perez in one of the toughest matches on the card. The duo will put the titles on the line in a fatal four-way tag match against Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss, Sol Ruca and Zaria, and Kairi Sane and Asuka. Rodriguez expressed to Fox News Digital what Evolution meant to her the first time she saw the premium live event take place back in 2018.

(Cooper Neil/WWE via ) “This is a very exciting time for all the women in WWE, all the women that are just in general invested in wrestling around the world,” she said. “We only had one Evolution and I remember that was back in 2018, I was training at the performance center, I was biting my nails because I just wanted to be a part of it so bad. But it was a beautiful representation of women in wrestling, women in sports, and women of culture from just all over the world. “So, to know that we are able to have a women's Evolution 2 and have more women from our history and our future coming out to represent, I think it is going to be an absolutely amazing show. I can't wait to see all the women, little girls, and the abuelitas and tias that are gonna be in the stands cheering us on. I am just very grateful and very excited to be walking in as a WWE Women's Tag Team champion and walking out as a women's tag team champion. That's not going to change.” For Rodriguez, pro wrestling was in her blood. Her father, Rick, was an independent wrestler in Texas in the 1980s and 1990s, and she would watch him compete.

(Rich Freeda/WWE via ) CHARLOTTE FLAIR RECALLS CONTROVERSIAL WRESTLEMANIA 41 FACEOFF WITH TIFFANY STRATTON THAT 'ROCKED' HER She said that while Chyna and other female wrestlers of that time were inspiring, her interest in wrestling really was drawn from her father. “There was not just one person that I looked up to and wanted to emulate, I mean I looked up to many. I, obviously, cherished Chyna and Beth Phoenix for being the woman that they were, representing strong, tall woman,” Rodriguez said. “I think for me and my life, I mean, I was already 6 foot my freshman year of high school and I was taller than anybody and everybody since the young age of 4. I constantly felt different and not always in the best ways. And so, to see these women who were bigger than some of the men and stronger than some of the men was something I could relate too. I felt very seen and very heard and so I always loved watching them and looking to them for any inspiration. “I also always look to my dad as well. I am a daddy's girl and I say that in and out he has really guided me in a lot decisions I made in my life and I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him, for sure, and the sacrifices he made. Watching him and his work in wrestling really inspired me obviously from a young age because I have been saying I wanted to do this since I was a little girl. But even today, he keeps me very grounded, he keeps me at home. I am very, very blessed to have so many people I consider role models.” Rodriguez is a six-time women's tag team champion, four of which came with Liv Morgan. However, Morgan has been sidelined with a shoulder injury and Perez stepped into her place to fill in – at least for the time being. Rodriguez said she has all the confidence in the world that they will defend their titles successfully despite never actually teaming up with each other in an official match. Raquel Rodriguez enters the ring during Monday Night RAW at Nationwide Arena on June 23, 2025, in Columbus, Ohio. (Rich Freeda/WWE via ) “It is definitely going to be a challenge for us,” Rodriguez told Fox News Digital. “But I look at the other teams, and Alexa Bliss and Charlotte haven't really been together for that long. So, I would say they are in the same playing field as us. Asuka and Kairi – yes, Kabuki Warriors have a staple name in the women's tag division. They have been champions before. However, Asuka is just coming back from injury, and they haven't really done much tag work either since she has been back so I think she is in the same boat. CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP “Then we have Zaria and Sol and I have seen what they have been doing on NXT and I think they are doing absolutely tremendous work. Both very, very talented women, both seem to be a very good connection when it comes to women tag wrestling, but Sol has kind of been doing her own thing and so has Zaria. So I am not going to be too worried about their connection and their teamwork. I feel like they are kind of on the same playing field. Overall, I would say our tag matches have been pretty even, except for the fact that I am the most experienced in the women's tag division and I have the many titles.” Follow Fox News Digital's   sports coverage on X and subscribe to the Fox News Sports Huddle newsletter ...."
mov_200CC7328DFA6B985E2C5A5B1CCB3357,2025-07-13 09:47:09,en,WEB,"  For decades, maternity leave was placed in the hands of businesses and their human resource departments. Paid time off to care for a newborn, not to mention job protection for new parents, varied dramatically between companies. In 1993, then-President Bill Clinton signed the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) to provide unpaid job protection for U.S. workers on leave to care for family members or newborns. Find Out: 6 Subtly Genius Moves All Wealthy People Make With Their Money It was an important first step toward supporting parents in the workplace, as well as workers who would eventually become the “sandwich generation,” the cohort currently caring for children and aging parents. In 2002, California introduced a state-administered family medical leave program, followed by New Jersey and Rhode Island, according to the Department of Labor website. It wasn't until decades later, in 2017, that New York joined these states, introducing the most robust Paid Family Leave program at the time. The legislation kicked off a trend of state programs that support families caring for young children, older adults, ill or injured family members, and military families with a deployed spouse. “For years, paid leave just wasn't on the radar in most states. When New York introduced PFL in 2017, phasing in the benefits up to the maximum of 67% of an employee's average weekly wage, it launched a trend,” Michael S. Cohen, president and CEO of The DBL Center, a New York-based insurance wholesaler, said. “Now, 13 states and Washington D.C. require employers to provide paid family and medical leave, with two more starting in 2026.” Another 10 states have voluntary paid family leave programs, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. Trending Now: Suze Orman's Secret to a Wealthy Retirement--Have You Made This Money Move? How PFML Affects Your Paycheck Your state's paid family and medical leave policies can affect how you plan for maternity leave or the steps you take if you're caring for an older parent or other family member. In states that offer PFML, 12 weeks is the standard benefit duration. Most states allow you to take incremental leave in hours or days, which can be handy to plan for things like doctor's appointments or if you're sharing caregiving duties with another family member. The premium cost is typically 1% or less of an employee's pre-tax wages and is sometimes shared between the employer and employee. The difference in your paycheck is negligible for a benefit that can help so many families. New couples planning for children may want to consider state PFML policies before they buy a home, especially if they have job flexibility or can work remotely. Salary continuity of $1,000+ per week, in some cases, can make a big difference when you're planning for a baby. In the case of remote workers, most employees will file for PFML in the state where they work, regardless of where the company's office is located, according to Cohen. However, employers may not always be aware of state laws outside their home state, so it's important for workers to understand the benefits available. PFML is available for both the birthing and non-birthing parent, so a couple can take their 12 weeks separately, eliminating potential daycare costs for the first six months of an infant's life. Which State Has the Best Paid Family and Medical Leave Program? The DBL Center recently released a list of 7 states with the best PFML programs available through private carriers. “The cost savings and personalized service provided when businesses can write PFML through a private carrier exceeds anything offered through any of the state insurance funds,” Cohen explained. “Plus, when a business owner privatizes required benefits, a knowledgeable broker can help them use that savings on dental, vision, long-term care or group life insurance. Workers and business owners both win with better benefits.” To calculate the best states for PFML, The DBL Center factored in the maximum weekly benefit; the cost of the premium and whether it's funded by employees, employers, or shared; and which businesses are required to provide the benefit. Then, it compared the maximum benefit to the cost of living in that state to determine which state offered the best benefit relative to the cost of living. Here are the 7 states where you'll get the most bang for your buck if you have to file a PFML claim. State Max. Weekly Benefit Colorado $1,324.21 Oregon $1,568 New York $1,177.32 New Jersey $1,081 Delaware $900 Connecticut $981 Massachusetts $1,170.64 Will More States Introduce PFML?..."

mov_43F45F31B90A513F3048E6D8D5738274,2025-07-13 11:00:17,en,WEB,"  The measles outbreak in West Texas and beyond is only getting worse. Two , and measles cases are the  in . The bulk of measles cases have been in Texas, but states including New Jersey, New York, Washington, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania and Ohio have also reported cases. It's natural to be scared of this highly contagious virus, which in rare cases can cause death and severe illness, but not everyone has to have the same level of worry. (Yes, vaccination is key for your safety.) Below, doctors share who should be worried and what you should know if there's a measles case in your area. If you're sure that you're fully vaccinated against measles, you don't have much to worry about. People who are fully vaccinated against measles can breathe a sigh of relief; you likely are safe from any serious complications from measles even if you do get infected. “It's generally cited that the measles vaccine, assuming you've received two doses of the current MMR vaccine, current meaning since around 1969, is about 97% effective in preventing measles. So the vast majority of people have really little or nothing to be concerned about,” said , the chief of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. If a vaccinated person does get infected with measles, “The chance of that infection going on to have some kind of meaningful or clinically significant bad outcome is quite low,” said , an emergency medicine physician at Houston Methodist Hospital. “People, to the extent that they're able, should try to verify their vaccine history,” said Kuritzkes. But since most school districts required proof of measles vaccination to start school until the last few years and since nearly all children born between roughly in 1969 until the last few years have been vaccinated, “It's generally safe to assume that if you grew up in the United States and are under 60 years of age, that you have been been appropriately vaccinated,” noted Kuritzkes. (That is unless you know that your family didn't get you vaccinated.) If you were born before 1962 or 1963, you also likely don't have to worry. Before the measles vaccine was developed, . Meaning, those who were born before the measles vaccine was developed in 1963 are thought to have lifelong immunity from natural infection, said Kuritzkes. So, if you are old enough to have had measles, you don't need to be concerned about exposure now, he said. People who were vaccinated before 1969 may need to consider getting an additional booster. According to Kuritzkes, “There is this small group of people who were vaccinated [before] 1969 with a killed measles vaccine that is less effective than the live measles vaccine” that is now used in the MMR shot. This isn't a huge group of people, it's estimated to be about 1 million Americans, he said. “Those individuals should receive a measles booster with the current MMR if they have not already received that at some point during their adulthood,” Kuritzkes added. If you aren't sure of your vaccine history, you have a few choices. It's a scary time to not be sure if you're fully vaccinated against measles, but there are a couple of things you can do, according to , an associate professor of medicine in the division of infectious diseases at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. First, you can ask your doctor to run a blood test to see if you have antibodies to measles, he said. If you do have antibodies, that means you're protected. If you don't, you can set up an appointment for your shot. If you can't get the blood test, “The other option is to just get vaccinated. There is not harm in getting an extra dose of the MMR vaccine as an adult,” Angarone noted. While the vaccine is generally given at 12 months, babies can be vaccinated early in certain situations. Many people are rightfully concerned about infants as measles cases continue to crop up. “Babies who are under the age of 12-months-old, they're definitely at a risk for some measles complication if they're exposed to someone,” said Gandhi. Typically, babies are eligible for the first dose of the vaccine , but can get it earlier in certain situations. “Children can receive it as early as 6 months,” said Kuritzkes, “and so I think it depends a bit on individual circumstances. Certainly, if you were living in Texas or New Mexico, I would be thinking about vaccinating infants at 6 months of age because of how widespread the current outbreak is.” “If you're elsewhere in the country, it depends on what's happening in your community, and if you're planning to travel,” Kuritzkes said. It's often recommended that parents traveling with infants get them vaccinated before travel (so long as they're at least 6 months old). If your child is under 6 months and unable to get the shot, make sure the people who are around your child are vaccinated against measles, Angarone noted. And, if there's an outbreak in your immediate area, consider keeping them home until the outbreak dissipates. If you can't get the MMR vaccine because you're immunocompromised or pregnant, you need to take precautions. “For most people who are immunosuppressed, so people who are not on active chemotherapy or are not on high doses of steroids ... most of them we treat as if their immune system is working properly,” said Angarone. “And so that's where I think it becomes important for those individuals to really reach out to their health care providers,” Angarone added. This way, your doctor can help decipher if you can get the measles vaccine and how best to protect yourself. If you get exposed, measles virus is one of the, if not THE most contagious infectious diseases that we see, and so if you're exposed, there's not a lot we can do to prevent that infection from developing.Dr. Michael Angarone “The group that we're very mindful of are individuals that have more severe immunocompromised states,” he said, which includes those who have had an organ transplant, a stem cell transplant, have advanced HIV, are receiving chemotherapy, are on high-doses of steroid medication or have a hereditary immune compromised condition. The MMR vaccine is not recommended to people in these groups because “the vaccine is a live virus vaccine, and we worry about the potential adverse reactions to that live vaccine in someone who has a severe immune compromising condition,” said Angarone. So, unless there is a very large outbreak or there has been a thorough conversation with a doctor, it's not recommended for these folks to get the jab. This is also true for pregnant people as the live vaccine can put the fetus at risk, he said. So, what are unvaccinated people in these groups supposed to do?..."

It's sweet, energetic, and unmistakably Michael Jackson-inspired. In an era where modern music often chases viral hooks, Justin Bieber takes a different route, one that feels both refreshing and deliberate. It's a bold, if unexpected, way to kick off his seventh studio album, Swag, which closes just as grandly with a gospel outro. A long-awaited return Just hours after cryptically teasing his return, Bieber dropped Swag on Friday, July 11, his first full-length release in four years. With 21 tracks, the LP seems like an intentional attempt to make up for lost time. And it's not just fans who think so - both The Guardian and Rolling Stone have hailed the album as his most authentic and emotionally honest project to date. And honestly, it's hard to disagree. For many, this is Bieber's most self-aware and creatively liberated record since 2013's Journals. Even his former manager Scooter Braun, following a very public and fraught professional split, reluctantly praised the album, calling it “without a doubt, the most authentically Justin Bieber album to date.” In a surprisingly gracious Instagram Story, Braun added, “It's beautiful, raw, and truly him. And that matters.” Life changes reflected in the music A lot has changed for the 31-year-old since Justice landed in 2021. In 2022, Bieber cancelled the remainder of his world tour due to health concerns. In 2024, he became a father, welcoming his son, Jack Blues Bieber, with wife Hailey Bieber (who is also the founder of billion dollar skincare brand - Rhode). The weight of that life shift can be heard on Swag, particularly in tracks like Dadz Love, a tender mid-album moment."

mov_620E727C5DC73BC1F75B566D6A490D18,2025-07-13 17:35:02,en,WEB,"  MANILA, Philippines — US President Donald Trump's war against Ivy League schools is hampering a petition by Filipino-American students to establish a Tagalog language program at Brown University – an effort that has been ongoing for decades. The Filipino Alliance, composed of Fil-Am university students, has already gathered over 1,000 signatures urging Brown to join the ranks of Harvard and Yale in offering a Tagalog course. Petitioners, however, said Brown's administrators are preoccupied by the Trump administration's threats to cut funding, as creating a new program typically involves budgetary considerations. “A lot of the money that Brown had is slowly being eviscerated, so that's the rocky landscape we have to navigate,” Alexa Theodoropoulos, an incoming junior and vice president of the Filipino Alliance, told The STAR in an interview. According to Theodoropoulos, whose relatives reside in Taguig, Harvard and Yale have dedicated funds to their Asian studies programs from their own budgets and alumni donations. Harvard has begun teaching Tagalog in the academic year 2023 to 2024, while Yale will introduce its program by September to November this year. But Theodoropoulos said Brown's funds are shrinking, partly due to relentless White House attacks, prompting the university to implement belt-tightening measures, such as hiring freezes, pay cuts and reduced stipends for researchers. “In our situation, not only does Brown not have nearly as much money to begin with, and especially not for anything in Asian studies, but it's been operating at a loss, and has been actively losing more and more money, and is also in a bit of an existential crisis right now, because of how much funding it's losing, and because of the political threats,” she said. Trump is setting his sights on Ivy League schools over their alleged failure to combat antisemitism, and for serving as platforms for liberal indoctrination. The White House announced in April that it would block $510 million in federal contracts and grants to Brown. In its 2024 budget, the Rhode Island-based university received $184 million from the federal government. In addition, grants from the National Institutes of Health to Brown and four other Ivy League schools have been paused since April over research related to the LGBT community and diversity, equality and inclusion. The Filipino Alliance has long sought to establish a dedicated Tagalog program at Brown since the group's founding in 1988. An estimated 1.7 million people speak Tagalog in America, according to a 2022 report by the United States Census Bureau, making it the third most-spoken language outside of English. Advocates in the past have resorted to forming group independent study projects (GISPs) – courses designed by students outside the regular curriculum with a maximum of 20 enrollees and a faculty sponsor – which had to adjust their topics to be more accessible to professors, such as dissecting the Philippines as a US colony. Recently, the alliance has scored a victory in pushing a program on Southeast Asia's food history, in collaboration with the Southeast Asian Studies Initiative, so the group is now setting its sights on institutionalizing Tagalog classes. Anna Zulueta, Filipino Alliance co-president, said GISPs have become untenable due to the constant paperwork involved. “We decided that we actually need to become more serious about this and put more energy into it, seeing that these other paths that we had been using – it was kind of time to move on to the next thing,” Zulueta, who will graduate in December, told The STAR. Theodoropoulos said that Dawn King, Brown's deputy dean for curriculum, advised her in May to explore cross-enrollment in Harvard for Tagalog classes while the university considers hiring an official instructor. However, Harvard has no fixed policies for course sharing, she said, requiring separate negotiations with its administrators, which complicates the process. Both students said the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Philippine consulate in New York have shown interest in providing seed funding to hire a Tagalog teacher, but Brown would need to assess its legality since it would count as an international donation. Zulueta admitted that the Tagalog program likely won't materialize during her or Theodoropoulos's time, but the passion behind the initiative is driven by a desire for Filipinos to be better represented at Ivy League schools like Brown. “(Brown) should at least be doing justice to a language that so many people in the United States speak,” Zulueta said. “It is a method of repairing the wrongs of history and symbolizing just how much Filipinos have contributed to campus life and culture at Brown and in the United States,” she stressed. Zulueta, whose family lives in Quezon City but has ties to Cebu, added that her group is prepared to show patience, as Brown tends to “wait students out.” “We're really pushing to get this done, because if Brown doesn't approve it during our time, we're not sure when they will. And we're not sure how many students will be pushing for this as hard as we are,” she said."

The Miss Universe titleholder has long been open about her battle with endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the uterus lining grows outside the uterus. She revealed in an interview with NIH Medline Plus that her symptoms started when she was 15 years old, and “became much more intense” in her early 20s.

I've been dreaming of this for a long time,” this is what 49ers' Christian McCaffrey's wife, Olivia Culpo, remarked earlier. The former Miss Universe had been sharing her pregnancy journey since announcing the news on March 10. She kept fans hooked with regular maternity updates and glowing photos throughout her pregnancy. But the waiting game is officially over. The baby McCaffrey has officially arrived, and the NFL world couldn't be happier. Olivia Culpo and Christian McCaffrey welcomed their first child on July 13, 2025—a beautiful daughter named Colette. The former Miss Universe broke the news through an emotional Instagram post that had fans melting instantly. The couple, who said “I do” in Rhode Island just over a year ago, shared stunning black-and-white hospital photos. Baby Colette looked absolutely perfect lying on a fuzzy blanket, while another shot captured the new parents holding their precious bundle of joy. Pure magic in every frame. Culpo's Instagram Stories revealed her overwhelming gratitude. “Colette is so lucky to have the best daddy in the world. A love like no other,” she wrote alongside a heart-stopping photo of McCaffrey cradling their daughter. The raw emotion in that moment spoke volumes about their journey to parenthood. The birth wasn't just beautiful—it was intense. Culpo shared a powerful image of herself gripping McCaffrey's arm during delivery, calling it “the scariest and most rewarding of all experiences.” That vulnerable moment showed the reality behind the glamorous announcement. Expand Post This pregnancy meant everything to Culpo, especially after her endometriosis diagnosis created fertility fears. During a 2022 episode of “The Culpo Sisters,” she admitted, “I feel like I have to have kids ASAP.” Those concerns made this victory even sweeter. The couple kept their baby's gender a surprise throughout the pregnancy, though Culpo revealed she had “a strong intuition” it was a boy. Colette clearly had other plans, arriving to prove mom's intuition wrong in the most adorable way possible. March 2025 brought the pregnancy announcement through a dreamy maternity shoot captioned “next chapter, motherhood.” Now that chapter has officially begun with sleepless nights, tiny fingers, and endless love filling their home. Fans and the entire 49ers family have flooded their comments with congratulations, celebrating this incredible milestone. Social media erupts with love for the McCaffrey family's newest addition Miss Universe 2012 Olivia Culpo and NFL star Christian McCaffrey are soaking up every moment of new parenthood. The couple welcomed their baby daughter and immediately had Instagram buzzing with their gorgeous black-and-white announcement photos. The response was absolutely electric. Fans couldn't contain their excitement in the comments section. Brock Purdy's wife commented, “she looks perfect,” while Adam Schefter screamed, “Congratulations, McCaffreys! Welcome, Colette” after seeing the precious family moments. The love kept pouring in with messages like “sweet girl love you already” flooding their post within hours. Even the Miss Universe and NFL official pages jumped into the celebration, leaving congratulatory messages alongside thousands of other well-wishers. The pageant organization clearly wanted to honor their former queen's incredible milestone. Culpo took to her Instagram Story to shower McCaffrey with praise as a new father. She revealed he made her feel “at peace” during the intense delivery experience. That emotional support clearly meant everything to her during those scary but magical moments. The transformation from pregnancy to parenthood hit fans hard. Those stunning black-and-white maternity photos showed Culpo in full goddess mode, strategically covering herself while displaying her flourishing bump. The artistic shots captured her pregnancy glow perfectly. But these new photos tell a completely different story. Instead of pregnancy anticipation, they radiate pure parental love and exhaustion. The raw emotion in every frame shows the reality of welcoming their first child. Claire Kittle perfectly captured the moment's significance: “Slide 4 gets me, love you guys! .” That comment summed up exactly what everyone was feeling — this baby girl already has the world wrapped around her tiny fingers. The McCaffrey family announcement didn't just break the internet — it melted hearts across social media...."

mov_B890CFE10ECA131F9A0DBBA197BDFFCD,2025-07-14 04:01:41,en,WEB,"  Bridge Mentorship, the fundraising readiness and scaling guidance program from True Beauty Ventures and Beauty Independent, has named Happy Aging, Parëva and Nous as members of its second 2025 cohort. The brands were selected to the six-month program, which will run from July to December, because they address distinct white spaces in beauty. Co-founded entrepreneur and wellness advocate Martha Graeff and functional medicine specialist Daniel Yadegar, also founder of hair wellness brand Wellbel, Happy Aging is redefining ingestible beauty through the lens of longevity, offering elevated wellness shots created specifically for women to support their cellular function and stress resilience. Started by former StriVectin VP of product development and regulatory affairs Smitha Rao, Parëva takes a clinical, results-focused approach to skin longevity, pairing high active concentrations with clean formulation standards and full transparency around ingredient percentages. From Los Angeles hairstylist Tylor Johnson, Nous tackles practical, everyday haircare gaps with at-home color-refresh gloss and an SPF 30 dry shampoo that protects the scalp from damage from ultraviolet radiation. “These founders are building with purpose and clarity,” says Caroline Weintraub, VP at TBV. “They're not just following category trends, they're shaping them, whether it's through new delivery formats, radical transparency or performance-driven simplicity. Happy Aging was co-founded by wellness advocate and entrepreneur Martha Graeff and functional medicine specialist Daniel Yadegar. ”Consumers are moving away from idealized routines and toward solutions that actually fit their lives,” says Cristina Nuñez, co-founder of TBV. “That means products that work, are easy to use and don't require a trip to the salon or dermatologist. Convenience without compromise has become the new benchmark, and each of these brands delivers on that.” That demand for effective, streamlined solutions comes at a time when mergers and acquisitions are heating up in beauty (see Rhode, Medik8 and more), but early-stage investor discernment remains the order of the day. “We anticipate investment activity will stay highly selective through 2026, with a clear bias toward substance over story,” says TBV co-founder Rich Gersten. “Brands that are capital-efficient, demonstrate strong consumer pull and show a path to profitability are still attracting interest, especially as we see renewed M&A momentum from strategics. That tailwind could extend to earlier-stage opportunities for brands that earn investor conviction.” Bridge Mentorship aims to prepare emerging brands for precisely that moment. Through monthly group sessions, one-on-one partner diagnostics and hands-on examinations of go-to-market strategies, margin architecture, marketing spend and capital planning, the program provides tactical support rarely accessible to founders outside traditional networks. “Bridge isn't about generic advice, it's about founder-specific, business-specific feedback,” adds Nuñez. “By creating intentional spaces for learning and connection, we're not only helping individual brands accelerate, we're also helping build a stronger, more informed ecosystem across beauty.” Smitha Rao founded Parëva Beauty in 2024. Over the course of her career, she's led innovation and brand strategy for more than 15 brands, including StriVectin and Sugarbear. For the participating founders, the program supplies more than mentorship, it can be helpful launchpad for long-term growth. At Happy Aging, CEO Eduardo Vanzak is intent on scaling a science-first brand in the United States and sharpening retail and funding objectives. He says. “We're excited to join a like-minded community of founders and investors who believe in purpose-driven innovation and are building the future of wellness and beauty.” At Nous, Johnson hopes to deepen his understanding of the operational backbone it takes to grow a brand that lasts. He explains, “My goal is to come out of this program better equipped to make strategic decisions that drive sustainable growth and establish a lasting presence in the beauty space as a category disruptor.” Founded by Los Angeles hairstylist Tylor Johnson, Nous's assortment contains hair glosses, dry shampoo, shampoo and conditioner. For Smitha Rao, the mentorship journey is about tightening Parëva's approach and laying the groundwork for sustainable scale. “I'm looking to work closely with TBV mentors to develop a clear, actionable path to scale my business,” she says. “A key focus will be identifying and strengthening weak points in my strategy to proactively de-risk potential challenges.” Happy Aging, Parëva and Nous will share insights and milestones from their experience in a live In Conversation webinar in December."

Forty year old Phoebe Stone arrives at the beautiful, posh Cornwall Inn located in fabulous Newport, Rhode Island as the only person not a guest at the wedding of Lila and Gary. Phoebe has a purpose for being there—a horrible, self-destructive reason—which she shares with the bride who, of course, freaks out. Two people in particular will be put in Phoebe's life to change her destiny. Ironically, Phoebe unwittingly also changes the course of their lives, propelling them to futures they could not foresee. The beautiful bride Lila at first appears shallow and self-centered. We discover this is not entirely the case. After heartfelt conversations with Phoebe, Lila confesses her loneliness even when around family and supposed good friends. Lila's mother can't keep herself out of a story at the expense of robbing her daughter of her dignity. Lila's friends never tell her the truth and stick with the everything is wonderful response. For example, not one of her friends told Lila that she had food stuck between her two front teeth and allowed her to walk around and smile for photos of her wedding week festivities for a half-day photo session. Only Phoebe, at first a thorn in Lila's side, points out the food problem, creating an unexpected bond between the two women. The cast of characters is clearly delineated with speech and mannerisms uniquely crafted so the reader feels part of the scene. Expect four letter words and lots of sexual jokes, most of it coming from the ladies! After all, this is a week of pre-wedding festivities, including a bridal shower and comical family members. You will find a lot of truths about people in this book. We all display different personality traits based on the situation and the people we are with. Lila appears flighty but when with Phoebe, her serious side emerges. Lila's friends want to portray themselves as positive and encouraging when in truth, they are dishonest and uncaring. Lila's deceased father makes a death bed confession about something he hated throughout his marriage but kept his mouth shut to keep peace with his overbearing wife. Lila's rude, critical future sister-in-law keeps a lover on the side, unknown to her husband and family members. This one deserves its own paragraph. Phoebe's best friend appears noncommittal but actually sabotages Phoebe's marriage. People are multi-faceted, as are the characters in this book, keeping us involved in this fun, realistic portrayal. I couldn't put it down because I wanted to know what would happen next. This book is a great beach read or for when you just need to unwind from the seriousness of life around us. Please share your thoughts. I'd love to hear from you. You can email me at elainewrites@earthlink.net. I wish you all a life inspired by the wonder of the world around us. May you find and live your truth, in harmony with people, nature and the environment. May you be a force for good and a source of love and comfort. May the world be a better place for you having lived and loved here. All rights reserved 2025."

Die wunderbaren Neuigkeiten haben die stolzen Eltern nun in den sozialen Medien verkündet. Olivia Culpo, 33, und ihr Footballer-Ehemann Christian McCaffrey, 29, sind erstmals Eltern geworden. 2012 gewann das Model die Wahl zur Miss Rhode Island, bevor sie zur Miss United States und schließlich zur Miss Universe gekrönt wurde. Nun legt sie eine Pause ein, um sich voll und ganz um ihr Baby zu kümmern. Olivia Culpo hat ihr erstes Baby zur Welt gebracht Im Herbst 2024 hatten Olivia Culpo und ihr Mann das 14-Millionen-Dollar-Anwesen im englischen Stil von Hollywoodstars George Clooney, 63, und seine Ehefrau Amal Clooney, 47, erworben. Dort, in der exklusiven Wohngegend Fryman Canyon, die unweit von Beverly Hills entfernt liegt, haben die frischgebackenen Eltern in den vergangenen Monaten ein wunderschönes Kinderzimmer eingerichtet. In ihrer 650 Quadratmeter großen Villa in Los Angeles verbringen sie nun die ersten Tage mit ihrem neugeborenen Baby. Die wunderbaren Neuigkeiten, dass ihr Kind das Licht der Welt erblickt haben, hat Culpo via Instagrambekannt gegeben. Zu einer Reihe von Schwarz-Weiß-Fotos teilt sie am Sonntag, 13. Juli 2025, mit, dass ihre Tochter den Namen ""Colette Annalise McCaffrey"" trägt. Die ersten Babyfotos der Kleinen zeigen die intimen Momente aus dem Krankenhaus: Aufnahmen während sowie nach der Entbindung dokumentieren das kleine Wunder. Am Ende liegt Culpo müde, aber überglücklich im Bett, während McCaffrey ihr liebevoll zur Seite steht. Ihre Tochter ist auf gleich mehreren Bildern zu sehen – mal behutsam in den Armen ihres Vaters, dann wieder geborgen in Decken gewickelt, an der Brust ihrer Mutter. Stars in diesem Artikel Beschwerliche Schwangerschaftsmonate Die ersten Monate ihrer Schwangerschaft waren für Olivia Culpo beschwerlich. Die Frau von NFL-Star Christian McCaffrey, die sich gerne fit hält, konnte ihrer Sportleidenschaft jedoch nicht nachgehen. In einer Instagram-Story im März offenbarte sie: ""Ich konnte in den ersten vier Monaten meiner Schwangerschaft nicht trainieren (nicht einmal spazieren gehen!!!)"" . Im zweiten Trimester wurde es glücklicherweise besser. Da konnte die Influencerin ihr Training wieder ""nachholen"", wie sie erklärte. Dass Olivia Culpo überhaupt schwanger geworden ist, ist keine Selbstverständlichkeit. Bereits 2020 nahm sie ihre Follower:innen mit durch ihren herausfordernden Alltag mit Endometriose. Im November vor fünf Jahren teilte Culpo ein Foto nach ihrer Operation, um über die chronische Gebärmuttererkrankung aufzuklären. Luxuriöse Märchenhochzeit auf Rhode Island Ende Juni 2024, gut ein Jahr nach ihrer Verlobung, gaben sich Olivia Culpo und Christian McCaffrey das Jawort. Die luxuriöse Märchenhochzeit fand im Nobelviertel auf Rhode Island statt. Olivia sagte in einem Traumkleid von Dolce & Gabbana Ja zu ihrer großen Liebe. Sowohl für Culpo als McCaffrey stand von Anfang an fest, dass sie in einer Kirche heiraten wollten. ""Das war unsere oberste Priorität"", verrät die Braut im Gespräch mit ""Vogue"". Weiter betonte sie, welche Gewichtung die Ehe für sie im Leben hat: ""Es ist der Beginn des restlichen Lebens – und es ist die Vereinigung und Bindung zweier Menschen für immer.""
