Os vienen d√≠as muy negros . G√ºrtel, P√∫nica, Kitchen y m√°s de veinte causas judiciales sit√∫an al PP de Feij√≥o ante la mayor ola de corrupci√≥n 20 mayo, 2025 Actualidad 24 Noticias El Partido Popular liderado por Feij√≥o se enfrenta a 28 procesos judiciales por corrupci√≥n con m√°s de 150 cargos implicados El PP acumula 28 juicios por corrupci√≥n bajo la direcci√≥n de Feij√≥o con implicaciones hist√≥ricas para la pol√≠tica espa√±ola Estos incluyen las macrocausas m√°s medi√°ticas como G√ºrtel, P√∫nica, Lezo, Kitchen, Erial, Novo Carthago, el Campus de la Justicia de Madrid o la desaladora de Escombreras en Murcia, as√≠ como otros procedimientos menores. En conjunto, los tribunales han puesto en evidencia la magnitud de la trama: m√°s de 150 cargos p√∫blicos del PP est√°n implicados en estos sumarios. Entre ellos figuran ex altos cargos populares como el expresidente Mariano Rajoy (implicado en la llamada Operaci√≥n Catalu√±a), el exvicepresidente Rodrigo Rato, la exministra Ana Mato, el exministro de Interior Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az, el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana y varios l√≠deres regionales, como el expresidente murciano Pedro Antonio S√°nchez o el exmandatario de Murcia Ram√≥n Luis Valc√°rcel. La cuant√≠a de las penas solicitadas es enorme: por ejemplo, la Fiscal√≠a pide d√©cadas de c√°rcel para Rato por fraudes econ√≥micos. Calendario judicial de las macrocausas pendientes El calendario judicial de estos procesos se extiende a lo largo de varios a√±os. Entre los hitos ya conocidos destacan: Caso Rato (Audiencia Provincial de Madrid): El exministro Rodrigo Rato fue juzgado entre diciembre de 2023 y mayo de 2024 por delitos fiscales (caso Bankia) y uso indebido de tarjetas (tarjetas Black). Cumpli√≥ condena por estas tarjetas y tiene pendiente un juicio por un presunto fraude en la salida a bolsa de Bankia. Caso Erial (Audiencia Provincial de Valencia): En octubre de 2024 se dict√≥ sentencia no firme contra el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana, condenado a 10 a√±os y 5 meses de prisi√≥n por blanqueo, cohecho, falsedad documental y prevaricaci√≥n en la adjudicaci√≥n de estaciones de ITV (pelotazo de las ITV). A√∫n puede recurrirse este fallo ante el Tribunal Supremo. Operaci√≥n P√∫nica (Audiencia Nacional, Madrid): La pieza principal del caso ‚Äìel supuesto ama√±o de contratos de eficiencia energ√©tica a la empresa Cofely‚Äì tiene fecha de juicio: la vista oral empezar√° el 7 de abril de 2025 y durar√° hasta mayo. Se sentar√°n 37 acusados en el banquillo, incluidos nueve exalcaldes (siete del PP) de Madrid y Extremadura, por la adjudicaci√≥n irregular de contratos municipales de m√°s de 224 millones de euros. Adem√°s de esta pieza, otras diez piezas separadas de P√∫nica siguen pendientes de juicio. Operaci√≥n Kitchen (Audiencia Nacional): El tribunal fij√≥ el juicio para mayo-junio de 2026. En este caso se enjuiciar√° a los exministros del Interior Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az y Francisco Mart√≠nez, as√≠ como a varios comisarios de Polic√≠a por la trama policial ilegal montada en 2013 para espiar al extesorero Luis B√°rcenas. La Fiscal√≠a solicita 15 a√±os de c√°rcel para Fern√°ndez D√≠az y Mart√≠nez. Caso Novo Carthago (Murcia): El proceso por la urbanizaci√≥n ilegal de Novo Carthago, en el que est√°n imputados exconsejeros murcianos, sufri√≥ un aplazamiento judicial. Debido a una huelga de letrados se ha pospuesto la vista oral hasta 2025. Caso Campus de la Justicia (Audiencia Nacional): En septiembre de 2024 la Audiencia Nacional conden√≥ a 7 a√±os de prisi√≥n a Alfredo Prada, exconsejero de Justicia de la Comunidad de Madrid en el Gobierno de Esperanza Aguirre, por prevaricaci√≥n y malversaci√≥n en contratos ama√±ados del proyecto del Campus Judicial. Cuatro exdirectivos del proyecto recibieron penas menores (3,5 a√±os). Caso Desaladora de Escombreras (Audiencia Provincial de Murcia): El expresidente murciano Ram√≥n Luis Valc√°rcel enfrenta en julio de 2024 una vista de conformidad que podr√≠a evitar el juicio oral. Se le investiga por presuntos delitos de malversaci√≥n, prevaricaci√≥n y fraude en la construcci√≥n y rescate de la desaladora de Escombreras. La fiscal√≠a pide 11 a√±os de c√°rcel y fuertes inhabilitaciones. La jueza instructora orden√≥ en 2023 juicio oral contra Valc√°rcel tras advertir indicios de delito. Caso G√ºrtel: Varias piezas de esta trama originada hace a√±os siguen su curso. Por ejemplo, en la pieza 5 (pelotazo Orange Market de los contratos de la Generalitat Valenciana) est√°n pendientes sentencias pr√≥ximas contra figuras como Francisco Camps. Asimismo, el Supremo debe resolver recursos contra la sentencia de la denominada caja B del PP, que conden√≥ al extesorero B√°rcenas. En la Comunidad de Madrid hay otra caja B investigada en una pieza separada del caso P√∫nica. En conjunto, quedan al menos cuatro causas G√ºrtel pendientes en distintas fases. Otros casos pendientes: El caso Lezo (gesti√≥n de Canal Isabel II) mantiene varias piezas con exconsejeros procesados, aunque a√∫n no se ha fijado fecha de juicio definitiva. Tambi√©n contin√∫an las investigaciones por las irregularidades en las cajas de ahorros (casos Caja B y Bankia) y el rescate de las autopistas radiales, con procesos judiciales abiertos donde el PP figura como responsable civil. Los magistrados Enrique L√≥pez y Concepci√≥n Espejel han sido apartados de varios tribunales debido a sus acusados v√≠nculos con el PP. Estos jueces, que llegaron a ser elegidos con el apoyo popular, hab√≠an sido recusados por la Fiscal√≠a y la acusaci√≥n popular por su ‚Äúafinidad‚Äù al partido. El caso m√°s reciente fue su relevo en el juicio de la financiaci√≥n ilegal (caja üòé del PP. Este tipo de recusaciones ha alimentado cr√≠ticas de que existe una ‚Äúinstrumentalizaci√≥n de la justicia‚Äù con motivaciones pol√≠ticas. Incluso el presidente Pedro S√°nchez denunci√≥ p√∫blicamente casos de ‚Äúlawfare‚Äù (uso pol√≠tico de la justicia), citando la Operaci√≥n Kitchen como ejemplo de persecuci√≥n pol√≠tica contra el PP. Voces de la oposici√≥n recalcan que estas estrategias minan la imparcialidad y exigen garant√≠as de neutralidad en los tribunales. En conclusi√≥n, la intensa actividad judicial ha convertido al PP de Feij√≥o en la formaci√≥n pol√≠tica con m√°s procesos abiertos por corrupci√≥n en Espa√±a. Los 28 juicios por corrupci√≥n del PP previstos hasta 2029 marcar√°n la agenda pol√≠tica y judicial. El partido lo atribuye a casos del pasado anteriores a la actual direcci√≥n, mientras sus cr√≠ticos lo interpretan como la mayor constelaci√≥n de casos de corrupci√≥n en la historia reciente del pa√≠s. El tiempo y los tribunales dir√°n hasta qu√© punto estas causas consolidan o desaf√≠an la credibilidad del PP en el poder"

So far, the veracity of their labeling in terms of the dosage and cause/effect relationship aimed at the consumer. The aim is to analyze the health claims and the dosage presented on the labeling of caffeine supplements and to evaluate if they follow the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and international criteria. A descriptive cross-sectional study of a sample of caffeine supplements was carried out. The search was done through the Amazon and Google Shopping web portals. In order to assess the adequacy of the health claims, the guidelines of reference established by European Food Safety Authority were compared to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, International Olympic Committee, and Australian Institute of Sport guidelines; in addition, recent systematic reviews were addressed. A review of labels of 42 caffeine supplements showed that, in less than 3% of the products were the health claims supported by the recommendations and by the labeled quantity of caffeine. The claims that fully complied the recommendations were, ""improves or increases endurance performance"", ""improves strength performance"", or ""improves short-term performance"". In most cases, the recommended dosage was 200 mg/day for these products, which is the minimum for the caffeine effects to be declared. The rest of the health claims were not adequate or need to be modified. Most of the health claims identified indicated an unproven cause and effect, which constitutes consumer fraud, and so must be modified or eliminated.In this paper, we propose a general method to detect outliers from contaminated estimates of various image estimation applications. The method does not require any prior knowledge about the purpose, theory or hardware of the application but simply relies on the law of edge consistency between sources and estimates. The method is termed as ALRe (anchored linear residual) because it is based on the residual of weighted local linear regression with an equality constraint exerted on the measured pixel. Given a pair of source and contaminated estimate, ALRe offers per-pixel outlier likelihoods, which can be used to compose the data weights of post-refinement algorithms, improving the quality of refined estimate. ALRe has the features of asymmetry, no false positive and linear complexity. Its effectiveness is verified on four applications, four post-refinement algorithms and three datasets. It demonstrates that, with the help of ALRe, refined estimates are better in the aspects of both quality and edge consistency. The results are even comparable to model-based and hardware-based methods. Accuracy comparison on synthetic images shows that ALRe could detect outliers reliably. It is as effective as the mainstream weighted median filter at spike detection and is significantly better at bad region detection.Alveolar bone ridge resorption occurred after natural teeth loss and it can restrict the possibility of dental implants placement. The use of bone regenerative procedures is frequently required. GDC0084 The existing evidence regarding the efficacy of horizontal bone ridge augmentation trough guided bone regeneration (GBR) using polymeric membranes was stated. A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed. Electronic and manual literature searches were conducted. Screening process was done using the National Library of Medicine (MEDLINE by PubMed), Embase, and the Cochrane Oral Health. Included articles were randomized controlled trials and observational studies. Weighted means were calculated. Heterogeneity was determined using Higgins (I2). If I2 > 50% a random-effects model was applied. It was found that the mean of horizontal bone gain was 3.95 mm, ranging from 3.19 to 4.70 mm (confidence interval 95%). Heterogeneity is I2 = 99% (confidence interval 95%) and significance of the random-effects model was p¬†less then¬†0.001. The complications rate was 8.4% and membrane exposure was the most frequent. Through this study, we were able to conclude that the existing scientific evidence suggests that GBR using polymeric membranes is a predictable technique for achieving horizontal bone augmentation, thus, permitting a proper further implant placement.There exist three main types of endogenous opioid peptides, enkephalins, dynorphins and Œ≤-endorphin, all of which are derived from their precursors. These endogenous opioid peptides act through opioid receptors, including mu opioid receptor (MOR), delta opioid receptor (DOR) and kappa opioid receptor (KOR), and play important roles not only in analgesia, but also many other biological processes such as reward, stress response, feeding and emotion. The MOR gene, OPRM1, undergoes extensive alternative pre-mRNA splicing, generating multiple splice variants or isoforms. One type of these splice variants, the full-length 7 transmembrane (TM) Carboxyl (C)-terminal variants, has the same receptor structures but contains different intracellular C-terminal tails. The pharmacological functions of several endogenous opioid peptides through the mouse, rat and human OPRM1 7TM C-terminal variants have been considerably investigated together with various mu opioid ligands. The current review focuses on the studies of these endogenous opioid peptides and summarizes the results from early pharmacological studies, including receptor binding affinity and G protein activation, and recent studies of Œ≤-arrestin2 recruitment and biased signaling, aiming to provide new insights into the mechanisms and functions of endogenous opioid peptides, which are mediated through the OPRM1 7TM C-terminal splice variants.We compared the prognostic performances of serum neuron-specific enolase (sNSE), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NSE (cNSE), and CSF S100 calcium-binding protein B (cS100B) in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA) survivors. This prospective observational study enrolled 45 patients. All samples were obtained immediately and at 24 h intervals until 72 h after the return of spontaneous circulation. The inter- and intragroup differences in biomarker levels, categorized by 3 month neurological outcome, were analyzed. The prognostic performances were evaluated with receiver operating characteristic curves. Twenty-two patients (48.9%) showed poor outcome. At all-time points, sNSE, cNSE, and cS100B were significantly higher in the poor outcome group than in the good outcome group. cNSE and cS100B significantly increased over time (baseline vs. 24, 48, and 72 h) in the poor outcome group than in the good outcome group. sNSE at 24, 48, and 72 h showed significantly lower sensitivity than cNSE or cS100B. The sensitivities associated with 0 false-positive rate (FPR) for cNSE and cS100B were 66."

Entre ellos figuran ex altos cargos populares como el expresidente Mariano Rajoy (implicado en la llamada Operaci√≥n Catalu√±a), el exvicepresidente Rodrigo Rato, la exministra Ana Mato, el exministro de Interior Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az, el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana y varios l√≠deres regionales, como el expresidente murciano Pedro Antonio S√°nchez o el exmandatario de Murcia Ram√≥n Luis Valc√°rcel. La cuant√≠a de las penas solicitadas es enorme: por ejemplo, la Fiscal√≠a pide d√©cadas de c√°rcel para Rato por fraudes econ√≥micos. Calendario judicial de las macrocausas pendientes El calendario judicial de estos procesos se extiende a lo largo de varios a√±os. Entre los hitos ya conocidos destacan: Caso Rato (Audiencia Provincial de Madrid): El exministro Rodrigo Rato fue juzgado entre diciembre de 2023 y mayo de 2024 por delitos fiscales (caso Bankia) y uso indebido de tarjetas (tarjetas Black). Cumpli√≥ condena por estas tarjetas y tiene pendiente un juicio por un presunto fraude en la salida a bolsa de Bankia. Caso Erial (Audiencia Provincial de Valencia): En octubre de 2024 se dict√≥ sentencia no firme contra el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana, condenado a 10 a√±os y 5 meses de prisi√≥n por blanqueo, cohecho, falsedad documental y prevaricaci√≥n en la adjudicaci√≥n de estaciones de ITV (pelotazo de las ITV). A√∫n puede recurrirse este fallo ante el Tribunal Supremo. Operaci√≥n P√∫nica (Audiencia Nacional, Madrid): La pieza principal del caso ‚Äìel supuesto ama√±o de contratos de eficiencia energ√©tica a la empresa Cofely‚Äì tiene fecha de juicio: la vista oral empezar√° el 7 de abril de 2025 y durar√° hasta mayo. Se sentar√°n 37 acusados en el banquillo, incluidos nueve exalcaldes (siete del PP) de Madrid y Extremadura, por la adjudicaci√≥n irregular de contratos municipales de m√°s de 224 millones de euros. Adem√°s de esta pieza, otras diez piezas separadas de P√∫nica siguen pendientes de juicio. Operaci√≥n Kitchen (Audiencia Nacional): El tribunal fij√≥ el juicio para mayo-junio de 2026.

Oleanolic acid is a bioactive pentacyclic triterpenoid and is widely found in medicinal herbs around the world. In this study, we explored the effect of oleanolic acid on renal fibrosis and the underlying molecular mechanisms by using a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered with oleanolic acid (6‚Äâmg/kg/d) or vehicle (olive oil) for 21 days after the UUO surgery. Upon termination, urine and blood were collected for renal function analysis, and kidneys were harvested for pathological analysis by using hematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichrome staining. Changes of extracellular matrix mRNA expressions and TGF-Œ≤/Smad signaling in the kidneys were also determined. As a result, oleanolic acid significantly reduced the kidney index, the level of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and the urinary level of microalbumin, Œ±1-microglobulin, and N-acetyl-Œ≤-glucosaminidase. Masson trichrome staining showed significantly less collagen deposition in the UUO rats with oleanolic acid treatment. Diminished mRNA expressions of collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, and Œ±-SMA in the kidney tissues were observed after the treatment. Oleanolic acid led to decreased protein expressions of TGF-Œ≤, TGF-Œ≤ receptor I, and TGF-Œ≤ receptor II, as well as the phosphorylation of Smad2. Our current study suggested that oleanolic acid could be a complementary and alternative therapy for renal fibrosis potentially by targeting the TGF-Œ≤/Smad pathway.

Ranunculus bulumei, which is used as an herb in Indonesia, belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which has been reported to perform various physiological effects including antioxidant and anti-inflammation. However, data on the pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical utility of Ranunculus bulumei have not been reported. Therefore, we evaluated the antiaging efficacy of RB-ME, a methanol extract of Ranunculus bulumei. Rb-ME attenuated MMP9 and COX-2 gene expression but enhanced SIRT1 and type-1 collagen in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells. Rb-ME regulated these gene expressions through inhibition of p38 phosphorylation and inactivation of AP-1. In addition, mRNA expression of HAS-2 and -3, which are involved in skin hydration, was elevated in Rb-ME-treated HaCaT cells. Rb-ME also inhibited melanogenesis by suppression of tyrosinase, MITF, and TYRP-1 mRNA in B16F10 cells under Œ±-MSH treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that Rb-ME has a protective effect on some UVB-induced skin photoaging events such as inflammation, collagen degradation, cellular senescence, skin drying, and melanin production through inhibition of the p38-AP-1 signal cascade, indicating that Rb-ME can be used as an active ingredient for antiaging cosmetics.

Nevertheless, there are no studies evaluating the potential developmental toxicity of germinated grains despite the availability of numerous research studies demonstrating the teratogenicity effect of unsprouted seeds. Therefore, this research work was conducted to assess the impact of fenugreek sprouts on maternal and neurobehavioral developmental toxicities on mice. The lyophilized aqueous extract of germinated seeds was administered via oral gavage on a daily basis to five groups of mated female mice throughout pregnancy at doses of 200, 500, 800, and 1000‚Äâmg/kg/day and the control group was administered distilled water. Maternal reproductive toxicity was evaluated, and the surviving pups were assessed for their physical development, malformation, and neurobehavioral toxicity by using a battery of tests from birth to the 25th postnatal day. Additionally, the aqueous extract of germinated and ungerminated seeds was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for a comparison of their major compounds. For pregnant treated female mice, no death and no intoxication symptoms have been registered during the test. However, the sprouts' extract has provoked a significant decrease in fertility, spontaneous abortion, pup's mortality, and neurobehavioral disorder in offspring. HPLC analysis reveals an increase in total phenolic compound concentration by the process of sprouting.

Therefore, the search for new therapies to counteract this disease is very active. Grias neuberthii is an endemic plant located in the Ecuadorian Amazon region, which has been used in traditional medicine for its pharmacological properties, including its ability to inhibit tumor cell growth, although scientific studies are limited. We have analyzed the effect of this plant on two colon carcinoma cell lines, that is, RKO (normal p53) and SW613-B3 (mutated p53) cells. Among several extracts obtained from various parts of G. neuberthii plant, we identified the extract with the greatest cytotoxic potential, derived from the stem bark. The cytotoxic effect was similar on both cell lines, thus indicating that it is independent of the status of p53. However, significant differences were observed after the analysis of colony formation, with RKO cells being more sensitive than SW613-B3."

En conjunto, los tribunales han puesto en evidencia la magnitud de la trama: m√°s de 150 cargos p√∫blicos del PP est√°n implicados en estos sumarios. Entre ellos figuran ex altos cargos populares como el expresidente Mariano Rajoy (implicado en la llamada Operaci√≥n Catalu√±a), el exvicepresidente Rodrigo Rato, la exministra Ana Mato, el exministro de Interior Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az, el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana y varios l√≠deres regionales, como el expresidente murciano Pedro Antonio S√°nchez o el exmandatario de Murcia Ram√≥n Luis Valc√°rcel. La cuant√≠a de las penas solicitadas es enorme: por ejemplo, la Fiscal√≠a pide d√©cadas de c√°rcel para Rato por fraudes econ√≥micos. Calendario judicial de las macrocausas pendientes El calendario judicial de estos procesos se extiende a lo largo de varios a√±os. Entre los hitos ya conocidos destacan: Caso Rato (Audiencia Provincial de Madrid): El exministro Rodrigo Rato fue juzgado entre diciembre de 2023 y mayo de 2024 por delitos fiscales (caso Bankia) y uso indebido de tarjetas (tarjetas Black). Cumpli√≥ condena por estas tarjetas y tiene pendiente un juicio por un presunto fraude en la salida a bolsa de Bankia. Caso Erial (Audiencia Provincial de Valencia): En octubre de 2024 se dict√≥ sentencia no firme contra el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana, condenado a 10 a√±os y 5 meses de prisi√≥n por blanqueo, cohecho, falsedad documental y prevaricaci√≥n en la adjudicaci√≥n de estaciones de ITV (pelotazo de las ITV). A√∫n puede recurrirse este fallo ante el Tribunal Supremo. Operaci√≥n P√∫nica (Audiencia Nacional, Madrid): La pieza principal del caso ‚Äìel supuesto ama√±o de contratos de eficiencia energ√©tica a la empresa Cofely‚Äì tiene fecha de juicio: la vista oral empezar√° el 7 de abril de 2025 y durar√° hasta mayo. Se sentar√°n 37 acusados en el banquillo, incluidos nueve exalcaldes (siete del PP) de Madrid y Extremadura, por la adjudicaci√≥n irregular de contratos municipales de m√°s de 224 millones de euros. Adem√°s de esta pieza, otras diez piezas separadas de P√∫nica siguen pendientes de juicio. Operaci√≥n Kitchen (Audiencia Nacional): El tribunal fij√≥ el juicio para mayo-junio de 2026. En este caso se enjuiciar√° a los exministros del Interior Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az y Francisco Mart√≠nez, as√≠ como a varios comisarios de Polic√≠a por la trama policial ilegal montada en 2013 para espiar al extesorero Luis B√°rcenas. La Fiscal√≠a solicita 15 a√±os de c√°rcel para Fern√°ndez D√≠az y Mart√≠nez. Caso Novo Carthago (Murcia): El proceso por la urbanizaci√≥n ilegal de Novo Carthago, en el que est√°n imputados exconsejeros murcianos, sufri√≥ un aplazamiento judicial. Debido a una huelga de letrados se ha pospuesto la vista oral hasta 2025. Caso Campus de la Justicia (Audiencia Nacional): En septiembre de 2024 la Audiencia Nacional conden√≥ a 7 a√±os de prisi√≥n a Alfredo Prada, exconsejero de Justicia de la Comunidad de Madrid en el Gobierno de Esperanza Aguirre, por prevaricaci√≥n y malversaci√≥n en contratos ama√±ados del proyecto del Campus Judicial. Cuatro exdirectivos del proyecto recibieron penas menores (3,5 a√±os). Caso Desaladora de Escombreras (Audiencia Provincial de Murcia): El expresidente murciano Ram√≥n Luis Valc√°rcel enfrenta en julio de 2024 una vista de conformidad que podr√≠a evitar el juicio oral. Se le investiga por presuntos delitos de malversaci√≥n, prevaricaci√≥n y fraude en la construcci√≥n y rescate de la desaladora de Escombreras. La fiscal√≠a pide 11 a√±os de c√°rcel y fuertes inhabilitaciones. La jueza instructora orden√≥ en 2023 juicio oral contra Valc√°rcel tras advertir indicios de delito. Caso G√ºrtel: Varias piezas de esta trama originada hace a√±os siguen su curso. Por ejemplo, en la pieza 5 (pelotazo Orange Market de los contratos de la Generalitat Valenciana) est√°n pendientes sentencias pr√≥ximas contra figuras como Francisco Camps. Asimismo, el Supremo debe resolver recursos contra la sentencia de la denominada caja B del PP, que conden√≥ al extesorero B√°rcenas. En la Comunidad de Madrid hay otra caja B investigada en una pieza separada del caso P√∫nica. En conjunto, quedan al menos cuatro causas G√ºrtel pendientes en distintas fases. Otros casos pendientes: El caso Lezo (gesti√≥n de Canal Isabel II) mantiene varias piezas con exconsejeros procesados, aunque a√∫n no se ha fijado fecha de juicio definitiva. Tambi√©n contin√∫an las investigaciones por las irregularidades en las cajas de ahorros (casos Caja B y Bankia) y el rescate de las autopistas radiales, con procesos judiciales abiertos donde el PP figura como responsable civil. Los magistrados Enrique L√≥pez y Concepci√≥n Espejel han sido apartados de varios tribunales debido a sus acusados v√≠nculos con el PP. Estos jueces, que llegaron a ser elegidos con el apoyo popular, hab√≠an sido recusados por la Fiscal√≠a y la acusaci√≥n popular por su ‚Äúafinidad‚Äù al partido. El caso m√°s reciente fue su relevo en el juicio de la financiaci√≥n ilegal (caja B) del PP. Este tipo de recusaciones ha alimentado cr√≠ticas de que existe una ‚Äúinstrumentalizaci√≥n de la justicia‚Äù con motivaciones pol√≠ticas. Incluso el presidente Pedro S√°nchez denunci√≥ p√∫blicamente casos de ‚Äúlawfare‚Äù (uso pol√≠tico de la justicia), citando la Operaci√≥n Kitchen como ejemplo de persecuci√≥n pol√≠tica contra el PP. Voces de la oposici√≥n recalcan que estas estrategias minan la imparcialidad y exigen garant√≠as de neutralidad en los tribunales. En conclusi√≥n, la intensa actividad judicial ha convertido al PP de Feij√≥o en la formaci√≥n pol√≠tica con m√°s procesos abiertos por corrupci√≥n en Espa√±a. Los 28 juicios por corrupci√≥n del PP previstos hasta 2029 marcar√°n la agenda pol√≠tica y judicial. El partido lo atribuye a casos del pasado anteriores a la actual direcci√≥n, mientras sus cr√≠ticos lo interpretan como la mayor constelaci√≥n de casos de corrupci√≥n en la historia reciente del pa√≠s. El tiempo y los tribunales dir√°n hasta qu√© punto estas causas consolidan o desaf√≠an la credibilidad del PP en el poder"" Ra√∫l Velarde"

Based on a recent related EUFOREA panel discussion, literature search, and review of the best overseas practices, an appropriate implementation strategy of multidisciplinary care and its potential results are presented. Organizational principles, hurdles, and challenges of the process, as well as envisaged solutions and results, are being reported. The efficiency of care and the quality control assessment are concepts that are currently gaining importance. At the same time, novel treatment options based on molecular and precision medicine advancements, such as biologics, are being increasingly prescribed. Appropriately organized multidisciplinary care teams can adapt to new demands, data, and discoveries to assure maximum benefit for both patients and healthcare professionals.Training lay health workers is a critical intervention strategy to support HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) implementation. However, few evaluations of such trainings have been published. We conducted multi-time-point surveys to evaluate the effect of a training intervention on knowledge, PrEP stigma, and implementation behavior among lay HIV workers in China. Results indicated high acceptability and appropriateness of the training. PrEP knowledge score increased by 65% from pre- to post-training, and remained high one-month post-training. We observed a significant decrease in PrEP stigma and a positive influence on determinants of implementation behaviors. All lay HIV workers surveyed one-month after the training reported having disseminated PrEP information in social networks; 43% reported integrating PrEP education into routine work. The training is an effective strategy to build lay HIV workers' capacity in PrEP implementation. Longer-term post-training follow up would be ideal to further assess actual PrEP uptake and sustained effects on PrEP implementation.This study was conducted on forty adult rats divided into four groups Group I (control) that is divided into subgroups A, B, and C and Group II (methotrexate (MTX)-treated); the rats were injected intraperitoneally with MTX at a dose of 1 mg/kg/week, for 8 weeks. Group III (MTX-Se co-treated) was injected with MTX like Group II plus an oral administration of selenium at a dose of 10 Œºg/kg b.w/day, for 8 weeks. Group IV (MTX-PRP co-treated), rats were injected intraperitoneally with MTX like Group II plus platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injection under the scrotum, three times with 2-week intervals (volume-0.1 ml per injection) and euthanized after 8 weeks. Histological, immunohistochemical, and genetic expression using qPCR and western blotting technique were conducted. There was improvement in histological structure of testes in most specimens of Group IV. The latter group revealed a significant decrease in Bax and an increase in Bcl-2. The regeneration of testicular tissue was more observed in Group IV as measured by an increase in mean number of PCNA. Moreover, Group IV revealed an increased genetic level of FSCN3, GCNF, UBQLN3, and DAZL. Both MTX-Se and MTX-PRP have an anti-inflammatory effect as measured by a reduction in NF-Œ∫b. The anti-oxidative effect of selenium and PRP was noticed by a decrease in the level of the iNos and an increase in eNos protein and the autophagy marker LC3. PRP has ameliorative effects on induced rat testicular toxicity as evaluated by morphological changes and confirmed by immunohistochemical reactions, genetic expression, and western blotting analyses including oxidative and anti- oxidative markers.Cryopreservation of testicular cells and tissues is useful for the preservation and restoration of fertility in pre-pubertal males expecting gonadotoxic treatment for cancer and genetic diseases causing impaired spermatogenesis. A number of freezing and vitrification protocols have thus been tried and variable results have been reported in terms of cell viability spermatogenesis progression and the production of fertile spermatozoa. A few studies have also reported the production of live offspring from cryopreserved testicular stem cells and tissues in rodents but their replication in large animals and human have been lacking. Advancement in in vitro spermatogenesis system has improved the possibility of producing fertile spermatozoa from the cryopreserved testis and has reduced the dependency on transplantation. This review provides an update on various cryopreservation strategies for fertility preservation in males expecting gonadotoxic treatment. It also discusses various methods of assessing and ameliorating cryoinjuries. Newer developments on in vitro spermatogenesis and testicular tissue engineering for in vitro sperm production from cryopreserved SSCs and testicular tissue are also discussed. The quality of life (QoL) of children and adolescents with cleft lip/palate (CL/P) has been shown to be a predictor of good psychosocial functioning in this population group. This study aimed to measure QoL, from the patient¬¥s perception of change produced by the different surgical and orthodontic treatments carried out since early childhood, and if gender and age are modulating the outcome variables results. A cross-sectional research study was carried out. The study included 60 patients with cleft lip, cleft palate, or cleft lip/palate, aged between 8 and 18, who were in orthodontic treatment and had undergone at least one surgery. check details They were asked to complete the Quality-of-Life Adolescent Cleft Questionnaire (QoLAdoCleft), which allows the assessment of the QoL through self-perception of improvement after surgical and orthodontic interventions. In particular, this questionnaire (administered only once), allows the evaluation of self-perception of QoL at the present time and before orthodontic and surgilts indicated that patients perceived their quality of life had improved as a result of the treatments received, with the highest effect sizes found in the physical health domain. Specifically, the improvement in QoL in behaviour and social function tended to be influenced to a greater extent by perception of previous QoL. In this sense, personalized preventative measures from holistic and biopsychosocial approaches are necessary."
mxteinu,2025-06-14 22:38:50,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ I agree with the commenter who said exercise is important. When I was depressed I would walk outside on my lunch breaks and getting the sun shining on me and some physical activity helped so much. My insurance did not cover mental health (and I was working in the medical field at that time, of all places), so I turned to the K-Health app to get antidepressants and anti anxiety medication because it was the most affordable. It was life changing, I was in the same rut as you where my job was depressing me but the medication turned it around. You can also use an app to get connected with a therapist for talk therapy so I would look into that as well. If you feel like you're not confident in ingredients or the skincare offered, research the skincare line and see what things they have available for you to read. I take notes (I do the best writing it down in a notebook, something about it is more helpful than just reading or typing on my laptop or phone) on the skincare line...I'll write down each product, 3 key ingredients in the product, what skin type is best suited for the product, and what the skincare product is aiming to do. I keep the notebook in my treatment room and read it throughout the day to memorize it. I also follow lots of estheticians on social media and consume their content because they talk about their favorite ingredients and products. It helps me because when a client brings up a new treatment or the skincare they're currently using, odds are ive seen a tiktok or IG reel about it and can converse about it. It also motivates me to see other estheticians being excited about working, helps me to be excited to be an esthetician. Aside from taking notes for skincare, I do personal Journaling. Just spend 5-10 minutes at the end or beginning of the day writing down how im feeling, why im feeling that way, what I want to change. You can write whatever you feel and its very stress relieving. Also make sure you have a good diet, kick out the sugar and processed foods and eat fresh fruits and vegetables. It really does affect our mental health and I do think there's a connection between what we eat and our mental state. Meal prepping was helpful for me as well (having 2 or 3 simple meals I would rotate out), or keeping easy snacks on hand. When I was depressed I always had hummus and carrots in my fridge for something simple but still healthy to eat. Make it easy for yourself but still healthy options. Make sure you're taking a multivitamin and getting all the nutrients you need, and that you're drinking plenty of water (I dont recommend bottled water because its bad for the enviroment using all that plastic, invest in a good water filter for your home like Waterdrop or Berkey. Bring a Stanley cup or insulated bottle filled with water from home...I have my ""emotional support"" water bottle and making sure its cleaned and filled with water before work has helped me feel ""ready"" for the day) Taking a B vitamin complex is helpful for me, as are adaptogenic herbs (ashwagandha, rhodiola, holy basil) and magnesium has helped my mental state as well (if you're choosing the route of prescription antidepressants/anxiety medications, some of these supplements can interact so I would check with your prescriber first before taking anything other than the prescription meds). I recommend ""Calm powder"" magnesium you can get on Amazon for an oral supplement, and I use magnesium oil on my stomach and legs to help me sleep). We all are very low on magnesium and taking magnesium has helped me sleep better, and that helps my mental health as well...sleep is so important, have a bedtime of 10pm or whatever works for you where you won't be doomscrolling. Lastly, do something to spoil yourself. Maybe you need to book a massage and have your turn being pampered. Maybe you need a night in with a movie or a book. You could also schedule a day off where you sleep in and just have a normal day at home. But do something that you know you would enjoy. I have 2 dogs and take them for long walks every day, as its relaxing for both them and me. You've got this, and I promise there are better days ahead."

1lbq16b,2025-06-15 02:52:39,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Hi, my doctor has diagnosed me with Iron Deficiency Without Anemia (normal iron & hemoglobin levels, but extremely low ferritin levels) and has recommended I go forward with iron infusion therapy (I will be trying to get pregnant later in the year, so it's imperative that I get my levels up rapidly). I am overwhelmed/terrified by the stories I have read about bad reactions, like anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest (this is particularly touchy to me as my Dad died as a result of an allergic reaction to a medication administered during surgery leading to cardiac arrest). It also didn't help that the last time I was at my hematologist's office, someone rushed into the room needing my doctor ASAP as someone there was having a reaction to their infusion. I am currently being treated for Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS) with a regimen of 10mg cetirizine (Zyrtec - H1 blocker) 2x/day, 40mg famotidine (Pepcid - H2 blocker) 2x/day, and 1mg oral Ketotifen (mast cell stablizer) 2x/day. I also have some minor issues with methylation due to my MTHFR gene mutation, and prescribed 15mg L-Methylfolate (Deplin) daily, as well as a methylated B vitamin supplement. I also have been diagnosed with asthma, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS) & Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS). 1. Thoughts on/experiences with iron infusion brands? I'm leaning towards Feraheme or Monoferric (if they're available). Full disclosure, the black box warning for Infed scares me and the hypophosphatemia issues have scared me away from Injectafer. Ferrlecit & Venofer sound like they would take a lot longer--but do people tend to tolerate them better? 2. I have read that it's not good to take Benadryl before iron infusions--does this mean I should avoid taking any or all of the above listed antihistamines & mast cell stabilizer prior to infusion? Any pre-medication recommendations? 3. I've read that in the case of an anaphylactic reaction to an iron infusion, they will pump you with Benadryl. But allergists always say that if you're in anaphylaxis, Benadryl and other antihistamines are not good and instead you need epinephrine and to get to an ER. So which is it? *I know that I will get at least one response that emphasizes how rare reactions are. But I have so many health issues that I worry could pre-dispose me (including MCAS, which right now, I have allergic reactions to tons of things all the time), I just want to be prepared and make the most informed decision I can, and have a reliable plan in place, should something go wrong. Thank you so much in advance!"

my1w5h6,2025-06-16 09:27:36,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ >Most of the divide is described as self-inflicted by the humblefolk in the book. True, but not being the cause of the class divide doesn't mean that the class divide doesn't exist, its perpetuation is simply self-sustaining. I think the critique here is that this is a meta-textual problem from the writers, and not an error or oversight in the writing itself, so I'll try to tailor my rebuttal as approaching that point of view. Pulling from the Introduction in the setting Pg 8: >In the early years, the birdfolk and humblefolk lived close to each other in small villages around the forest. These isolated communities were vulnerable to an organization of brigands and marauders who called themselves the ""Bandit Coalition."" To protect themselves from the Coalition, the birdfolk built fortified cities in the forest's canopy. Joining forces with the humblefolk, the birdfolk army, known as the ""Perch Guard"", drove back the bandits, bringing peace and security to the region. Over time, birdfolk culture spread, and the capital city of Alderheart became the most politically influential place in the Wood. In the lore, the precipitating moment for the birdfolk fleeing to and building up canopy fortresses (and later cities) was the formation of the Bandit Coalition. And while the Bandit Coalition is described as being majority Humblefolk (please correct me here if I'm wrong), I believe those descriptions only come from contemporary in game sources in the setting, not its history. It is entirely plausible, and I argue the likelier situation, that the Bandit Coalition largely formed as a cosmopolitan body, evenly representing the different races. It is also likely that the Coalition simply opted to both recruit from and set their predations on the more available targets, the ones they would not have to climb trees (and likely split their forces to do so) to access. The Humblefolk  stayed on the ground, and they were more available targets. This is importance to note now, because this is where a race divide occurs. There are other reasons for this race divide, of course. The Amaranthine pantheon represents all the races, but only the birdfolk deities have written entries in the book that describe their origins, the Humblefolk deities are simply hand waved as **The humblefolk Amaranthine are less cohesive, with each having varied tales, origin myths, rather than a single origin story. ** It's important to note that though this seems lazy on the surface, it sets up the Humblefolk as possessing of a more mutable, potentially oral only mythology. The cultures of the Humblefolk and Birdfolk were already distinct well before the Bandit Coalition became a problem. This will be important later. >They fought amongst themselves and only found peace and unity through a treaty overseen by the birds. I offer the following: #From: Chapter 1: Welcome to the Wood-> Races of the Wood-> The Humblefolk >Ages ago, an accord was struck between the people of the forest floor to unite against roving bandits and quell the in-fighting that was wreaking havoc across the Wood. This accord was known as the ""Humblefolk Treaty"" and was witnessed by the birdfolk, who were just then beginning to shape the trunk of Alderheart. #From: Chapter 3: Traversing the Wood-> Alderheart >Birdfolk shapers spoke to the tallest and most ancient tree in the Wood‚ÄîAlderheart. The shapers obtained permission for birdfolk to build a home within Alderheart's branches. Later, the great tree again gave permission to shape its trunk into homes for an increasing population. This treaty seems to have been devised and signed by the Humblefolk just after most Birdfolk began migrating upwards and started developing Alderheart. Combined with the context of knowing that the Birdfolk migration was in response to the Bandit Coalition, and the fact that in the same passage it denotes that the Birdfolk had just begun to shape Alderheart's trunk (after they had already built a home in its branches), we can infer that the departure of Birdfolk was recent to the rise of the Bandit Coalition, but not so recent that the divide was already firmly entrenched in history. I surmise that the treaty was drafted and signed likely anywhere between most of a decade and many decades, but still within the same generation. This is important because while the Bandit Coalition was likely mostly a Humblefolk Agency by this point, it isn't necessarily so that it *started* as one. Other than that though, the Humblefolk treaty was signed by what essentially amounts to a confederation of communities, which by this point would have seen their demographics shift significantly to Humblefolk (to what degree we can only infer and guess), in response to a problem that was within living memory, a problem both for and made up of the Birdfolk and the Humblefolk. While the treaty was devised to provide mutual defence and aid amongst these communities , the Birdfolk were witnesses because a) Alderheart is roughly geographically centre in the wood and b) it represents neutral ground for the Humblefolk to gather. >With the expansion of the Humblefolk Treaty to allow humblefolk to call upon Perch Guard garrisons in times of crisis, and the birdfolk militias keeping the roads safe for merchant caravans, the Wood truly entered a golden age. Life for many humblefolk was peaceful and prosperous...until the fires came. The Birdfolk were witnesses because a more geopolitically stable forest floor represents a safer environment for their own society. They later became party to it in the Treaty's expansion because by providing security for merchant travel, they bolstered trade throughout the wood which would inevitably contribute to a booming economy in Alderheart. Additionally, the centralization of much of the body of Birdfolk society in one location meant that the Perch Guard were by far the largest militia amongst the Humblewood, and were the only such organization poised to provide an even distribution of security throughout the Wood's roads. The trade benefit guaranteed that they would always be able to keep their forces in supply. This also cemented Birdfolk as the common tongue. All was well, the bandits were suppressed, the infight and civil disputes between forest floor communities was mediated, and a golden age dawned. But all of that changed when the Fire ~~Nation~~ attacked. ##### Once again from Chapter 1: Welcome to the Wood-> Races of the Wood-> The Humblefolk >With the spreading flames, humblefolk villagers petitioned the overextended Perch Guard for aid, only to see help arrive too late, if at all.

my3pw9f,2025-06-16 16:16:39,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ TXA was invented in Japan (by a female physician in the 60s - interesting story) and there has been a lot of research on it there. If oral txa works for you, that's great. For some it causes side effects, in which case topical txa is a good alternative, and it has some other benefits. One problem is that many topical products with txa only have a small percentage. The positive studies almost always used 5% and I think 10% is even better. I suspect that the people who say topical txa didn't work for them were using a product with a low concentration. But there shouldn't be any difference between oral txa from Japan and that from other countries. It's not a difficult compound to synthesize. But I agree that other added ingredients can be good. Vitamin C makes sense. One reason I like NextLeap is that it combines 10% txa with complementary niacinamide (vitamin b) and copper peptide, another often overlooked ingredient with a lot of benefits."

my3yol5,2025-06-16 16:58:53,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Hi, I am a dentist! Impossible to tell you exactly without physically seeing you but it sounds like you have pericoronitis. The best thing to do is to buy a ‚Äúsafe ended syringe‚Äù (can get them on amazon or probably from a pharmacy too), fill it with saltwater or chlorhexidine (corsodyl) and rinse the gum around the wisdom tooth and especially under the flap of your wisdom tooth is only part way through. Often what happens is the gum swells up and becomes inflamed because of food getting trapped, and then you end up biting it and it swells up more and is a vicious cycle. You need to do this at least 3 times a day until it has cleared up and doesn't do any hard to keep doing it every so often in future to stop it coming back. Obviously it might not be this and this is just general advice based off what it sounds like, so if it doesn't clear up in a few days then ring 111 or try your luck calling round some local practices. Worst case, mydentist private emergencies are ¬£125 :) Edit: I missed the bit about your cheek peeling. Can more or less guarantee you're using an Oral B one as this is a common issue with it from my experience - just use another brand and it will stop lol"

3895570bcf2fa889e94cca4e564b5995,2025-06-16 19:31:00,en,WEB,"‚Äâ The first patient enrolled in a planned international clinical trial has been treated at HonorHealth Research Institute with a new type of immune therapy for those with a rare muscle-weakness disease known as Myasthenia Gravis. In an odd medical twist, this auto-immune disease - in which antibodies interfere with the connection between nerves and muscles - most often strikes young women in their 20s and 30s, and older men in their 60s and 70s, though it can affect others. The disease affects fewer than 200 in every 1 million people. Symptoms range from droopy eyelids, problems chewing, general fatigue, difficulty swallowing and even problems breathing when the muscles surrounding the lungs are weakened. Patients often find it difficult to conduct basic hygiene and grooming; things as simple as brushing their teeth, taking a shower and getting dressed. ""It's kind of exciting,"" said Anne Hatch, D.O., Principal Investigator for this international clinical trial (NTC06744920), which will consider the safety and effectiveness of a drug called Remibrutinib, manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceuticals of Basel, Switzerland. Dr. Hatch explained that, for the first time in this disease, the drug will target B cells, a type of white blood cell that makes antibodies. While usually an important part of the body's immune system, she said, in Myasthenia Gravis malfunctioning white blood cells interfere with the messaging between the nervous system and muscles in what is known as the neuro-muscular-junction pathway. This new drug blocks a different part of the pathway than before. Hopefully, with this new mechanism of action, the patient's symptoms will improve. "" Anne Hatch, D.O., Principal Investigator for international clinical trial NTC06744920 This new drug blocks a different part of the pathway than before. Hopefully, with this new mechanism of action, the patient's symptoms will improve."" Anne Hatch, D.O., Principal Investigator for international clinical trial NTC06744920 If successful, this Phase III clinical trial could lead to the drug being approved by the FDA for Myasthenia Gravis . The treatment has already been approved for some types of cancer. Trial participants must be 18-75 years old with a confirmed diagnosis of Myasthenia Gravis. They must be able to breathe without a respirator and be able to safely swallow the oral medication. A Patient's progress could be followed for up to 5 years.

my5u3as,2025-06-16 22:22:40,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Yes brush your tongue or use a scraper daily. Huge for reducing oral bacteria. Oral B is much better than Sonicare imo but whatever you use, don't apply pressure onto the tooth with it, just rest it lightly. You can flip the TB head vertically to help fit into those spaces, if the guy is a periodontist no need to be skeptical you can adopt his tips and benefit. He's not being weird, I often have to tip my brush like that in the front teeth, the key is to make sure the toothbrush bristle is touching your gum tissue gently so basically whatever you have to do to attain that. The shape of the oral B is round so it might reach those areas for you without causing such a mess. I order the Nimbus on Amazon, it comes with a few in one pack I think. Periodontists like manual brushes because they are harder to hurt yourself with. Most people are too heavy handed with electric. Hygienists and dentists like electric because they typically do a better job of cleaning than manual. Two schools of thought, two valid viewpoints. Work with your hygienist to see what gives the best results for you."

FNP-223, a new molecular entity in active development for PSP, is in an ongoing Phase 2 study to evaluate its safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics in adult patients with possible or probable PSP-Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS), the most common clinical variant of this neurodegenerative disease1. ""We are thrilled to receive Fast Track designation from the FDA for FNP-223 in the treatment of PSP. Consistent with our purpose of using business to fight for social justice, we are committed to advancing this promising therapy as quickly as possible to benefit as many patients as possible,"" said Mario Rovirosa, Chief Executive Officer of Ferrer. Fast Track designation is a significant milestone in the drug development process. It is a program that offers the possibility of having more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the drug's development, eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review if relevant criteria are met. ""This designation underscores the importance of expediting the development and review of FNP-223 to address critical unmet needs in patients with this rare and devastating disease,"" said Marta Parmar, Ferrer's Chief Quality, Regulatory and Pharmacovigilance Officer. Progressive supranuclear palsy manifests in patients with symptoms such as difficulty speaking, imbalance, changes in gait, cognitive problems2-4. PSP has a prevalence of approximately 5 cases per 100,000 people and primarily affects individuals over the age of 603. The disease's etiology is believed to be related to the abnormal accumulation of tau proteins in certain areas of the brain, leading to neurodegeneration3,4. Preclinical models have demonstrated that FNP-223 can prevent the abnormal accumulation of tau proteins in neurons5. Ferrer now aims to show that this molecule is safe and effective in patients with PSP. Oscar P√©rez, Chief Scientific Officer of Ferrer, also expressed his enthusiasm: ""Receiving Fast Track designation is a significant milestone in our journey to provide a transformative treatment for PSP. We are excited to advance our research and hopefully offer a new therapeutic option earlier for patients living with this challenging condition."" About FNP-223 FNP-223 is a new orally administered chemical compound that functions as a reversible and substrate-competitive inhibitor of the O-GlcNAcase (OGA) enzyme5. Mechanistically, FNP-223 binds to the active site of OGA enzyme. As a result, the inhibitor prevents the substrate from accessing the catalytic pocket, thereby impeding the removal of O-GlcNAc modifications from natural client proteins such as the tau protein. Inhibiting O-GlcNAcase is expected to cause a rapid increase of O-GlcNAcylated (glycosylated) tau proteins, ultimately leading to a reduction in abnormal aggregated tau as neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) over a certain period5.

mov_18BA4EFBEF5C17EE3E5C3E7FEDFFEF12,2025-06-17 10:01:55,en,WEB,"‚Äâ SAN FRANCISCO (AP) ‚Äî A federal appeals court in San Francisco is scheduled to hear arguments Tuesday on whether the Trump administration should return control of National Guard troops to California after they were deployed following protests in Los Angeles over immigration raids. The hearing comes after the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals granted a request by the administration last week to temporarily pause a lower court order that directed President Donald Trump to return control of the soldiers to the governor who filed a lawsuit over the deployment. The three-judge panel is set to hear oral arguments via video starting at noon, and protests outside the downtown San Francisco court are expected. U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco ruled last week that the Guard deployment was illegal and exceeded Trump's statutory authority. It applied only to the National Guard troops and not the Marines, who were also deployed to LA. The Trump administration argued the deployment was necessary to restore order and protect federal buildings and officers. In his lawsuit, Gov.

C. Macro-level ‚Äì Adoption of peptide-based regenerative therapies ‚Ä¢ Potential impact on Market: Expanded product pipelines, shaping industry trends and industry size projections. Impact of Geopolitical Situation on Supply Chain The 2024 Russia‚ÄìUkraine conflict disrupted exports of plant-derived keratin precursors critical for advanced hair loss treatment formulations. European and North American manufacturers experienced shipment delays of up to eight weeks, triggering a 12% surge in production costs. Several market players established dual-sourcing agreements with India and Brazil, mitigating supply disruption and stabilizing hair loss treatment market size. This geopolitical strain underscores the market challenge of over-reliance on single-source suppliers, prompting broader supply chain resilience strategies. These shifts are recalibrating market dynamics, influencing market share allocations, and accelerating investments in regional manufacturing hubs to secure uninterrupted product availability. SWOT Analysis Strengths ‚Ä¢ Strong R&D capabilities: Merck & Co. and Aclaris Therapeutics invested over USD 120 Mn in JAK-inhibitor trials in 2024, reinforcing competitive market drivers. ‚Ä¢ Diversified product portfolio: Combination therapies (oral + topical) captured 18% of industry share in North America by mid-2025. ‚Ä¢ Alignment with personalized medicine: AI-driven diagnostics are setting new hair loss treatment market trends, enhancing patient outcomes. Weaknesses ‚Ä¢ High cost of novel therapies limits penetration in price-sensitive regions, acting as a key market restraint. ‚Ä¢ Regulatory heterogeneity across markets extends approval timelines, increasing time-to-market by an average of six months. ‚Ä¢ Limited granular market analysis at the micro-clinic level hinders precise market segmentation and targeted growth strategies. Opportunities ‚Ä¢ Aging populations in Latin America and Southeast Asia present unmet demand, expanding market scope for injectable and oral treatments. ‚Ä¢ Tele-dermatology and e-commerce channels can unlock rural market segments, driving innovative market growth strategies. ‚Ä¢ Partnerships with biotech firms for peptide-based therapeutics could accelerate product launches, boosting industry trends. Threats ‚Ä¢ Patent expirations on key compounds (e.g., Finasteride) in 2025 may intensify generic competition and erode hair loss treatment market share. ‚Ä¢ Evolving safety regulations following rare adverse events could impose additional compliance costs and delay approvals. ‚Ä¢ Economic downturns may constrain healthcare budgets, limiting patient access and dampening market revenue growth. Key Players Viviscal; Cipla Inc.; Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.; Merck & Co., Inc.; Daiichi-Sankyo Co.; copyright Inc.; Johnson & Johnson; Concert Pharmaceuticals; Dr. Reddy's Laboratories; L'Or√©al Group; Honma Tokyo; Fidia Farmaceutici; ScalpMED; Histogen Inc.; Regaine; Galderma; Biofrontera. ‚Ä¢ In 2024, Merck & Co. partnered with a South Korean biotech to co-develop next-gen topical kinase inhibitors, reducing development time by 20%. ‚Ä¢ Aclaris Therapeutics secured a USD 75 Mn series C investment in early 2025 to scale AI-powered diagnostic platforms, projected to increase clinic adoption by 30%. ‚Ä¢ Viviscal expanded manufacturing capacity in Brazil in 2025, stabilizing costs and improving time-to-market across Latin America...."

FNP-223, a new molecular entity in active development for PSP, is in an ongoing Phase 2 study to evaluate its safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics in adult patients with possible or probable PSP-Richardson syndrome (PSP-RS), the most common clinical variant of this neurodegenerative disease1. ""We are thrilled to receive Fast Track designation from the FDA for FNP-223 in the treatment of PSP. Consistent with our purpose of using business to fight for social justice, we are committed to advancing this promising therapy as quickly as possible to benefit as many patients as possible,"" said Mario Rovirosa , Chief Executive Officer of Ferrer. Fast Track designation is a significant milestone in the drug development process. It is a program that offers the possibility of having more frequent meetings with the FDA to discuss the drug's development, eligibility for Accelerated Approval and Priority Review if relevant criteria are met. ""This designation underscores the importance of expediting the development and review of FNP-223 to address critical unmet needs in patients with this rare and devastating disease,"" said Marta Parmar , Ferrer's Chief Quality, Regulatory and Pharmacovigilance Officer. Progressive supranuclear palsy manifests in patients with symptoms such as difficulty speaking, imbalance, changes in gait, cognitive problems2-4. PSP has a prevalence of approximately 5 cases per 100,000 people and primarily affects individuals over the age of 603. The disease's etiology is believed to be related to the abnormal accumulation of tau proteins in certain areas of the brain, leading to neurodegeneration3,4. Preclinical models have demonstrated that FNP-223 can prevent the abnormal accumulation of tau proteins in neurons5. Ferrer now aims to show that this molecule is safe and effective in patients with PSP. Oscar PeÃÅrez , Chief Scientific Officer of Ferrer, also expressed his enthusiasm: ""Receiving Fast Track designation is a significant milestone in our journey to provide a transformative treatment for PSP. We are excited to advance our research and hopefully offer a new therapeutic option earlier for patients living with this challenging condition."" About FNP-223 FNP-223 is a new orally administered chemical compound that functions as a reversible and substrate-competitive inhibitor of the O-GlcNAcase (OGA) enzyme5. Mechanistically, FNP-223 binds to the active site of OGA enzyme. As a result, the inhibitor prevents the substrate from accessing the catalytic pocket, thereby impeding the removal of O-GlcNAc modifications from natural client proteins such as the tau protein. Inhibiting O-GlcNAcase is expected to cause a rapid increase of O-GlcNAcylated (glycosylated) tau proteins, ultimately leading to a reduction in abnormal aggregated tau as neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) over a certain period5.

I actually stayed up very late last night reading and trying to understand more about it. There still don't seem to be great guidelines for progesterone sensitivity. Looked at the Australian Menopause Society guidelines and the British society ones. I'm also considering the combined patch with norethindrone. Just so scared I react in the same way as I did to levonorgestrel. I'm still not sure about Angelique. It may also be my plan B, D, E, whatever. Right now I'm leaning towards low dose Oestrogel (bioidentical estradiol gel) and 100 mg Utrogestan (micronized progesterone) used vaginally. It seems there is some evidence that the vaginal route doesn't come with as severe side effects as oral Utrogestan.

Barrows STEM Academy presented their capstone research projects at Eastern Connecticut State University on June 6. The event was held in the Student Center and its presenters covered a plethora of sustainability challenges and controversies through poster sessions and oral presentations. According to Barrows teacher Christian B. Kolleger, each issue that the students selected was in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG) and covered topics such as socioeconomic challenges and environmental awareness to later turn into a final essay. ‚ÄúIt was ideal to base our capstone work on them as they are broad and include a lot of opportunities for different types of investigation and problem solving, which are skills that we really prioritize our students having,‚Äù said Kolleger. ‚ÄúStudents explore the UNSDG then pick a specific area of concern that resonates with them, and then they then spend time researching to understand the problem as fully as they can.‚Äù Kolleger explained that part of the assignment was to study issues close to home, this year expanding the learning territory to Puerto Rico since some students have family there. Students focused on a variety of issues affecting the territory. ‚ÄúNotable projects included the challenging electrical systems of the island, homelessness, the likely extinct golden coqu√≠ (frog), and the iguaca parrot (Puerto Rican amazon, a species of bird),‚Äù said Kolleger. He continued: ‚ÄúOther outstanding projects this year included the Kemp's Ridley turtle, suicide, substance abuse (the fentanyl epidemic), poaching, and internalized misogyny. The students were highlighted in visual presentations in the Student Center Theater.‚Äù Patty Szczys, executive director of Eastern's Institute for Sustainability, explained that the school's collaboration with Barrows STEM Academy was fitting given Eastern's 25-year commitment to community outreach. ‚ÄúEach year I come away from these presentations having learned something new, and having the chance to interact with these young people renews my confidence for our shared future,‚Äù said Szczys. ‚ÄúI was impressed to see these students using critical thinking and problem-solving skills when proposing solutions to society's most pressing issues.‚Äù Written by Elisabeth Craig"

FULL TEXT An LGBTQ+ history project exhibited last year at the Lynn Museum received a top honor from a national organization celebrating local history. ""Through a Rainbow Lens"" received the Albert B. Corey Award, a national prize for excellence in local history, awarded by the American Association of State and Local History. The multimedia project by local nonprofit United Lynn Pride combines extensive archival research and the oral histories of 32 residents to map the North Shore city's LGBTQ+ roots. The association selected it for the prize, the organization's highest, ""from among the most impressive"" all-volunteer projects it honored this year. ""AASLH sees this project as a model for the public history field,"" said spokesperson Aja Bain. ""It is a wonderful example of a community-driven project that preserves and interprets marginalized history that also speaks to the needs of today's city."" ""The fact that this story is told in Lynn is important,"" added Gavin Kleespies, the regional chair for AASLH in northern New England. ""Queer history is also a part of hard-scrabble industrial towns and immigrant communities."" Part of the project is now on view at Lynn City Hall, with a version also archived online. A documentary based on the project will be screened for free at 6 p.m. on Friday  at EmVision Studios at 131 Essex St., Lynn. In an interview, project director Jim Moser said he was ""surprised and elated"" to receive the award. ""I just feel a lot of pride for the team we had. We did a really good job and it's nice we're getting national recognition. And it merits recognition,"" he added. ""In this current climate, I think it's important that an LGBTQ+ project won this year."" Moser said preserving history is vital not just for remembering the past, but for confronting the future, especially as the LGBTQ+ community continues to face challenges. ""It's important to document our history, because if we don't, somebody else might, or it might be forgotten, or it might be erased,"" he said. For example, he noted that some federal materials the team used - including content from the National Park Service - are no longer available online. ""We can't relax, we can't take for granted the rights that we've gained because they can be repealed."" Moser also spoke about Lynn's once-thriving gay bar scene, which the exhibit highlights as a a hub of ""solidarity"" and ""organization."" While such spaces became less essential over time, their absence, he said, left a gap in collective resistance. ""There's a real resolve that we need to pull together again,"" he said. ""The people we interviewed were saying... even though we don't have the bars, we can still meet, we can organize in other ways."" Moser said the project balances celebration with the truth of pain and struggle. Lynn's history includes several LGBTQ+ firsts-like the Light House Caf√©, believed to be Massachusetts' first gay bar, and the first same-sex marriage license in the US. But it also includes accounts of violence, discrimination, and survival. ""Knowing how bad it was can also motivate us to protect what we've gained,"" he explained. ""It's important [that we can] get national exposure, so other people can share in our pride in the past and our concerns for the future."""

THIS IS AN ANNOUNCEMENT UNDER RULE 2.4 OF THE IRISH TAKEOVER PANEL ACT, 1997, TAKEOVER RULES, 2022 (THE ""IRISH TAKEOVER RULES"" OR THE""RULES"") AND IS NOT AN ANNOUNCEMENT OF A FIRM INTENTION TO MAKE AN OFFER UNDER RULE 2.7 OF THE IRISH TAKEOVER RULES. THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT ANY FIRM OFFER WILL BE MADE, NOR AS TO THE TERMS ON WHICH ANY SUCH OFFER WILL BE MADE. THIS ANNOUNCEMENT CONTAINS INSIDE INFORMATION. 19 June 2025 Kenmare Resources plc (""Kenmare"" or""the Company"" or""the Group"") Termination of Offer Discussions with Consortium Kenmare Resources plc (LSE:KMR, ISE:KMR), one of the leading global producers of titanium minerals and zircon, which operates the Moma Titanium Minerals Mine (the ""Mine"" or ""Moma"") in northern Mozambique, announces that it has terminated offer discussions with Oryx Global Partners Limited and Michael Carvill (together, the""Consortium""). Statement from Andrew Webb, Chairman of Kenmare: ""Kenmare supported the Consortium in its due diligence process and gave the possible offer extensive consideration, despite its early stage and unsolicited nature. The Board will continue to review all opportunities to create significant long-term value for all of our stakeholders, including our shareholders. We are highly confident in Kenmare's prospects as an independent company and its ability to deliver on its strategic and operational objectives. Moma is one of the world's largest titanium minerals deposits, with a multi-decade mine life, a consistent low-cost profile, and substantial inherent value. Kenmare remains on track to achieve its 2025 production guidance and has a strong order book for H2 2025. The Wet Concentrator Plant A upgrade project continues to progress to plan, with commissioning on track to begin in Q3 2025, ahead of the plant's transition to the large Nataka ore zone. Mining in Nataka will secure long-term production from Moma and will support the Company's ability to generate strong cash flow throughout the commodity price cycle. Discussions with the Government of Mozambique are continuing regarding the extension of the Implementation Agreement and our Managing Director, Tom Hickey, was pleased to meet with the President of Mozambique last week to discuss the Company's history, significant investments and future plans in the country."" Background to possible offer On 6 March 2025, the Board of Kenmare confirmed that it had received a non-binding proposal from the Consortium regarding a possible all cash offer for the entire issued and to be issued ordinary share capital of Kenmare. The discussions with the Consortium were announced in response to media speculation, after Kenmare had received unsolicited, preliminary and conditional proposals from the Consortium. The most recent proposal received from the Consortium prior to the announcement by the Company on 6 March 2025 had been made at a price of 530 pence per Kenmare ordinary share (the""Initial Proposal""). The Board of Kenmare, together with its advisers, considered the terms of the Initial Proposal and unanimously rejected it on the basis that it undervalued Kenmare's business and its prospects. However, in order to facilitate the Consortium improving the financial terms of the Initial Proposal, the Company offered to provide the Consortium with access to limited due diligence information. Since 6 March 2025, Kenmare has continued discussions with the Consortium and has provided additional due diligence information, which also supported the Consortium's ability to progress its discussions with potential financing partners. In addition, the Company engaged with the Consortium on the terms and conditions of its proposal and other related matters. During Kenmare's most recent engagement with the Consortium, it was made clear by the Consortium that it would only be willing to proceed with an offer at pricing substantially below the Initial Proposal (the""Revised Pricing""). The Revised Pricing was subject, inter alia, to a request for an additional period of due diligence to conclude financing and other arrangements. The Board of Kenmare, together with its advisers, considered the Revised Pricing and unanimously rejected it on the basis that it significantly undervalued Kenmare's business and its prospects. Accordingly, the Board of Kenmare has unanimously determined that it is not in the best interests of Kenmare shareholders to seek an extension to the deadline set out in the Company's announcement dated 15 May 2025, as permitted by Rule 2.6(c) of the Irish Takeover Rules, and, consequently, it has terminated all discussions with the Consortium. As stated in the Company's announcement dated 15 May 2025, in accordance with Rule 2.6(c) of the Irish Takeover Rules, the Consortium is required by no later than 5.00 pm on 20 June 2025, to either announce a firm intention to make an offer for Kenmare in accordance with Rule 2.7 of the Irish Takeover Rules or announce that it does not intend to make an offer for Kenmare, in which case the announcement would be treated as a statement to which Rule 2.8 of the Irish Takeover Rules applies. This announcement is made without the prior agreement or approval of the Consortium. There can be no certainty that a firm offer will be made, or as to the terms of any such offer, should one be made.

Unlike conventional pharmacies that dispense standardized, mass-produced pharmaceuticals, compounding pharmacies formulate bespoke medications by combining, altering, or adjusting pharmaceutical-grade ingredients based on specific patient requirements. While pharmaceutical compounding is a long-established practice, its relevance has grown in contemporary healthcare due to its ability to address cases where commercially available medications are unsuitable. Compounded formulations are commonly prescribed when patients require alternative dosages, have allergies to certain excipients, or present with medical conditions that necessitate personalized treatment. These preparations can be delivered in various dosage forms, such as suppositories, creams, ointments, tablets, lozenges, and oral suspensions, offering valuable solutions in pediatric, geriatric, veterinary, and complex therapeutic contexts. The compounding pharmacy market is expanding steadily, supported by a combination of demographic and clinical trends. Key growth drivers include the rising incidence of chronic illnesses, an aging global population, and a growing preference for individualized medicine. In addition, increased collaboration among healthcare providers, regulatory support for personalized therapies, and the development of innovative compounding techniques are contributing to the market's continued advancement.

Data from the study demonstrate that type B gelatin and BSA can be used as inexpensive supplements for improving cell viability in electrotransfer.Amantadine has recently been shown to improve patients with COVID-19. In addition to its known mechanism of actions, we performed docking prediction of this drug on the receptor-binding domain of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2. We hypothesize that such interaction may possibly have contributed a role in the clinical improvements reported.Deactivation of primed SARS-CoV-2 prior to cell entry constitutes an emergency brake in COVID-19 infection if vaccine-induced antibodies fail to block recognition of the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) receptor. The timing and locus for the therapeutic intervention are dictated by the cell entry mechanism and by the selective advantage of the dominant D614G mutation.Traditionally, vertebrate models have been utilized and are viewed as more pertinent; however, we propose the application of an invertebrate model such as locusts to study human disease and sickness behavior at an early phase of research. This model has numerous benefits, namely, expense, swiftness, procedural convenience, and ethical acceptance. For example, the injection of immunogen-induced anorexia behavior in rats and locusts in vivo are analogous. Moreover, the presence of a brain barrier in locusts reveals remarkable similarities in molecular methods utilized by E. coli K1 to traverse the central nervous system of rats and locusts, consequently providing a worthwhile model to investigate pathogenesis. The presence of cytokines in these insects and presence of a brain barrier (which is physiologically relevant to human blood-brain barrier) makes it a relevant model in determining disease mechanisms and invasion of the brain by central nervous system pathogens. [This corrects the article DOI 10.1021/acsptsci.0c00003.] . The eye and eyesight are exquistly designed and are precious, and yet we often take them for granted. Good vision is critical for our long-term survival and for humanity's enduring progress. Unfortunately, since ocular diseases do not culminate in life-and-death scenarios, awareness of the plight of millions of people suffering from such eye ailments is not publicized as other diseases. However, losing eyesight or falling victim to visual impairment is a frightening outlook for most people. Glaucoma, a collection of chronic optic neuropathies, of which the most prevalent form, primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), is the second leading cause of irreversible blindness. POAG currently afflicts >70 million people worldwide and is an insidious, progressive, silent thief of sight that is asymptomatic. On the other hand, allergic conjunctivitis (AC), and the associated rhinitis (""hay-fever""), frequently victimizes a huge number of people worldwide, especially during seasonal changes. While not life-threatening, sufferers of AC soon learn the value of drugs to treat their signs and symptoms of AC as they desire rapid relief to overcome the ocular itching/pain, redness, and tearing AC causes. Herein, I will describe the collective efforts of many researchers whose industrious, diligent, and dedicated team work resulted in the discovery, biochemical/pharmacological characterization, development and eventual launch of drugs to treat AC (e.g., olopatadine [Patanol/Pataday/Pazeo] and emedastine [Emedine]), and for treating ocular hypertension and POAG (e.g., travoprost [Travatan ] and Simbrinza). This represents a personal perspective.We report the relaxation of methacholine-constricted airways with nebulized MIDD0301, a positive allosteric Œ≥-aminobutyric acid type A receptor (GABAAR) modulator. The therapeutic efficacy of nebulized MIDD0301 in reducing airway resistance was investigated in spontaneous breathing mice using a whole-body plethysmograph and in unconscious mice using a forced oscillation technique. Prophylactic nebulized MIDD0301 reduced subsequent methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction in ovalbumin and house dust mite allergic asthma models and in normal mice. Nebulized MIDD0301 exhibited comparable or better therapeutic potency compared to nebulized albuterol and oral montelukast. GSK1325756 Prophylactic nebulized MIDD0301 was also effective in reducing bronchoconstriction, comparable to nebulized albuterol or fluticasone, in a steroid resistant asthma mouse model induced by intratracheal installation of lipopolysaccharide and interferon-gamma. Oral dexamethasone was ineffective in this model. Nebulized MIDD0301 was also effective in reversing bronchospasm when dosed after methacholine challenge comparable to albuterol. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that about 0.06% of nebulized MIDD0301 entered the mouse lung when using a whole body plethysmograph and therapeutic levels were sustained in the lung for at least 25 min. Consistent with previous reports on orally dosed MIDD0301, high doses of nebulized MIDD0301 resulted in minimal brain exposure and thus no observable adverse sensorimotor or respiratory depression effects occurred. In addition, no adverse cardiovascular effects were observed following 100 mg/kg i.p. dosing. These results further demonstrate that charged imidazodiazepine MIDD0301 can selectively target lung GABAAR without adverse motor, cardiovascular, or respiratory effects and inhaled dosing is effective in reducing bronchoconstriction in allergen and infectious lung inflammation.Kidney calcification increases the risk of chronic kidney disease. However, to date, renal calcium phosphate crystallization, a main initiating and driving factor of kidney calcification, has not been explored as a drug target. Pre-clinical drug development is hampered by limited knowledge on the broad range of kidney calcification disorders, characterized by a multifactorial process of disease progression. In this work, we first established an in vitro calcification profiling platform to accelerate pre-clinical drug discovery. The image-based profiling assay allowed the rapid testing of several ionic stimuli and/or inhibitory molecules. We then leveraged a previously established library of inositol hexakisphosphate analogues to identify a renal calcium phosphate inhibitor. A lead compound showed in vitro and in vivo efficacy to prevent calcium phosphate-induced kidney damage. In conclusion, this work reports a renal calcium phosphate inhibitor that could efficiently reduce kidney damage and emphasizes the utility and translational value of the in vitro calcification platform."

The first is that of the lost sheep and the lost coin; the second that of the prodigal son, the loving father and the unhappy elder brother. Please do read Luke 15: 1 - 10. There is one obvious problem with the story of the lost sheep: would a shepherd really leave 99 sheep in wild country? Probably not. But a flock of that many sheep would need more than one shepherd so he would not be leaving them alone. It is important to note that the one who went searching was the owner and therefore comparatively rich. Question 1: Sheep are smelly animals. What is suggested by the carrying on the shoulders? And by taking it home and not back to the flock? As so often Jesus is emphasising that he is interested not just in the smug posh people who thought they alone mattered but the ordinary people, the country people, the working people. He is taking the sheep home to show that everybody is welcome in his Kingdom. Question 2: What are the similarities and deliberate contrasts that make it reasonable to call this (v 1-10) a double parable rather than two separate parables? Most of the verbal contrasts are obvious. But don't miss the careful balancing of a story about a man with one about a woman. This is typical Luke. All too many parts of the church world-wide have not come to terms with the way Jesus treated women on equality with men. The two parables are set in a strictly male world and a strictly female world yet they carry the same message. They go together hence I call them a double parable. Question 3: How does the double parable answer the 'mutterings' of v 2? What was the main contrast between the world in which Jesus lived and the one he is describing? What does this contrast say to our present day situation? It answers the mutterings by contradicting the ideas on which they were based. The posh people were not interested in the other people. They did not see everybody as their neighbour. We need to look at our own attitudes and those of our church very carefully and very honestly to make sure we are not like those people. The second double parable is perhaps the greatest short story ever told. Please read 15: 11 - 32. This is where the idea of a reflection that I mentioned earlier becomes really important to understand what Jesus was saying - or rather the importance of what he did not say. Both parts of the double parable are reflections. The first goes like this: a. son lost b. sin - everything lost c. rejection d. change of mind - inadequately e. acceptance f. repentance - everything gained g. son found Question 4: Is what I have just said correct? I said it started with the son being lost and ended with the son being found. Should it rather be ""the father's loss"" and ""the father's gain""? And I might add, if so, might that change the title of the story - a question we will leave until we have looked at all the story. One commentator makes the following frequently overlooked points about that society and culture:  A man was expected to give an oral will only when dying, as Jacob did in Gen 48 so the boy was effectively asking his father to die! To break with convention like that would have merited a beating. It was undignified for an elderly man to run. He wouldn't! But this one did. The father's kiss of welcome and greeting outside the local village stopped the villagers mocking the despised son as they would naturally have done otherwise. A calf was killed. A sheep would have done. The elder son would have been expected to act as the reconciler in the family dispute. Question 5: Was the father properly even-handed to his sons? That is as hard a question to answer as any. I think it will depend on who we are how we answer that one. I would say - doubtful. But it is only a parable. The second part is nearly a reflection: a. elder brother comes b. he is told his brother has arrived c. his father attempts reconciliation d. he complains - how you treat me e. He complains - how you treat him f. his father attempts reconciliation g. he is again told brother has arrived h. ????..."

That's basically the beginning and ending of what is thought to be ‚Äútrue‚Äù about the person in question, the rest mostly being first and second century fictions to align the historical person with the messianic ‚Äúprophecy‚Äù (lots of which was also kind of retrofitted to align to a more ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù narrative, such as Isaiah 7:14 being understood to say that a virgin would conceive‚Äîtho arguably ‚Äúvirgins‚Äù get pregnant all the the time, but they aren't ‚Äúvirgins‚Äù at that point‚Äîand and give birth to the messiah; that interpretation isn't supported by more reasoned translations of the text). Other inventions include birth in Bethlehem, a census being the reason for the donkey-holiday trek, genealogical linkage to the line of David, the Magi, among many (many) others. Many of the ‚Äúsayings‚Äù of Jesus are **probably** reasonably aligned to reality, but full ‚Äúsermons‚Äù are almost certainly cobbled together by the authors of the gospels and Acts. Moreover, many of the things we think we know about the life and work and background of the man, turn out to be [much] later misinterpretations that took hold and persisted to modern theology and dogma‚Äînot really the place for this particular line of inquiry, but I will share one that I recently learned and found fascinating: the principle of immaculate conception is not about Jesus's conception at all; it's actually a dogmatic concept that was applied to MARY because her conception ‚Äúhad to be‚Äù ‚Äúimmaculate‚Äù so that Jesus could be born without original sin.

mov_67FF7C6435FCBB2E587E9E4D01AAF0FD,2025-06-19 21:06:44,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Book L'arnin' By Fred Pruitt Short Q & A ‚Äì Q: What about reading Christian books? A: When I was a new Christian, our pastor forbade the reading of Christian books to those who were in his full-time program. (Too much to explain at this point.) I have been a voracious reader my whole life. I give my mother the credit for signing me up to the summer reading program at the local library during school summer vacation when I was 7. Even in high school, though I wasn't too thrilled about the books we were required to read, I continued to read other books, a lot of them having to do with spiritual or occult things, being that was all the rage in the mid 60s. When I was a ‚Äúhippie‚Äù for about 3 years, I still read novels and then began exclusively reading ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù stuff, mostly Hinduism and then finally landing and practicing Zen Buddhism, while constantly reading books. From the time I first knew the Lord until we joined our first ‚ÄúBible‚Äù church by moving from Georgia to California, there was a six month gap. During that time I read a lot of the current crop of Christian books, mostly Charismatic. But when we arrived in CA the Pastor said no more books (and during that time I had no desire to read a ‚Äúworldly‚Äù book), I put them aside. That stopped for 7 years except for one time Pastor had me read a book by Pat Robertson, Shout It From the Housetops, the story of the origin of the 700 Club. Interestingly, in the book, one chapter talks about Pat meeting up with Norman Grubb. Pat (who was the son of a US Senator) having just graduated from Law school, now was ‚Äúoffering his services‚Äù to the Lord through WEC. Norman told him they didn't need him and his services and sent him on his way, which was quite pivotal for Robertson, because it set in motion the events that led to the 700 Club. Funny how God threw Norman at me there, huh? But boy, did I thirst to read books! Pastor had a large library in his office, with every Christian book imaginable in there, and I assumed he had read every one of them. Apparently he wanted to be our only ‚Äúfilter,‚Äù so they were off-limits to us, but not to him. He had everybody, all the old 19th and early 20th century stuff anyway ‚Äì Murray, Moody, Oswald Chambers, F. B. Meyer, Smith Wigglesworth, Oral Roberts, Torrey, Tozer, and two or three NPG's, too, Rees Howells and C. T. Studd and maybe one or two more! I remember every time I was in his office I lusted after his books, but never during those years did I read anything not authorized. Never broke the rule. So when we got out of there and not long after discovered union life, I could not read books fast enough again. And like every UL newbie, I instantly felt the ‚Äúdifference,‚Äù when an otherwise ‚Äúgood‚Äù book turned to self-effort at the end to make it all work. You just don't want to read stuff like that anymore. Unfortunately, quite a few babies go out with that bath water, because a lot of those people have some very good and important things to say, and said them and do say them still, by the Spirit, though God may have yet to bring them through to a full apprehension and being apprehended by Rom 8:2. We can't make others responsible for what they do not yet know. But it's right for us to ‚Äúgo out from them‚Äù for a while, as the Spirit leads, so we can get our own bearings in our union in Christ. As a caveat, I do rankle a bit that folks seem so quick to throw all their past ‚Äúhistory‚Äù in Christ onto the dump heap. Including the people who are still involved in that dump heap, and begin to ‚Äúpreach‚Äù AT the people still on the dump heap, not by telling them who they are, but by pointing out how wrong they are and they're evil legalists etc. etc. We may have only been ‚Äúevil legalists‚Äù just yesterday ourselves, and when we were just the same as them yesterday, we were still beloved of the Lord and held in Him without sin, and we walked in faith in that level while we were in it, and even then were Christ walking around though mostly unconscious of it. Who shall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that justifieth. 34 Who is he that condemneth? It is Christ that died, yea rather, that is risen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who also maketh intercession for us. 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? (Rom 8)  Our Pastor, back in the long-ago days of the 1970s, a great teacher and preacher, would often get into the Romans 8 scripture above in his closing. He must've seen it in his spirit, because we were all edified greatly by it, but most of us had little understanding of what this meant. Even though it was preached, it was a challenge to actually believe it! Anyway, back to books. For my early years in union I did an awful lot of reading, every book that came around. From those restricted days, to the freedom I began to know in the Spirit to read anything that interested me (still talking spiritual stuff mostly) especially some of the older Christian mystics, Meister Eckhart, Tauler, Ruysbroek, St Teresa, Madame Guyon and others to the German mystical writer Jacob Boehme and the Anglican mystical writer, William Law, Pierre de Chardin, Walter Lanyon, and lots of Thomas Merton. And then one day I threw it all out again. I got rid of almost all the books. Just live and let it all percolate. For about a decade. I became content to feed the catfish in the pond behind the mobile home we were renting out in the country. We saw the comet out there in 97. And then a full eclipse of the moon another night. I tried a big garden but gave up after the deer ate everything one night. A formerly owned but turned out to the wild horse lived in our woods nearby...."

Carers' quality of life need to be improved and support programmes, devised and delivered by nurses, could have a role in this.Sam Foster, Chief Nurse, Oxford University Hospitals, considers the idea that rudeness and incivility can have a real impact on not only team working but also on patient safety.John Fowler, Educational Consultant, explores academic writing.Vasculitis is a relatively rare and poorly understood condition causing inflammation of the blood vessels, which in turn can affect a patient's respiratory and renal systems. In some cases, ocular involvement can cause loss of sight and hearing loss may also be a red flag for vasculitis, which, if not treated early, can cause complete hearing loss. Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (AAV) is a group comprising granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and eosinophilic granulomatosis (EGP). AAV is fatal if untreated and as increased risk escalates with age, coupled with a decline in renal function, these are the principal predictors of poor outcome. Vital roles for nursing vasculitis patients lie in managing inflammation and pain, as these distressing symptoms are prevalent in the disease. Because of the multiple complications that can occur with vasculitis, treatment-related information is a high priority for these patients. As nurses are well placed to deliver information, value lies in their role in reducing the negative impacts on treatment regimens and compliance that accompany patients' poor insight into their condition.John Tingle, Lecturer in Law, Birmingham Law School, University of Birmingham, discusses some recent patient safety reports and how they can help better inform care and quality practices across the NHS.Emeritus Professor Alan Glasper, from the University of Southampton, discusses polices and reports designed to alert health professionals to deteriorating mental health among children and young people.This article provides the reader with an outline of the anatomy and physiology of the lacrimal system and illustrates how a variety of pathologies within this system can result in the development of a watery eye. It describes the role of the nurse consultant in the diagnosis and management of patients with watery eye in the lacrimal clinic, and how the training programme for the development of such skills was implemented. Following training, within the realms of an established pilot study, the nurse consultant began to implement her skills in a newly established nurse-led lacrimal clinic. Patients seen in the lacrimal clinic would previously have been assessed and managed by a doctor. To confirm the accuracy of this approach, an audit was undertaken comparing the nurse-led diagnosis and management plans with that of an oculoplastic doctor. In addition, patient waiting times in the clinic and patient satisfaction were assessed, as important indicators of quality of care. To retrospectively evaluate whether oral glucocorticoid (GC) administration can be tapered or discontinued over a 2-year observation period in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) undergoing a stable oral GC treatment, without deterioration in the disease status. Methotrexate (MTX) and prednisolone (PSL) dosages were increased and decreased, respectively, to the maximum extent possible. Concomitant biological or targeted synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (b/tsDMARDs) were used as required. Changes in PSL and MTX use and disease status were evaluated at baseline (BL), year-1, and year-2. Thirty-six patients were enrolled (median age, 65.4 years; disease duration, 7.1 years). The proportion of patients using PSL decreased over 2 years (100-13.9%, <‚Äâ.0001). While no change was observed in the proportion of patients using MTX, the average administered dose increased at year-1 ( =‚Äâ.06). Moreover, b/tsDMARDs were administered in nine patients (two in year-1, seven in year-2). Hippo inhibitor The Clinical Disease Activity Index remission rate increased from 25.0% to 38.9%. Serious adverse events were identified in two patients. Oral GC administration was discontinued without deterioration in the rheumatoid arthritis disease control. Oral GC administration was discontinued without deterioration in the rheumatoid arthritis disease control.Mechanosensation such as touch, hearing and proprioception, is functionally regulated by mechano-gated ion channels through the process of transduction. Mechano-gated channels are a subtype of gated ion channels engaged in converting mechanical stimuli to chemical or electrical signals thereby modulating sensation. To date, a few families of mechano-gated channels (DEG/ENaC, TRPN, K2P, TMC and Piezo) have been identified in eukaryotes. Using a tractable genetic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans, the molecular mechanism of mechanosensation have been the focus of much research to comprehend the process of mechanotransduction. Comprising of almost all metazoans classes of ion channels, transporters and receptors, C. elegans is a powerful genetic model to explore mechanosensitive behaviors such as touch sensation and proprioception. The nematode relies primarily on its sensory abilities to survive in its natural environment. Genetic screening, calcium imaging and electrophysiological analysis have established that ENaC proteins and TRPN channel (TRP-4 protein) can characterize mechano-gated channels in C. elegans. A recent study reported that TMCs are likely the pore-forming subunit of a mechano-gated channel in C. elegans. Nevertheless, it still remains unclear whether Piezo as well as other candidate proteins can form mechano-gated channels in C. elegans. Although renal cell carcinoma remains one of the most malignant cancers, our understanding of progression and recurrence of this disease is limited. The present study explored the precise role of miR-155-5p in renal cancer metastasis. The expression of miR-155-5p in renal carcinoma clinical tissues and cells was determined using quantitative real time-polymerase chain reaction. The role of miR-155-5p on tumor cell growth were examined using CCK-8 and colony formation assays. Transwell assay was utilized to identify the role of miR-155-5p on the invasion and migration of renal cancer cells. Markers of epithelial-mesenchymal transition were determined using western blot. The in vivo effects of miR-155-5p on renal cancer cell growth, apoptosis, and metastasis were explored using xenograft mice. Luciferase reporter assay was performed to identify the potential target of miR-155-5p. Levels of miR-155-5p were significantly elevated in renal cancer tissues and cell lines. Suppression of miR-155-5p decreased the growth, colony formation, migration, and invasiveness of renal cancer cells."

Technology, AI, and hybrid care models are now driving a new era of accessible and equitable healthcare, especially for underserved populations. In this landscape, Bhubaneswar-based CureBay, founded in 2021, is making a significant impact. Led by Founder & CEO Priyadarshi Mohapatra and co-founders Shobhan Mahapatra and Sanjay Swain, CureBay is bridging the rural healthcare gap with a hybrid model that combines tech-driven efficiency with on-ground care. With over 150 eClinics in Odisha and Chhattisgarh, and expansion plans across eastern and northern India, CureBay offers 'assisted digital care', staffed clinics powered by real-time diagnostics and teleconsultation. Backed by $21 million in Series B funding, the startup is scaling its tech, teams, and territory. In this interview by MyCityLinks, Priyadarshi shares how CureBay is building trust, not just infrastructure, for Bharat's health future. Here are the excerpts. You've recently raised $21 million in Series B funding. What are the immediate and long-term priorities for deploying this capital? The $21 million raised in our Series B round is a mandate to scale CureBay's mission in delivering equitable, dignified healthcare to rural India through a tech-powered, community-anchored model. In the immediate term, capital will go toward three areas. They are as follows. ‚óèTechnology: We are deepening investments in our proprietary tech stack, built fully in-house to integrate AI/ML, IoT diagnostics, and generative AI tools into rural care delivery. This includes building predictive care models, platform upgrades, and rural-first automation tools. ‚óèTalent: We're expanding our leadership and frontline teams across healthcare delivery, engineering, and operations. Solving for Bharat (India) requires not just skills, but alignment with the purpose and this funding helps us build a team that shares that commitment. ‚óèTerritory: We'll expand our eClinic network beyond Odisha and Chhattisgarh into Jharkhand, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Our circle model, a cluster of 50 clinics, enables cost-efficient, quality-controlled expansion into underserved geographies. Long-term, this capital strengthens CureBay's role as a public health infrastructure partner, a model that complements national initiatives like Ayushman Bharat and Viksit Bharat with real-world last-mile execution. How do you ensure the quality of care in remote eClinics, especially with video consultations replacing in-person visits? We don't offer generic teleconsultations, we offer ‚Äúassisted digital care.‚Äù Every eClinic is staffed by trained and certified healthcare workers (nurses, pharmacists), who assist the doctor during the consultation by conducting real-time diagnostics and patient assessments. All clinics follow strict SOPs for clinical care, hygiene, sample collection, and consultation workflows. The caregiver captures vitals (BP, sugar, ECG), conducts point-of-care tests, and enters clinical notes, all of which are visible to the doctor in real time. Every eClinic is equipped with digital tools and medical-grade devices that ensure the quality of diagnosis and prescription doesn't vary by geography. This hybrid setup, where technology, clinical rigour, and human empathy converge, delivers continuity and quality that rivals urban clinics, adapted for rural realities. CureBay's mission revolves around access and not just affordability. Can you elaborate on what that distinction means to you personally and professionally? Affordability is often assumed to be the primary barrier in rural healthcare. But in our experience, access is the bigger gap like physical, informational, and systemic. Professionally, this insight came during our earliest field visits. Families were spending significant amounts, sometimes more than urban households but were paying for incomplete or unsafe care. What they lacked wasn't the willingness to pay, but a dependable, nearby, and dignified health ecosystem. Personally, this belief was crystallized during the pandemic. Despite working at Google and living in Gurgaon, I found it hard to get timely medical care. That moment was humbling and led to the question, if this is my struggle, what must it be like for Bharat (India)? Today, CureBay is solving that question. We don't just deliver cheaper services, we deliver reliable, high-quality care within the patient's reach, wherever they are. With CureBay now operating over 150 clinics across Odisha and Chhattisgarh, what are some on-ground insights or stories that have reinforced your belief in this hybrid model? Here we get two insights standing out. The first one is, patients in rural India respond quickly to dependable care. In one of our clinics, a woman who had never seen a gynecologist was able to consult a specialist digitally, assisted by a Swasthya Mitra she trusted. That small moment changed her entire perception of what healthcare could be. Second, preventive health is gaining traction in places where it was once thought impossible. Our preventive care program now has over 100,000 active members, with 60%+ renewal. This tells us that when trust is established, rural patients aren't just reacting to illness, they're investing in well-being. We've served over 5.5 lakh unique patients, and each interaction validates that the hybrid model, part digital, part physical, fully human is not only viable, but deeply needed...."

Positive opinion is based on results from the pivotal Phase III ARANOTE trial. Pending approval, this broadened indication would give doctors the option to use darolutamide plus ADT, with or without chemotherapy (docetaxel), offering greater flexibility to tailor treatment plans to meet mHSPC patients' needs. Orion's collaboration partner Bayer announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency has recommended darolutamide, an oral androgen receptor inhibitor (ARi), plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (mHSPC). The CHMP recommendation is based on positive results from the pivotal Phase III ARANOTE trial which showed that darolutamide plus ADT significantly reduced the risk of radiological progression or death by 46% compared to placebo plus ADT (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.41‚Äì0.71; P<0.0001) in patients with mHSPC. A final decision on marketing authorisation from the European Commission is anticipated in the coming months. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved darolutamide in combination with ADT for mHSPC in June 2025, making it the first and only in the US and FDA-approved ARi for the treatment of patients with mHSPC, in combination with ADT, with or without chemotherapy. Darolutamide, under the brand name Nubeqa¬Æ, is approved in over 85 countries for use with ADT and docetaxel in mHSPC, and with ADT alone in non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (nmCRPC) in patients who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease. Darolutamide is developed jointly by Orion and Bayer. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer and the fifth most common cause of cancer death in men worldwide. In 2022, an estimated 1.5 million men were diagnosed with prostate cancer, and about 397,000 died from the disease worldwide.1 In Europe, there were almost 474,000 estimated new cases of prostate cancer in 2022 with approximately 115,000 deaths. 2 Prostate cancer diagnoses are projected to increase to 2.9 million by 2040.3 About the ARANOTE trial The ARANOTE trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III study designed to assess the efficacy and safety of darolutamide plus ADT in patients with mHSPC. 669 patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 600mg of darolutamide twice daily or matching placebo in addition to ADT. The primary endpoint of this study is rPFS, measured as time from randomization to date of first documented radiological progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. Secondary endpoints include overall survival (time to death from any cause), time to first castration resistant event, time to initiation of subsequent anti-cancer therapy, time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression, PSA undetectable rates, time to pain progression, and safety assessments. Results from the Phase III ARANOTE trial presented at ESMO 2024 and published in The Journal of Clinical Oncology showed that darolutamide plus ADT significantly reduced the risk of radiological progression or death by 46% compared to placebo plus ADT (HR 0.54; 95% CI 0.41‚Äì0.71; P<0.0001), in patients with mHSPC. Consistent benefits in radiological progression-free survival (rPFS) were observed across prespecified subgroups, including patients with high-volume (HR 0.60, 95% CI: 0.44-0.80) and low-volume (HR 0.30, 95% CI: 0.15-0.60) mHSPC. The incidence of adverse events in the treatment group with darolutamide plus ADT in the ARANOTE study was comparable to placebo plus ADT. Darolutamide plus ADT was generally well tolerated and showed lower discontinuation rates due to adverse events compared to placebo plus ADT. About darolutamide Darolutamide is an oral ARi with a unique chemical structure that binds with high affinity to the androgen receptor and exhibits a strong antagonistic effect against the androgen receptor inhibiting the receptor function and the growth of prostate cancer cells. Additionally, preclinical models and neuroimaging data in healthy humans, support darolutamide's low potential for blood-brain barrier penetration. Darolutamide (plus ADT or plus ADT and docetaxel) demonstrated a side effect profile, in both mHSPC registrational studies where the incidences of adverse events were roughly similar to the respective comparator arm. Darolutamide is a treatment option for doctors and patients, considering its tolerability and low risk of drug interaction. A robust clinical development program is underway investigating darolutamide across various stages of prostate cancer. The program includes the Phase III ARASTEP trial evaluating darolutamide plus ADT compared to ADT alone in hormone-sensitive high-risk biochemical recurrence (BCR) prostate cancer, who have no evidence of metastatic disease by conventional imaging and a positive PSMA PET/CT at baseline. Furthermore, darolutamide is also being investigated by Bayer in the collaborative Phase III DASL-HiCaP (ANZUP1801) trial led by the Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group (ANZUP). The study evaluates darolutamide as a treatment for localized prostate cancer in combination with radiotherapy. About metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer At the time of diagnosis, most men have localized prostate cancer, meaning their cancer is confined to the prostate gland and can be treated with curative surgery or radiotherapy. mHSPC is a stage in the disease where the cancer has spread outside of the prostate to other parts of the body. Up to 10% of men will present with mHSPC when first diagnosed.4,5,6 For patients with mHSPC, ADT is the cornerstone of treatment, in combination with chemotherapy docetaxel and/or an androgen receptor inhibitor (ARi). Despite treatment, most men with mHSPC will eventually progress to castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), a condition with limited survival. References Bray F et al.

Results from the SUNMO study will be submitted to global health authorities, including the US Food and Drug Administration. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network¬Æ (NCCN¬Æ) has recently added Lunsumio and Polivy to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines¬Æ) as a category 2A recommendation for the treatment of people with second-line (2L) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) who are not intended to proceed to transplant. ‚Ä†2 ‚ÄúLunsumio and Polivy represent the first combination of a bispecific antibody and antibody-drug conjugate, which could avoid chemotherapy and potentially provide an alternative option for some patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL,‚Äù said Levi Garraway, MD, PhD, Roche's Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. ‚ÄúWe are also encouraged by the favourable safety profile and potential for outpatient use of this regimen, which may suit diverse patient and healthcare system needs.‚Äù At a median follow-up of 23.2 months, the Lunsumio and Polivy combination demonstrated a 59% reduction in risk of disease progression or death compared to R-GemOx (hazard ratio [HR] 0.41, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.28‚Äì0.61; p<0.0001).1 Median PFS was three times longer with Lunsumio and Polivy at 11.5 months (95% CI: 5.6-17.6), compared to 3.8 months for R-GemOx (95% CI: 2.9-4.1) and 12-month PFS was more than doubled at 48.5% (95% CI: 39.6-57.4) vs.17.8% (95% CI: 5.4-30.3), respectively. This PFS benefit was consistent across subgroups, including in high-risk patients with primary refractory disease (HR 0.46, 95% CI: 0.29‚Äì0.72).1 At the interim analysis, overall survival (OS) data were not yet mature. OS numerically favoured the Lunsumio and Polivy combination with a median of 18.7 months (95% CI: 14.1‚Äìnot evaluable [NE]) compared to 13.6 months for R-GemOx (95% CI: 9.9‚ÄìNE; HR 0.80; 95% CI: 0.54 - 1.20).1 ‚ÄúThere remains a clear need for effective and well-tolerated treatments for people with this difficult-to-treat disease,‚Äù said Jason Westin, Professor of Lymphoma and Director of Lymphoma Clinical Research, The University of Texas, MD Anderson Cancer Center. ‚ÄúIf approved, this off-the-shelf treatment combination of mosunetuzumab and polatuzumab vedotin could be administered over a fixed period of time, without mandatory hospitalisation or traditional chemotherapy, which could provide a meaningful option for patients with relapsed or refractory LBCL.‚Äù In the Lunsumio and Polivy arm, 30% more patients achieved an objective response (70.3%, 95% CI: 61.9-77.8) compared to R-GemOx (40.0%; 95% CI: 28.5-52.4), and the complete response rate was doubled at 51.4% (95% CI: 42.8-60.0) vs. 24.3% (95% CI: 14.8-36.0).1 Nearly 75% of patients with a complete response were still in remission after one year (72.6%; 95% CI: 61.4-83.8) compared to 44.1% for R-GemOx (95% CI: 13.2-74.9).1 The safety profile of the Lunsumio and Polivy combination was consistent with the known profiles of the individual study medicines, potentially allowing use across outpatient and community settings.1 The incidence of cytokine release syndrome events (CRS) in the Lunsumio plus Polivy arm was low, occurring in one in four patients, with less than 5% of patients experiencing Grade (Gr) 2 or 3 CRS events.1 No immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome events were reported. Rates of Gr3‚Äì4 (58.5% vs. 57.8%) and Gr5 (5.2% vs. 6.3%) adverse events (AEs) were similar between the combination and R-GemOx, with fewer AEs leading to treatment discontinuation in the Lunsumio and Polivy arm (2.2% vs. 4.7%).1 High-dose chemotherapy followed by stem-cell transplant has traditionally been the standard 2L treatment for people with R/R LBCL.3 While 2L therapies have advanced, DLBCL can progress rapidly and many people are not candidates for, cannot tolerate, or do not have access to latest therapies.2,4 There is an urgent need for treatments that are rapidly available upon a diagnosis of relapse, that can manage the disease and improve long-term outcomes. Roche's lymphoma portfolio is one of the broadest in the industry, providing a unique and much-needed opportunity to combine regimens with different and complementary mechanisms of action. We are exploring our CD20xCD3 bispecifics, Lunsumio and Columvi¬Æ (glofitamab), alongside Polivy to move one step closer towards our goal of improving the lives of as many patients with lymphomas as possible. This includes the phase III STARGLO study [NCT04408638] evaluating the efficacy and safety of Columvi in combination with GemOx versus R-GemOx alone in patients with R/R DLBCL who have received at least one prior line of therapy and who are not candidates for autologous stem cell transplant, or who have received two or more prior lines of therapy. Lunsumio is already approved for people with R/R follicular lymphoma after two or more lines of therapy in more than 60 countries worldwide. Polivy in combination with MabThera/Rituxan, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is approved for people with previously untreated DLBCL in more than 100 countries worldwide and in combination with bendamustine and MabThera/Rituxan for R/R DLBCL in more than 90 countries worldwide. About the SUNMO study The SUNMO [NCT05171647] study is an international, multi-centre, randomised phase III trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of subcutaneously administered Lunsmio¬Æ (mosunetuzumab) in combination with intravenous Polivy¬Æ (polatuzumab vedotin) compared to MabThera¬Æ/Rituxan¬Æ (rituximab), gemcitabine and oxaliplatin (R-GemOx), in people with relapsed or refractory (R/R) large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant. Outcome measures include progression-free survival and objective response rate (dual primary endpoints), overall survival, duration of objective response, complete response rate, duration of complete response, safety and tolerability, and patient-reported outcomes. About Lunsumio¬Æ (mosunetuzumab) Lunsumio is a first-in-class CD20xCD3 T-cell-engaging bispecific antibody designed to target CD3 on the surface of T cells and CD20 on the surface of B cells. This dual-targeting activates and redirects a patient's existing T cells to engage and eliminate target B cells by releasing cytotoxic proteins into the B cells.

We evaluated 36 patients and at the time of colposcopy, the images were recorded and analysed for lesion area measurement. A ROC curve was used to obtain the area under the curve and to determine the best cut-off values between area lesion (pixels2) and biopsy result. Fisher's exact test was performed (p‚Äâ less then ‚Äâ.05). Half of the sample had a cervical biopsy showing HPV or LSIL, and 18 (50%)a biopsy showing HSIL or invasive cancer. HSIL and invasive cancer were associated with a lesion area greater than 30,337.03 pixels2 (cut off) with p‚Äâ=‚Äâ.04. Thus the area of the colposcopic lesion is related to the severity of that; so small lesions can be more conservatively followed.IMPACT STATEMENTWhat is already known on this subject? Studies have proposed that the size of lesion in colposcopic imaging can be associated with the grade of CIN, and the size of CIN lesions may be a factor in determining the risk of progression.What do the results of this study add? This is the first study in the literature that uses the measurement of the lesion area in pixels2 in comparison with the severity of the lesion, which provides greater accuracy of the lesion area than the mere measurement of its diameter.What are the implications of these findings for clinical practice and/or further research? The size of the lesion should be considered in the management of cervical intraepithelial lesions. This approach also leads to lower cost and is less invasive. Small lesions will have the best prognosis and would be treated in the way more conservative, bringing to the patients more comfort and less complications with the treatment.Demand for oocyte freezing in absence of a medical indication is growing as women delay childbirth and seek to extend the window of opportunity for parenthood. The optimum age for oocyte freezing is below 35 years, whereas currently the mean age of women undergoing oocyte freezing in the UK is 38 years. Nearly half of women undergoing oocyte freezing are not in a relationship. The treatment is not publicly funded and the average price for a complete oocyte freezing and thawing cycle, including annual storage fees, could reach over ¬£7000. The live birth rate per oocyte thaw cycle is 18% and is influenced by age at the time of oocyte freezing. Women considering social oocyte freezing should be thoroughly counselled about the efficacy, limitations, cost implications and alternatives to oocyte freezing and provided with the appropriate support to enable a truly informed reproductive choice.The aim of this study was to identify the relationship between musculoskeletal problems and sleep quality and exposure to occupational hazards in working pregnant women. The study included a total of 142 pregnant women working in various industries. The risk of experiencing musculoskeletal system problems was found to increase with impaired sleep quality (OR interval min =1.132 max =1.303). As the amount of work-related physical damage increased, musculoskeletal complaints increased (OR interval min = 1.228 max = 1.527). Environmental hazards and psychosocial hazards seemed to increase the risk of having musculoskeletal problems (OR interval min = 1.209 max = 1.465, and OR interval min = 1.326 max = 1.547, respectively). Physical, psychosocial and workplace environmental hazards seemed to increase the risk of musculoskeletal complaints in pregnancy. It was also seen that as sleep quality decreased, so musculoskeletal complaints increased.Impact StatementWhat is already known about this subject? Occupational hrk-related hazards and protective strategies. It may be possible to provide arrangements related to the workplace by including employers in this training.There is a growing concern about women's safety in India. This study examined a grassroots agency's response to domestic violence in the community by examining their empowerment-focused work with survivors through crisis intervention centers. Multi-informant perspectives examined (a) the organizational process of facilitating or strengthening empowerment of survivors and (b) the mechanisms central to this process. Results highlight various salient mechanisms, namely, the adoption of a survivor-centered approach, collaborative relationships with staff, meeting women where they are, systems advocacy, fostering independence, and building long-term networks with formal and informal supports. Implications for intervention and prevention work are discussed.The current study aimed to explore the frequency and types of stuttering in the oral reading and conversational samples of Arabic adults who stutter (AWS). Twelve Kuwaiti-Arabic AWS (mean age 27.3 years) participated in the study. Each participant's stuttering was analyzed in two speaking contexts -oral reading of a standard Arabic passage and spontaneous conversational speech. The results showed that among a majority of the participants the amount of stuttering in conversation was significantly lower than that of reading. However, no significant differences were found in disfluency types within and between samples. The higher occurrence of stuttering in reading may be related to the diglossic nature of Arabic. The linguistic and rhythmic distinctions between Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and Kuwaiti dialectal Arabic are explored to further explain the findings. The negative effects of single and multiple adverse childhood experiences (ACE) on adult mental health are well-documented. However, little is known about the prevalence of chronic mental health problems (MHPs) and use of mental health services (MHSs) compared to adults without an ACE history. Examine differences in the prevalence of chronic MHP and MHS use between adults without and with a single and multiple ACE history, and MHS use among ACE and no-ACE adults with chronic MHP. A 6-year longitudinal study was conducted based on a random sample of the Dutch adult population ( =‚Äâ2427). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that adults with a single ( =‚Äâ280) and multiple ACE ( =‚Äâ92) history suffered more often from chronic MHP such as chronic depressive and anxiety symptoms. Both ACE subgroups also made greater use of MHS than no-ACE adults ( =‚Äâ2055). Multiple ACE compared to single ACE, increased the risk of MHP. However, among those with chronic MHP respondents with and without an ACE history did not differ in MHS use."

Six patients received antibiotic treatment prior to obtainment of cultures. Of culture-positive cases, MRI findings for OM were definitive or probable in six of nine (67%), suspected in three of nine (33%). Distinction between OM and sickle-related bone infarct or vasoocclusion is difficult based on imaging findings alone. Early attainment of blood and operative cultures increases the likelihood of identifying and adequately treating OM.

Accumulating data have suggested seizures occur frequently in patients with neuronal surface antibody-mediated autoimmune encephalitis. We aimed to evaluate seizure outcomes and potential factors associated with the development of epilepsy in patients with anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), anti-leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 (LGI1), and anti-gamma-aminobutyric-acid B receptor (GABA R) encephalitis. Patients with anti-NMDAR, anti-LGI1, and anti-GABA R encephalitis were prospectively recruited from 2014 to June 2019, with a median follow-up period of 30.5months (range 8-67months). Seizure outcomes were assessed and risk factors of epilepsy were analyzed. A total of 119 patients with anti-NMDAR, anti-LGI1, and anti-GABA R encephalitis were included, and 83 (69.7%) of them developed new-onset seizures. By the end of follow-up, 17 (21.3%) of 80 patients had seizure relapses after intermittent seizure remission or exhibited uncontrolled seizure episodes, contributing to epilepsy. Immunotherapy delay and interictal epileptic discharges (IEDs) were identified to be associated with the development of epilepsy in patients with anti-NMDAR, anti-LGI1, and anti-GABA R encephalitis, particularly anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Furthermore, multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that immunotherapy delay was an independent predictor for epilepsy. Our study suggested that immunotherapy delay and IEDs were associated with the development of epilepsy in patients with anti-NMDAR, anti-LGI1, and anti-GABA R encephalitis. Early diagnosis and treatment were required, and particular consideration should be given to patients with these risk factors.

These facultative intracellular bacteria have been an invaluable tool in immunology research for more than three decades. Intravenous (i.v.) injection is the most commonly used transmission route in mice, but oral models of infection have also been developed in recent years, and these may be more appropriate for many studies. This article includes detailed instructions for use of either foodborne or i.v. inoculation of mice and discusses the rationale for choosing either model. Additionally, a protocol is provided for enrichment of neutrophils and monocytes from the infected liver in a manner that allows for determination of bacterial burden while still providing sufficient cells for use in flow cytometric analysis or in vitro assays. ¬© 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC.

Work engagement is defined as a positive, fulfilling feeling about one's job and is associated with higher productivity and morale. We performed a cross-sectional study to investigate whether work engagement is related to healthier dietary behaviors among Japanese workers. The present study was part of the Japanese Study of Health, Occupation, and Psychosocial Factors Related to Equity. A validated food frequency questionnaire was used to evaluate daily nutritional intake. The following seven nutrients were considered salt intake, dietary fat (saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, and polyunsaturated fatty acids), dietary fiber, folate, and isoflavone. Multivariable linear regression analysis was performed, adjusting for job stress, psychological distress, and other confounders. The baseline survey inquired about work engagement among 2,233 employees of 12 workplaces in Japan, representing a range of industries. The mean age of the sample was 43.4¬±9.7years and 89.7% of the participants were male. The mean score of work engagement was 2.9¬±1.0. Higher work engagement was significantly positively associated with higher salt intake (Œ≤=0.17, SE=0.06, P=.006), monounsaturated fatty acids (Œ≤=0.29, SE=0.13, P=.03), polyunsaturated fatty acids (Œ≤=0.28, SE=0.09, P=.001), dietary fiber (Œ≤=0.23, SE=0.09, P=.012), and folate (Œ≤=10.2, SE=2.9, P=.005) consumption, but not saturated fatty acid (Œ≤=0.16, SE=0.11, P=.13) or isoflavone (Œ≤=0.64, SE=0.36, P=.072). The present study suggested that higher work engagement is associated with a healthier pattern of dietary behaviors among workers. Improving work engagement may be a novel target for workplace health promotion.

C3a interacts with the C3a receptor (C3aR), whereas C5a and its primary degradation product C5a-desArg engage C5aR1 and C5aR2. In the past, analysis of AT expression has been hampered by cross reaction of antibodies designed to recognize the different AT receptors. Furthermore, assessment of effects mediated by cell-specific activation has been difficult. Here, floxed AT receptor reporter mice are described as tools to monitor AT receptor expression in cells and tissues and to study the functions of C3a and C5a by cell-specific deletion of their cognate AT receptors. ¬© 2020 The Authors.

NXT007 is a next-generation investigational bispecific antibody, engineered by Chugai, a member of the Roche Group. Early data from the NXTAGE study suggest that NXT007 may have the potential to provide haemostatic normalisation in people with haemophilia A (without factor VIII inhibitors). NXT007 showed a tolerable safety profile with no thromboembolic events reported so far.1 These results were featured as an oral presentation at the 2025 International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) Congress, 21-25 June, Washington D.C., United States.1 ""These NXT007 data are promising for people with haemophilia A and underscore our ongoing commitment to advancing care and addressing the real-world challenges faced by this community,"" said Levi Garraway, MD, PhD, Roche's Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. ""Hemlibra established a new standard of care, and our focus is to continue to deliver breakthrough innovation that might ultimately help people with haemophilia to live their lives in a manner unaffected by this condition."" NXT007 leverages the Roche Group's expertise in haemophilia A and bispecific antibody development. Our goal is to bring a next generation prophylactic to our portfolio, offering greater therapeutic choice, sustained, elevated bleed protection and reduced treatment burden with factor independence - to allow patients to experience freedom from constant vigilance and have confidence in bleed protection. NXT007 will be further evaluated in a robust clinical development programme, including ongoing phase I/II clinical trials, with additional phase II data expected later this year. There are also three phase III studies currently planned for 2026, including a phase III head-to-head study with Roche's Hemlibra, the first available prophylactic treatment that can be administered subcutaneously and with flexible dosing options (every week, two weeks or four weeks).4,5 Part B of the phase I/II NXTAGE study, conducted by Chugai, in Japan, Taiwan and South Korea, is evaluating the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and efficacy of prophylaxis with NXT007 in people with haemophilia A without factor VIII inhibitors who had not been previously treated with Hemlibra¬Æ (emicizumab).1 Thirty participants (from 12 to 65 years of age) were enrolled in four cohorts (B-1 to B-4) to receive ascending doses of subcutaneous NXT007 every two-to-four weeks during the maintenance period (following four-to-six weeks of loading doses). In presented data from the primary analysis, no treated bleeds were observed with NXT007 in the highest dose cohorts (B-3 and B-4). NXT007 was well tolerated, with no thromboembolic events observed so far.1 About NXT007 NXT007 is a next-generation investigational bispecific antibody, being investigated as a prophylactic (preventive) treatment option for people with haemophilia A.1,2,3 NXT007 was engineered by Chugai - a member of the Roche Group - built on Hemlibra¬Æ (emicizumab)'s framework, with the aim of optimising factor VIII-mimetic activity and half-life, to further enhance potency, efficacy, dosing and administration convenience. NXT007 brings together factor IXa and factor X, proteins required to activate the natural coagulation cascade.1,2,3 NXT007 is being studied in a robust clinical development programme exploring its potential to achieve sustained elevated bleed protection equivalent to people who do not have haemophilia A (sustained haemostatic normalisation), and reduced treatment burden with factor independence, offering people living with haemophilia A greater therapeutic choice.1,2,3 About haemophilia A Haemophilia A is an inherited, serious disorder in which a person's blood does not clot properly, leading to uncontrolled and often spontaneous bleeding. Haemophilia A affects around 900,000 people worldwide.6,7 People with haemophilia A either lack or do not have enough of a clotting protein called factor VIII. In a healthy person, when a bleed occurs, factor VIII brings together the clotting factors IXa- and X, which is a critical step in the formation of a blood clot to help stop bleeding. Depending on the severity of their symptoms, people with haemophilia A can bleed frequently, especially into their joints or muscles.8 These bleeds can present a significant health concern as they often cause pain and can lead to chronic swelling, deformity, reduced mobility and long-term joint damage.9 A serious complication of treatment is the development of inhibitors to factor VIII replacement therapies. Inhibitors are antibodies developed by the body's immune system that bind to and block the efficacy of replacement factor VIII, making it difficult, if not impossible, to obtain a level of factor VIII sufficient to control bleeding.6 About Roche in haematology Roche has been developing medicines for people with malignant and non-malignant blood diseases for more than 25 years; our experience and knowledge in this therapeutic area runs deep. Today, we are investing more than ever in our effort to bring innovative treatment options to patients across a wide range of haematologic diseases.

La Organizaci√≥n Mundial de la Salud (OMS) reconoce formalmente al menos 21 infecciones como enfermedades tropicales desatendidas (ETD), y a√±adi√≥ el envenenamiento por mordedura de serpiente a esta lista en junio de 2017. En Am√©rica Latina, y particularmente en Panam√°, la familia Viperidae es una causa prevalente de estas mordeduras. Las provincias Panam√° Este, Veraguas, Cocl√© y Chiriqu√≠ presentan incidencias superiores a 100 mordeduras de serpientes/100,000 habitantes/a√±o. (Otero-Pati√±o, 2009). Las enfermedades tropicales desatendidas (ETD) son un conjunto de enfermedades infecciosas que afectan principalmente a poblaciones vulnerables, como las que viven en condiciones de pobreza, en zonas de conflicto o con acceso limitado a servicios de salud. Afectan a una de cada seis personas en todo el mundo, y m√°s de la mitad vive en zonas donde podr√≠an infectarse. La Dra. Alexa Prescilla Ledezma, docente e investigadora de la Universidad de Panam√°, se ha dedicado al estudio de la microbiolog√≠a cl√≠nica y parasitolog√≠a molecular (tesis doctoral), aportando importantes resultados de sus investigaciones a la ciencia en Panam√°. La especialista se√±ala que entre los objetivos de sus estudios est√° identificar comunidades bacterianas presentes en la cavidad oral y el veneno de serpientes de la familia Viperidae en Panam√°, con t√©cnicas bioqu√≠micas automatizadas de identificaci√≥n como el VITEK, que permite identificar g√©neros bacterianos importantes que producen infecciones complejas en el accidente of√≠dico, as√≠ como medir y validar susceptibilidad a antibi√≥ticos, junto con t√©cnicas moleculares como la secuenciaci√≥n de nueva generaci√≥n (NGS). ¬øQui√©n es Alexa Prescilla Ledezma? AP: Soy tecn√≥loga m√©dica egresada de la Facultad de Medicina de la Universidad de Panam√°, actualmente profesora titular del Departamento de Microbiolog√≠a Humana de la Facultad de Medicina, tecn√≥loga m√©dica en el Laboratorio Cl√≠nico del Hospital Pedi√°trico de Alta Complejidad de la Ciudad de la Salus (CSS) y miembro del Sistema Nacional de Investigaci√≥n (SIN). Enfoque y metodolog√≠as en sus investigaciones    AP: Los enfoques de las investigaciones est√°n orientados principalmente a enfermedades desatendidas, como lo son los accidentes of√≠dicos por serpientes venenosas de la familia Viperidae y la enfermedad de Chagas. Para tales fines se ha utilizado m√©todos como: Cultivos microbiol√≥gicos tradicionales; identificaci√≥n y sensibilidad bacteriana; pruebas moleculares: secuenciaci√≥n de nueva generaci√≥n (NGS), pruebas serol√≥gicas, t√©cnicas microsc√≥picas, experimentaci√≥n animal, citometr√≠a de flujo, en colaboraci√≥n con investigadores de otros centros de investigaciones nacionales como el Centro de Investigaci√≥n e Informaci√≥n de Medicamentos y T√≥xicos (CIIMET), Instituto Conmemorativo Gorgas de Estudios de la Salud (ICGES), Indicasat AIP, e internacionales como el Instituto de Biotecnolog√≠a de la Universidad de Granada y el Centro de Instrumentaci√≥n Cient√≠fica de la Universidad de Granada. Publicaciones Alexa Prescilla Ledezma    AP: Hasta el momento cuento con 7 publicacionesen revistas indexadas, las cuales he realizado en colaboraci√≥n con el grupo de investigaci√≥n donde realic√© mis estudios doctorales y con investigadores nacionales de Indicasat. Entre ellas, la que puedo mencionar como m√°s relevante, por las consultas y citaciones, es la publicada en el 2021 titulada Biophysical and Biochemical Comparison of Extracellular Vesicles Produced by Infective and Non-Infective Stages of Trypanosoma cruzi. International Journal of Molecular Sciences. 2025       Whole genome sequence data of Mycolicibacterium para fortuitum Panama NTM 1 from a dairy farm in Panama, Data in Brief, Volume 59,    2024    Circulating extracellular vesicles in sera of chronic patients as a method for determining active parasitism in Chagas disease. PLoS Negl Trop Dis. 2022     ‚ÄúMolecular Recognition of Surface Trans-Sialidases in Extracellular Vesicles of the Parasite Trypanosoma cruzi Using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM).‚Äù International journal of molecular sciences. Financiamientos obtenidos    AP: Los proyectos realizados se han financiado mediante la Secretar√≠a Nacional de Ciencias y Tecnolog√≠a (Senacyt) y por parte de la Universidad de Panam√° mediante l Convocatoria Universitaria de Fondos de Investigaci√≥n (CUFI), Tambi√©n gracias a El Centro de Investigaci√≥n e Informaci√≥n de Medicamentos y T√≥xicos (CIIMET). Proyectos de investigaci√≥n en desarrollo    AP: Actualmente trabajamos en la tesis de una estudiante de Tecnolog√≠a M√©dica: Incidencia de infecciones virales respiratorias causadas por los virus de la influenza A y B, VSR y SARS-CoV-2 en poblaci√≥n universitaria en la Facultad de Medicina 2025. Otro proyecto es La caracterizaci√≥n de la infecci√≥n T. cruzi en ratones Swiss y pruebas in vivo del posible anti-chag√°sico BZ-97. Proyecto en desarrollo con investigadores de Indicasat-AIP. Adem√°s estamos trabajando con colegas de la CSS en un caso cl√≠nico de histoplasmosis y adicionalmente se colabora en otros proyectos de escorpionismo con investigadores de la Facultad de Ciencias de la Universidad de Panam√°. Aportes como investigador en la UP    AP: Publicar en revistas indexadas que contribuyan a el crecimiento sostenido de la producci√≥n cient√≠fica de la Universidad de Panam√°  yformar estudiantes con valores, principios y sobre todo pasi√≥n por la  investigaci√≥n. Investigaci√≥n que desear√≠a desarrollar    AP: Me gustar√≠a seguir trabajando con la poblaci√≥n chag√°sica paname√±a y monitorear la¬†evoluci√≥n de la cronicidad de la enfermedad en √°reas end√©micas. Tambi√©n continuar con los estudios de ofidismo y establecer comparaciones de comunidades bacterianas en diversos tipos de serpientes venenosas con t√©cnicas¬†NGS. Consejo para los estudiantes universitarios:    Motivarlos a adquirir una buena formaci√≥n profesional, ya que en la actualidad y el devenir de la IA esto parece perder importancia. Enfocarse por una rama espec√≠fica de formaci√≥n profesional y especializarse para desarrollar proyectos que repercutan en la sociedad. Hay mucho por hacer desde la Universidad de Panam√°, aprovechando al m√°ximo todo el ingenio y las capacidades de nuestros estudiantes. Sobre Alexa Prescilla Ledezma. La Dra.

There is considerable heterogenicity in clinical outcomes in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). AD-8007 ACSS2 inhibitor The aim of this study was to assess whether dystrophin gene (DMD) pathogenic variant location influences upper or lower extremity motor function outcomes in a large prospective cohort. We used longitudinal timed and quantitative motor function measurements obtained from 154 boys with DMD over a 10-y period by the Cooperative International Neuromuscular Research Group Duchenne Natural History Study (CINRG-DNHS) to understand how the trajectories of motor function differ based on proximal versus distal DMD pathogenic variants. Proximal variants were defined as located proximal to 5' DMD intron 44, and distal variants as those including nucleotides 3' DMD including intron 44. Distal DMD variants are predicted to alter the expression of short dystrophin isoforms (Dp140, Dp116, and Dp71). We compared various upper extremity and lower extremity motor function measures in these two groups, after adjusting for total lifetime corticosteroid use. The time to loss-of-ambulation and timed motor function measurements of both upper and lower limbs over a 10-y period were comparable between boys with proximal (n=53) and distal (n=101) DMD pathogenic variants. Age had a significant effect on several motor function outcomes. Boys younger than 7y of age (n=49) showed gain in function whereas boys 7y and older (n=71) declined, regardless of dystrophin pathogenic variant location.

Diabetic nephropathy is a common complications related to high morbidity and mortality in type 2 diabetes. We investigated the action of the dual modulator, PTUPB, a soluble epoxide hydrolase and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor against diabetic nephropathy. Sixteen-week-old type 2 diabetic and proteinuric obese ZSF1 rats were treated with vehicle, PTUPB or enalapril for 8weeks. Measurements were made of epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, thromboxane B (TBX ) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE ) in the kidney of these and lean ZSF1 rats along with their blood pressure. Obese ZSF1 rats were diabetic with fivefold higher fasting blood glucose levels and markedly higher HbA1c levels compared with lean ZSF1 rats. PTUPB nor enalapril reduced fasting blood glucose or HbA1c but alleviated the development of diabetic nephropathy. In PTUPB-treated obese ZSF1 rats, glomerular nephrin expression was preserved. Enalapril also alleviated diabetic nephropathy. Diabetic renal injury in obese ZSF1 rats was accompanied by renal inflammation with six to sevenfold higher urinary MCP-1 (CCR2) level and renal infiltration of CD-68 positive cells. PTUPB and enalapril significantly reduced urinary MCP-1 levels and renal mRNA expression of cytokines. Both PTUPB and enalapril lowered blood pressure. PTUPB but not enalapril decreased hyperlipidaemia and liver injury in obese ZSF1 rats. Overall, the dual modulator PTUPB does not treat hyperglycaemia but can effectively alleviate hypertension, diabetic nephropathy, hyperlipidaemia and liver injury in type 2 diabetic rats. Our data further demonstrate that the renal actions of PTUPB are comparable with a current standard diabetic nephropathy treatment.

Dentinal hypersensitivity is characterized by short, sharp pain from exposed dentine that occurs in response to external stimuli such as cold, heat, osmotic, tactile or chemicals, and cannot be explained by any other form of dental defect or pathology. Laser therapy has become a commonly used intervention and might be effective for dentinal hypersensitivity. To assess the effects of in-office employed lasers versus placebo laser, placebo agents or no treatment for relieving pain of dentinal hypersensitivity. Cochrane Oral Health's Information Specialist searched the following databases Cochrane Oral Health's Trials Register (to 20 October 2020), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (the Cochrane Library 2020, Issue 9), MEDLINE Ovid (1946 to 20 October 2020), Embase Ovid (1980 to 20 October 2020), CINAHL EBSCO (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature; 1937 to 20 October 2020), and LILACS BIREME Virtual Health Library (Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Iny of life. Limited and uncertain evidence from meta-analyses suggests that the application of laser overall may improve pain intensity when tested through air blast or tactile stimuli at short, medium, or long term when compared to placebo/no treatment. Overall, laser therapy appears to be safe. Future studies including well-designed double-blinded RCTs are necessary to further investigate the clinical efficacy of lasers as well as their cost-effectiveness.

Chromatin is a tightly packaged structure of DNA and protein within the nucleus of a cell. The arrangement of different protein complexes along the DNA modulates and is modulated by gene expression. Measuring the binding locations and occupancy levels of different transcription factors (TFs) and nucleosomes is therefore crucial to understanding gene regulation. Antibody-based methods for assaying chromatin occupancy are capable of identifying the binding sites of specific DNA binding factors, but only one factor at a time. In contrast, epigenomic accessibility data like MNase-seq, DNase-seq, and ATAC-seq provide insight into the chromatin landscape of all factors bound along the genome, but with little insight into the identities of those factors. Here, we present RoboCOP, a multivariate state space model that integrates chromatin accessibility data with nucleotide sequence to jointly compute genome-wide probabilistic scores of nucleosome and TF occupancy, for hundreds of different factors. We apply RoboCOP to MNase-seq and ATAC-seq data to elucidate the protein-binding landscape of nucleosomes and 150 TFs across the yeast genome, and show that our model makes better predictions than existing methods."

Oleanolic acid is a bioactive pentacyclic triterpenoid and is widely found in medicinal herbs around the world. In this study, we explored the effect of oleanolic acid on renal fibrosis and the underlying molecular mechanisms by using a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). Male Sprague-Dawley rats were orally administered with oleanolic acid (6‚Äâmg/kg/d) or vehicle (olive oil) for 21 days after the UUO surgery. TASIN30 Upon termination, urine and blood were collected for renal function analysis, and kidneys were harvested for pathological analysis by using hematoxylin-eosin and Masson trichrome staining. Changes of extracellular matrix mRNA expressions and TGF-Œ≤/Smad signaling in the kidneys were also determined. As a result, oleanolic acid significantly reduced the kidney index, the level of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen, and the urinary level of microalbumin, Œ±1-microglobulin, and N-acetyl-Œ≤-glucosaminidase. Masson trichrome staining showed significantly less collagen deposition in the UUO rats with oleanolic acid treatment. Diminished mRNA expressions of collagen I, collagen III, fibronectin, and Œ±-SMA in the kidney tissues were observed after the treatment. Oleanolic acid led to decreased protein expressions of TGF-Œ≤, TGF-Œ≤ receptor I, and TGF-Œ≤ receptor II, as well as the phosphorylation of Smad2. Our current study suggested that oleanolic acid could be a complementary and alternative therapy for renal fibrosis potentially by targeting the TGF-Œ≤/Smad pathway.

These responses occur because UVB induces a change in expression of aging-related genes through regulation of signal pathways such as that of mitogen-activated protein kinases- (MAPKs-) activator protein 1 (AP-1). Ranunculus bulumei, which is used as an herb in Indonesia, belongs to the Ranunculaceae family, which has been reported to perform various physiological effects including antioxidant and anti-inflammation. However, data on the pharmaceutical and cosmeceutical utility of Ranunculus bulumei have not been reported. Therefore, we evaluated the antiaging efficacy of RB-ME, a methanol extract of Ranunculus bulumei. Rb-ME attenuated MMP9 and COX-2 gene expression but enhanced SIRT1 and type-1 collagen in UVB-irradiated HaCaT cells. Rb-ME regulated these gene expressions through inhibition of p38 phosphorylation and inactivation of AP-1. In addition, mRNA expression of HAS-2 and -3, which are involved in skin hydration, was elevated in Rb-ME-treated HaCaT cells. Rb-ME also inhibited melanogenesis by suppression of tyrosinase, MITF, and TYRP-1 mRNA in B16F10 cells under Œ±-MSH treatment. Taken together, these results indicate that Rb-ME has a protective effect on some UVB-induced skin photoaging events such as inflammation, collagen degradation, cellular senescence, skin drying, and melanin production through inhibition of the p38-AP-1 signal cascade, indicating that Rb-ME can be used as an active ingredient for antiaging cosmetics.

Nevertheless, there are no studies evaluating the potential developmental toxicity of germinated grains despite the availability of numerous research studies demonstrating the teratogenicity effect of unsprouted seeds. Therefore, this research work was conducted to assess the impact of fenugreek sprouts on maternal and neurobehavioral developmental toxicities on mice. The lyophilized aqueous extract of germinated seeds was administered via oral gavage on a daily basis to five groups of mated female mice throughout pregnancy at doses of 200, 500, 800, and 1000‚Äâmg/kg/day and the control group was administered distilled water. Maternal reproductive toxicity was evaluated, and the surviving pups were assessed for their physical development, malformation, and neurobehavioral toxicity by using a battery of tests from birth to the 25th postnatal day. Additionally, the aqueous extract of germinated and ungerminated seeds was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) for a comparison of their major compounds. For pregnant treated female mice, no death and no intoxication symptoms have been registered during the test. However, the sprouts' extract has provoked a significant decrease in fertility, spontaneous abortion, pup's mortality, and neurobehavioral disorder in offspring. HPLC analysis reveals an increase in total phenolic compound concentration by the process of sprouting.

Therefore, the search for new therapies to counteract this disease is very active. Grias neuberthii is an endemic plant located in the Ecuadorian Amazon region, which has been used in traditional medicine for its pharmacological properties, including its ability to inhibit tumor cell growth, although scientific studies are limited. We have analyzed the effect of this plant on two colon carcinoma cell lines, that is, RKO (normal p53) and SW613-B3 (mutated p53) cells. Among several extracts obtained from various parts of G. neuberthii plant, we identified the extract with the greatest cytotoxic potential, derived from the stem bark. The cytotoxic effect was similar on both cell lines, thus indicating that it is independent of the status of p53. However, significant differences were observed after the analysis of colony formation, with RKO cells being more sensitive than SW613-B3."

""We are proud of the research presented at the ADA conference, which demonstrates that alpha cells in animal models of T1D have undergone transdifferentiation to beta-like cells after being transduced with GPX-002. In addition, the beta-like cells were still providing improved control of glucose levels after three months,"" said Ryan Confer, President and Chief Executive Officer at Genprex. ""We are very excited to continue evaluating GPX-002 as we further optimize how to control anti-viral immunity and move toward human clinical trials."" The oral presentation details for the Genprex-supported abstract at the ADA 85th¬†Scientific Sessions: Title:¬†Recombinant AAV-mediated Gene Therapy For The Treatment Of Streptozotocin-Induced Diabetes in Non-Human Primates Type: Oral Presentation Track: Immunology/Beta-Cell Replacement Category: Exploring Alternative Strategies to Stem Cell-Derived Beta Cells and Insights from Autologous Islet Transplantation Presentation Date: Monday, June 23, 2025 Presentation Time: 1:30 p.m. CT Presenter: Hannah Rinehardt, MD, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center The oral presentation discussed GPX-002, the diabetes gene therapy, which uses infusion of recombinant adeno-associated virus (rAAV) retrograde into the pancreatic duct to deliver the Pdx1 and MafA genes. The gene therapy converts alpha cells into beta-like cells that secrete insulin physiologically, reversing diabetes in mouse models, where immunosuppression was not necessary. Researchers evaluated the immune response to direct infusion of rAAV into the pancreatic duct of non-human primates (NHPs) with streptozotocin-induced diabetes and evaluated how to best manage immune responses against the virus capsid proteins. Diabetes was induced with streptozotocin (STZ) in cynomolgus macaques, a type of NHP. NHPs received retrograde intraductal infusion of rAAV via laparotomy for precise delivery to the pancreas. rAAV capsids were chosen based on tropism for endocrine cells, and pre-existing neutralizing antibody titers (NAbs) were negative. Expression of viral proteins occurs for a limited period of time after rAAV infection, since the infection doesn't produce new AAV virus. One-month post-infusion, NHPs showed improved glucose tolerance and reduced insulin requirements. In the following months, using steroid-sparing regimens, increases in pancreatic B and T lymphocyte populations were noted on single cell RNA sequencing. Temporary immunosuppression (IS), using a combination of rituximab, rapamycin, and steroids for a 3-month course is largely effective at preventing anti-viral immunity. However, discontinuation of IS at 3 months post-infusion led to an immune response afterwards, indicating that IS in NHPs may need to be continued longer, and six months of IS in NHPs is now being evaluated. When colocalization of insulin and glucagon is quantified, there was significantly elevated colocalization in treated islets compared to untreated diabetic and non-diabetic controls. This suggests that GPX-002 can lead to transdifferentiation of alpha cells into a new population of beta-like cells that make insulin but still retain the capacity to produce glucagon. In conclusion, the novel rAAV gene therapy research demonstrated that infusion of rAAV directly into the pancreatic duct of NHPs leads to transdifferentiation of alpha cells to beta-like cells with restoration of glucose homeostasis. IS, including steroids, is necessary for a number of months to prevent anti-viral immunity in NHPs. Researchers are continuing preclinical studies of GPX-002 therapy in NHP models of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes to generate additional data, and current studies are evaluating viral efficacy after six months of IS. About GPX-002 GPX-002, which has been exclusively licensed from the University of Pittsburgh, is currently being developed using the same construct for the treatment of both Type 1 diabetes (T1D) and Type 2 diabetes (T2D). The same general novel approach is used in each of T1D and T2D whereby an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector containing the Pdx1 and MafA genes is administered directly into the pancreatic duct. In humans, this can be done with a routine endoscopy procedure. In T1D, GPX-002 is designed to work by transforming alpha cells in the pancreas into functional beta-like cells, which can produce insulin but may be distinct enough from beta cells to evade the body's immune system. In vivo, preclinical studies show that GPX-002 restored normal blood glucose levels for an extended period of time in T1D mouse models. In T2D, where autoimmunity is not at play, GPX-002 is believed to rejuvenate and replenish exhausted beta cells. About Genprex, Inc. Genprex, Inc. is a clinical-stage gene therapy company focused on developing life-changing therapies for patients with cancer and diabetes. Genprex's technologies are designed to administer disease-fighting genes to provide new therapies for large patient populations with cancer and diabetes who currently have limited treatment options. Genprex works with world-class institutions and collaborators to develop drug candidates to further its pipeline of gene therapies in order to provide novel treatment approaches. Genprex's oncology program utilizes its systemic, non-viral Oncoprex¬Æ Delivery System which encapsulates the gene-expressing plasmids using lipid-based nanoparticles in a lipoplex form. The resultant product is administered intravenously, where it is taken up by tumor cells that then express tumor suppressor proteins that were deficient in the tumor. The Company's lead product candidate, Reqorsa¬Æ Gene Therapy (quaratusugene ozeplasmid), is being evaluated in two clinical trials as a treatment for NSCLC and SCLC. Each of Genprex's lung cancer clinical programs has received a Fast Track Designation from the FDA for the treatment of that patient population, and Genprex's SCLC program has received an FDA Orphan Drug Designation. Genprex's diabetes gene therapy approach is comprised of a novel infusion process that uses an AAV vector to deliver Pdx1 and MafA genes directly to the pancreas. In models of Type 1 diabetes, GPX-002 transforms alpha cells in the pancreas into functional beta-like cells, which can produce insulin but may be distinct enough from beta cells to evade the body's immune system. In a similar approach for Type 2 diabetes, where autoimmunity is not at play, GPX-002 is believed to rejuvenate and replenish exhausted beta cells.

Effective immediately, NIH will no longer issue awards that include a subaward to a foreign entity until the new structure is implemented. The notice did not limit this new structure for foreign recipients to any particular jurisdiction, potentially impacting a wide range of grants and limiting international collaboration with U.S. researchers through the subaward model. In a statement posted by NIH Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya regarding the new award structure, Dr. Bhattacharya indicated that this new structure effectively amounts to a freeze on foreign subawards going forward. ""As we transition to this new system, NIH will no longer allow new subawards to foreign institutions. As new competing awards are issued or non-competing awards re-issued, NIH will no longer support foreign subawards in them."" Both the updated policy and Dr. Bhattacharya's comments indicate that reasons for this new structure include national security, a lack of transparency around how subaward funds overseas are spent, and the inability to track and receive reports on grants. While not explicitly stated as a reason for the policy change in the announcement, the change comes after the Trump Administration and Congressional committees have scrutinized subawards made to Chinese institutions and institutions in foreign countries of concern. Neither the statement from Dr. Bhattacharya nor the guidance provide specific details why all foreign jurisdictions would give rise to national security concerns.

As technology now largely replaces a company's paper-based records, and has become an integral part of business operations, the powers of office-holders under s236 has also evolved to match the new realities of this digital era. In this alert, we explore how the emergence of online instant messaging platforms, email accounts and data storage has transformed insolvency investigations, necessitating a more sophisticated approach that balances corporate transparency against the benefits of such technological advancements, with the imperative to protect individual rights and data protection.

(TSX:APLI; OTCPink: APLIF) (the ‚ÄúCompany‚Äù or ‚ÄúAppili‚Äù), a biopharmaceutical company focused on drug development for infectious diseases and medical countermeasures, today announced its financial and operational results for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 (‚ÄúFYE 2025‚Äù), and provided an update on fiscal 2026. All figures are stated in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. ‚ÄúThe recent commercial re-launch of LIKMEZ¬Æ (ATI-1501), following new patent coverage through to 2039, marked a major milestone for Appili and our partner, Saptalis Pharmaceuticals, LLC (‚ÄúSaptalis‚Äù). Appili was founded to develop ATI-1501, and it's rewarding to see our lead development program in the market,‚Äù said Don Cilla, Pharm.D., M.B.A., President and CEO of Appili Therapeutics. ‚ÄúAs we look to fiscal 2026, we remain focused on driving continued sales of LIKMEZ, advancing ATI-1701 funded activities, and finalizing development plans for ATI-1801. In addition, Appili has submitted five non-dilutive funding proposals to the U.S. government, totaling up to US$125 million.‚Äù In May 2025, the Company's manufacturing and commercialization partner, Saptalis Pharmaceuticals, LLC (‚ÄúSaptalis‚Äù) re-launched LIKMEZ¬Æ¬†metronidazole oral suspension, (500 mg/5 mL) in the U.S. LIKMEZ is the first and only FDA-approved, ready-to-use liquid oral suspension of metronidazole, developed specifically for patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets or who are sensitive to taste. Metronidazole is widely used as a frontline oral treatment with millions of prescriptions written in the U.S. every year. The current tablet form of metronidazole is the only other approved oral form on the U.S. market, but its bitter taste and lack of appropriate dosage forms for patients with difficulty swallowing often presents treatment compliance challenges. LIKMEZ is designed to fill this significant gap in the treatment paradigm with a taste-masked metronidazole oral suspension. ATI-1701, Appili's live-attenuated vaccine candidate for the prevention of tularemia, continues to progress under a Cooperative Agreement with the U.S. Air Force Academy (‚ÄúUSAFA Cooperative Agreement‚Äù), with total program funding allotted of approximately US$11.6 million. During FYE 2025, Appili presented positive findings at the Military Health System Research Symposium and IDWeek 2024‚Ñ¢ demonstrating that a single dose of ATI-1701 provided full protection against lethal tularemia one year after vaccination. These results, combined with research highlighting the elevated risk of tularemia outbreaks in conflict zones, underscore ATI-1701's potential as a critical tool in protecting military personnel and addressing global biodefense needs. In May 2025, Appili Director of Non-Clinical Research, Dr. Carl Gelhaus, Ph.D., together with researchers from the USAFA, and other U.S. based researchers published the manuscript, ‚ÄúThe review consolidates recent findings on the immune system response to¬†infections and suggests various means by which infections can be controlled. By examining diverse¬†¬†strains and animal models, the authors outline promising pathways for effective tularemia vaccine development. Appili successfully completed a knowledge and technology transfer for the ATI-1701 drug substance manufacturing process to its selected Phase 1 contract manufacturing organization. Engineering batches were successfully produced in 2024 to support future development activities. There is currently no approved vaccine for the prevention of tularemia in the U.S., or other major global markets, strengthening ATI-1701's position as a potentially valuable vaccine urgently needed on the market. The Company continues to engage with U.S. government agencies and other stakeholders to explore non-dilutive funding opportunities for the program. ATI-1801 is a novel topical formulation of paromomycin (15% w/w) under advanced clinical development for the treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis, a disfiguring infection of the skin that affects hundreds of thousands of people around the world annually. In response to Appili's recent Type B meeting request, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (‚ÄúFDA‚Äù) agreed with the Company's proposed strategy to establish a scientific bridge between previous clinical trial material and new drug product batches. The alignment with the FDA, allows completion and submission of an NDA much sooner than if additional clinical data were required. Appili expects to pursue non-dilutive funding and partnership opportunities with NGOs and government agencies which share the Company's focus on tropical diseases to implement the agreed-upon strategy and complete remaining development work. ATI-1801 has received an Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA for the treatment of certain forms of cutaneous leishmaniasis. The Company is actively evaluating the eligibility of ATI-1801 for a priority review voucher (‚ÄúPRV‚Äù) which, if confirmed, would make ATI-1801 the second potentially PRV eligible program at Appili, joining ATI-1701, subject to renewal of certain legislation in the United States. During the past quarter, Appili submitted an additional funding proposal to the U.S. government, bringing the total number of proposals to five, representing a combined potential award value of up to US $125 million. If awarded, these funds would support the advanced development of critical infectious disease products aligned with public health and biodefense priorities. ‚ÄúHaving successfully raised US$34.9 million in prior government funds, Appili has built a strong track record in government contracting, and we are well-positioned to execute on innovative programs aligned with public health agencies,‚Äù said Don Cilla, Pharm.D., M.B.A., President and Chief Executive Officer of Appili. ‚ÄúSecuring additional non-dilutive funding remains key to Appili's strategy, enabling us to advance high-priority infectious disease products while maximizing shareholder value‚Äù Aditxt Arrangement and Loan Extensions Subsequent to FYE 2025, on May 30, 2025, Appili delivered its formal termination notice to Aditxt under the arrangement agreement dated April 1, 2024 (as amended) between, , the Company and Aditxt (the ‚ÄúArrangement Agreement‚Äù). Under the Arrangement Agreement, the Company is entitled to a termination fee (the ‚ÄúTermination Fee‚Äù) in the amount of USD$1.25 million payable by Aditxt upon termination of the Arrangement Agreement in certain circumstances. This Termination Fee is to be reduced by certain amounts previously paid to the Company by Aditxt to extend the outside date under the Arrangement Agreement. As of the date hereof, the amount of US$1 million remains payable to Appili on account of the Termination Fee. In connection with the termination of the Arrangement Agreement, Appili has secured 3-month extensions to the amounts due under each of (1) the amended and restated secured loan agreement with Long Zone Holdings Inc.

82fddf7d0fb0975480c120c854629c75,2025-06-26 07:47:00,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Giant Steps is an eye-opening memoir from Derek Shulman due 7th October from Jawbone. Within the book, Shulman that traces his extraordinary journey through music, from 1960s pop fame with Simon Dupree & The Big Sound to cult status as frontman of progressive rock pioneers Gentle Giant, and later as a record executive who signed and developed global acts like Bon Jovi, Dream Theater, Slipknot, Pantera and Men Without Hats, while also helping to revitalise the careers of AC/DC, Bad Company, and others. In Giant Steps, Shulman chronicles a remarkable life and career surrounded by music and creativity in many forms.It begins with a young Derek confidently telling his schoolteacher he would grow up to become a star, and unfolds into a fast-paced and eye-opening journey through decades of pop culture, creative risk-taking, and personal reinvention. Shulman first found fame as a teenager in the 1960s pop and R 'n B group Simon Dupree & The Big Sound, then pushed rock music to the outer edges in the 1970s as frontman of progressive rock pioneers Gentle Giant. Along the way Gentle Giant would become a defining influence on hip-hop, sampled by many of the genre's leading lights including J. Dilla, De La Soul, Run The Jewels, Travis Scott and dozens more. The band was later championed by Questlove, drummer of The Roots and acclaimed filmmaker, who named them one of his favorite rock acts of all time. In the 1980s, he made a bold pivot into the record business, taking on senior roles at labels like Polygram, ATCO, and Roadrunner Records. There, he signed and developed many artists. Clean-living and focused in an industry often defined by chaos and excess, Shulman offers a rare perspective on the evolution of music and culture from the 1960s to today. Giant Steps is essential reading for fans of prog, rock, hip-hop, and anyone curious about the inner workings of the music industry. 'Derek Shulman was there before there was a there. We grew together as a team. We learned as we lived. He was the one real A&R man that we could count on when we needed him,' Jon Bon Jovi. Giant Steps is written by Derek Shulman with Jon Wiederhorn. It is A 304pp softcover book with 3x8pp plate sections containing rare and previously unseen photographs. It can be ordered here. Jon Wiederhorn is a veteran author and music journalist. He is the co-author of Louder Than Hell: The Definitive Oral History Of Metal, Dreaming Japanese (with Marty Friedman), I'm The Man: The Story Of That Guy From Anthrax (with Scott Ian), Ministry: The Lost Gospels According To Al Jourgensen, and My Riot: Agnostic Front, Grit, Guts & Glory (with Roger Miret), and is the author of Raising Hell: Backstage Tales From The Lives Of Metal Legends. He also has worked on staff at Rolling Stone, MTV, and Guitar Magazine, spearheaded the 12-episode exclusive iHeart Radio podcast Backstaged: The Devil In Metal, and written for LA Times, Classic Rock, Guitar World, TV Guide, SPIN, The Village Voice, and Melody Maker. ‚ÄúDerek Shulman was there before there was a there. We grew together as a team. We learned as we lived. He was the one real A&R man that we could count on when we needed him.‚Äù Jon Bon Jovi. 'Many years ago, I had the privilege of playing with Simon Dupree & The Big Sound on a tour of Scotland. It was a joyous experience. The band were fabulous musicians and great guys and treated me so well.' Elton John. ‚ÄúThe intensity of Gentle Giant's performances sometimes extended from stage to dressing room after their show when a noisy post-mortem might erupt into murderous fraternal screaming matches over a missed semi-quaver or less than perfect vocal harmony. Spirited bunch, the Giants, in full flow. Move over, Cain. Step aside, Abel.‚Äù Ian Anderson, Jethro Tull. ‚ÄúWe were into prog rock hard back then and loved it all. However, Gentle Giant was different. The articulate and musically experimental yet beautiful music that came out of the speakers was captivating.‚Äù Steve Lukather, Toto."

The APC were higher in PIF2 (P¬†less then¬†0.01) from Holland (P¬†less then¬†0.01) in the commercial brand 4 (P¬†less then¬†0.01). The ENT median values in PIF1, PIF2, and PIF3 were 1.8, 1.5, and 1.7 log CFU g-1, respectively. Five strains of C. sakazakii and one strain of Cronobacter malonaticus were identified as having values between 0.023 and 2.3 MPN/g. All strains (100%) harbored the ompA, plasminogen activator (cpa), and hemolysin (hly) virulence genes. To conclude, C. sakazakii was found in four PIF samples from four Chilean products and one from Mexico, which is distributed throughout America. C. sakazakii strains exhibit virulence factors and resistance to ampicillin, thus posing a risk when PIFs are consumed by infants. HIGHLIGHTS Copyright ¬©, International Association for Food Protection.Guidelines currently favor vitamin K antagonists or low-molecular-weight heparins for treatment of noncirrhotic portal vein thrombosis (ncPVT). Use of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) in PVT has been met with concern because of the lack of data. We conducted a retrospective study to investigate the efficacy and safety of DOACs for the treatment of ncPVT, and to compare them with standard therapies 330 patients with ncPVT, followed-up for a mean 41.6 months, received warfarin (n = 108), enoxaparin (n = 70), rivaroxaban (n = 65), apixaban (n = 20), dabigatran (n = 8), fondaparinux (n = 2), or no anticoagulation (n = 57). The primary outcome was complete radiographic resolution (CRR) of PVT. Secondary outcomes included recanalization of occlusive PVT, cavernous transformation of the PV, development of chronic portal hypertensive symptoms (cPHS), and major bleeding. DOACs were associated with the highest CRR rates (dabigatran, 6/8 [75%]; apixaban, 13/20 [65%]; rivaroxaban, 42/65 [65%]). Enoxaparin was associated with a CRR rate similar to that of the DOACs (40/70 = 57%). Warfarin was associated with worse outcomes in this regard (CRR rate, 31% [33/108]; hazard ratio [HR] DOACswarfarin, 2.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.87-4.52; P¬†less then¬†.0001). DOACs were associated with recanalization rates similar to enoxaparin and greater than warfarin (HR DOACswarfarin, 3.45; 95% CI, 1.93-6.18; P¬†less then¬†.0001). DOACs were associated with lower rates of cPHS, although this did not attain significance (DOACs, 8/93 [9%]; enoxaparin, 13/70 [19%]; warfarin, 31/108 [29%]). DOACs were associated with less major bleeding relative to warfarin (HR DOACswarfarin, 0.20; 95% CI, 0.05-0.86; P = .0307). Patients harboring JAK2V617F, those with no evident predisposing factor for PVT, and those with occlusive thrombus demonstrated worse outcomes. DOACs appear effective and safe for the treatment of ncPVT. ¬© 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) comprised a heterogeneous group of diseases. The prognosis of patients varies even in the same risk groups. Searching for novel prognostic markers is warranted. Leukemic stem cells (LSCs) are responsible for chemoresistance and relapse in leukemia. Recently, expressions of 17 genes related to stemness of LSCs were found to be associated with prognosis in acute myeloid leukemia patients. However, the clinical impact of LSC genes expressions in MDS, a disorder arising from hematopoietic stem cells, remains unclear. We analyzed expression profile of the 17 stemness-related genes in primary MDS patients and identified expression of 4 genes (LAPTM4B, NGFRAP1, EMP1, and CPXM1) were significantly correlated with overall survival (OS). We constructed an LSC4 scoring system based on the weighted sums of the expression of 4 genes and explored its clinical implications in MDS patients. Higher LSC4 scores were associated with higher revised International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS-R) scores, complex cytogenetics, and mutations in RUNX1, ASXL1, and TP53. High-score patients had significantly shorter OS and leukemia-free survival (LFS), which was also confirmed in 2 independent validation cohorts. selleck kinase inhibitor Subgroup analysis revealed the prognostic significance of LSC4 scores for OS remained valid across IPSS-R lower- and higher-risk groups. Furthermore, higher LSC4 score was an independent adverse risk factor for OS and LFS in multivariate analysis. In summary, LSC4 score can independently predict prognosis in MDS patients irrespective of IPSS-R risks and may be used to guide the treatment of MDS patients, especially lower-risk group in whom usually only supportive treatment is given. ¬© 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.To diagnose graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) is sometimes difficult. We showed previously that MEK inhibitors selectively suppress murine GVHD while retaining antiviral and antitumor immunity. Here, we asked whether the RAS/MEK/ERK pathway is activated in human allo-HSCT recipients with GVHD, and whether the phosphorylated ERK1/2 can be a biomarker of GVHD. Peripheral blood was sequentially collected from 20 allo-HSCT recipients 1 bone marrow transplant, 7 peripheral blood stem cell transplants (PBSCT), and 12 cord blood transplants. Ten of the 20 allo-HSCT recipients developed GVHD, and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in T and B cells was analyzed by flow cytometry. Occurrence of acute GVHD was associated with phosphorylation of ERK1/2 in CD4+ T cells at day 30 (P¬†less then¬†.001), which was suppressed by ex vivo exposure to a MEK inhibitor trametinib at clinically achievable concentrations. In particular, ERK1/2 was phosphorylated preferentially in naive/central memory CD4+ T cells. Notably, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 fell as GVHD improved. These results suggest that phosphorylation status of ERK1/2 in peripheral blood CD4+ T cells may be a future biomarker for diagnosing human GVHD, and the potential efficacy of MEK inhibitors against human GVHD. ¬© 2020 by The American Society of Hematology.Remyelination requires innate immune system function, but how exactly microglia and macrophages clear myelin debris after injury and tailor a specific regenerative response is unclear. Here, we asked whether pro-inflammatory microglial/macrophage activation is required for this process. We established a novel toxin-based spinal cord model of de- and remyelination in zebrafish and showed that pro-inflammatory NF-Œ∫B-dependent activation in phagocytes occurs rapidly after myelin injury. We found that the pro-inflammatory response depends on myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (MyD88). MyD88-deficient mice and zebrafish were not only impaired in the degradation of myelin debris, but also in initiating the generation of new oligodendrocytes for myelin repair. We identified reduced generation of TNF-Œ± in lesions of MyD88-deficient animals, a pro-inflammatory molecule that was able to induce the generation of new premyelinating oligodendrocytes. Our study shows that pro-inflammatory phagocytic signaling is required for myelin debris degradation, for inflammation resolution, and for initiating the generation of new oligodendrocytes."

Spindly leg syndrome (SLS) is one such disease, where affected individuals with underdeveloped limbs often require euthanization. We experimentally evaluated husbandry-related factors of SLS in a captive population of the critically endangered frog, Andinobates geminisae. SLS has been linked to tadpole nutrition, vitamin B deficiency, water filtration methods, and water quality, but few of these have been experimentally tested. We tested the effects of water filtration method and vitamin supplementation (2017) and the effects of tadpole husbandry protocol intensity (2018) on time to metamorphosis and the occurrence of SLS. We found that vitamin supplementation and reconstituted reverse osmosis filtration of tadpole rearing water significantly reduced SLS prevalence and that reduced tadpole husbandry delayed time to metamorphosis. A fortuitous accident in 2018 resulted in a decrease in the phosphate content of rearing water, which afforded us an additional opportunity to assess the influence of phosphate on calcium sequestration. We found that tadpoles that had more time to sequester calcium for ossification during development had decreased the prevalence of SLS. Taken together, our results suggest that the qualities of the water used to rear tadpoles plays an important role in the development of SLS. buy GBD-9 Specifically, filtration method, vitamin supplementation, and calcium availability of tadpole rearing water may play important roles. Focused experiments are still needed, but our findings provide important information for amphibian captive rearing programs affected by high SLS prevalence.Iatrogenic malnutrition and underfeeding are ubiquitous in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide for prolonged periods after ICU admission. A major driver leading to the lack of emphasis on timely ICU nutrition delivery is lack of objective data to guide nutrition care. If we are to ultimately overcome current fundamental challenges to effective ICU nutrition delivery, we must all adopt routine objective, longitudinal measurement of energy targets via indirect calorimetry (IC). Key evidence supporting the routine use of IC in the ICU includes (1) universal societal ICU nutrition guidelines recommending IC to determine energy requirements; (2) data showing predictive equations or body weight calculations that are consistently inaccurate and correlate poorly with measured energy expenditure, ultimately leading to routine overfeeding and underfeeding, which are both associated with poor ICU outcomes; (3) recent development and worldwide availability of a new validated, accurate, easy-to-use IC device; and (4) recent data in ICU patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) showing progressive hypermetabolism throughout ICU stay, emphasizing the inaccuracy of predictive equations and marked day-to-day variability in nutrition needs. Thus, given the availability of a new validated IC device, these findings emphasize that routine longitudinal IC measures should be considered the new standard of care for ICU and post-ICU nutrition delivery. As we would not deliver vasopressors without accurate blood pressure measurements, the ICU community is only likely to embrace an increased focus on the importance of early nutrition delivery when we can consistently provide objective IC measures to ensure personalized nutrition care delivers the right nutrition dose, in the right patient, at the right time to optimize clinical outcomes.In the midst of a global pandemic, couples are dealing a range of impacts that call for a cohesive unit while the virus frays at the edges of our most important relationships. Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) is an evidence-based approach to working with relationships rooted in attachment theory. As a process-oriented psychotherapy, EFT is an ideal approach to working with relationships during this pandemic helping to solidify an ""in it together"" approach required to survive both as a couple and the pandemic. In this paper, we briefly review the adaptations for moving a couple therapy practice online through an EFT lens, drawing on an EFT macro-intervention called the ""Tango"" as a focus in this process. We conclude the paper with a case example providing the reader with an illustration of the process and ideas for what to pay attention to when working online with a couple from an EFT perspective. Oral health values, the degree to which one places importance on or demonstrates investment in improving or maintaining one's dental status, are believed to vary across individuals. Research on this construct is in its infancy, so a new Oral Health Values Scale (OHVS) was developed and validated. The aim was to create a multidimensional measure of oral health values that could be used in future epidemiological or behavioural investigations involving determinants of dental treatment-seeking behaviour and/or oral health. The OHVS was developed in three cross-sectional phases. A 45-item pool was developed, and 12 expert raters from various oral health professions rated the items for their representativeness and relevance, as well as specificity and clarity. Based on the expert feedback, an initial 30-item scale was subsequently established and administered to a developmental sample (N=306) using Amazon's Mechanical Turk (MTurk). The scale was further refined to be 12 items and its structure was confirmed in a validation sample (N=308), also using MTurk."

Its ability to retain moisture, remain stable under heat, and provide mild sweetness makes it an attractive alternative to traditional sugars, especially in diabetic-friendly goods. As global concerns over obesity and dental health intensify, the demand for reduced-calorie alternatives like sorbitol increases. The non-food sector also sees rising interest, with sorbitol serving as a crucial intermediate in vitamin C production. Regulatory endorsements from bodies such as the FDA and EFSA underscore its acceptance across industries. In 2024, the sorbitol market recorded moderate growth, thanks to changing consumer behaviors, product reformulations, and post-pandemic industrial recovery. Consumers' preference for healthier foods led manufacturers to craft new lines of sugar-free snacks and beverages utilizing sorbitol. The personal care sector invested in sorbitol for skincare and oral products, capitalizing on its moisturizing attributes. Pharmaceutical reliance on sorbitol for treatments like cough syrups and laxatives continues due to its high solubility. Production expansions in China and India have helped balance global supply, stabilizing prices. Innovations like sorbitol blends with other polyols are enhancing sweetness and functional benefits. Environmental sustainability is becoming a core focus, with producers exploring bio-based routes and eco-friendly extraction to align with global ESG priorities. From 2025 onwards, sorbitol market growth is expected across food, pharmaceutical, and personal care industries, with emerging applications in bio-based chemicals and packaging. Regulatory pressure for reduced sugar in foods pushes manufacturers toward sorbitol, balancing sweetness without sugar's metabolic drawbacks. In industry, sorbitol's potential in biodegradable surfactants and bioplastics will align with carbon reduction goals. Meanwhile, personalized nutrition trends will heighten demand for sorbitol in customized dietary products. Expansion into markets in Latin America and Africa will unlock new revenue opportunities as food processing infrastructure evolves. However, challenges such as raw material volatility and environmental impact from corn processing could drive innovation in alternative feedstocks and green production, shaping the market's sustainable growth path. Key Trends in the Sorbitol Market Rising demand for sorbitol in sugar-free and diabetic-friendly foods due to health-conscious consumers. Adoption in cosmetics for its humectant properties, enhancing texture in moisturizing products. Increased use as a precursor in vitamin C production, fueling dietary supplement market growth. Focus on bio-based production to meet ESG and consumer transparency expectations. Emergence of polyol blending for enhanced sweetness in health-focused formulations. Key Drivers of the Sorbitol Market Heightened health awareness and sugar reduction mandates driving low-calorie sweetener demand. Pharmaceutical sector expansion supporting sorbitol use in drug formulations. Personal care industry growth spurring sorbitol adoption in oral and skincare products. Emerging markets' development increasing demand for processed foods and healthcare products. Key Challenge in the Sorbitol Market Fluctuations in raw material prices, especially corn, affecting production costs and pricing strategies.

1lm84si,2025-06-27 23:17:12,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Always had bad teeth even though parents and I tried really hard to have good oral care practices and keep good diet (no soda, almost no desserts max once a month). Had fissure pits growing up, and several fillings in molars. Minor fillings, mostly because I noticed sensitivity and told the dentist. Annual x-rays were not a thing and anesthesia was not a thing for fillings. Nothing too serious, some sensitivity when they did the fillings but otherwise, recovery was fine. Fast forward to now, as a full grown adult, I had avoided going to the dentist because I fear them, also because I'm in a different country and always wanted to wait to go home to visit my home dentist because I trust him and he's nice, gentle and professional. The pandemic also put things on hold more. In the last 10 years, I went to home dentist once in 2015, and then again in 2017, don't remember having too many cavities then maybe 1 or 2 max, also had 3 of my wisdom teeth pulled 2017, one of which was impacted. (one of them was barely growing out and so my mom mostly, thought it good to wait it out.) The teeth pulling for the upper two were fine, since they were really far back and already decaying. The lower impacted one was horrible. I felt the dentist yanking on my tooth as my head came OFF the chair twice, something about the roots being strong, etc. Anyway, that was a traumatic experience. 2019, I did a complimentary initial exam with a dentist here (USA), let's call them Dentist A. They did an exam, and bitewing x-rays. Said my teeth looked fine. I didn't go back again till 2024 partly because pandemic, partly I had a lot on my plate and partly procrastination. They did another exam, took bitewing x-rays this time and told me I had 4 cavities, #2, #14, #15, #18. I thought, 4 cavities after 5 years of not seeing a dentist, not as bad as it could have been. They have in-house insurance, I got it, filled the cavities, also includes 2 dental cleanings and 1 more exam. Great. Also told me I had to get the last wisdom tooth extracted as it was causing problems. They warned me about sensitivity in the cavities and to let them know if it persists beyond a few months. I noticed sensitivity on and off, and so 6 months later when I go in for more dental cleaning, I tell them. They checked, took a panorax X-ray, told me everything looked fine and I'm not a high-risk for cavities, my teeth looked clean, said sometimes sensitivity is normal with deeper fillings and to put some Sensodyne on and sent me home. Fast forward to this month 2025, I called in to say I still had sensitivity, can they please check again. Took bitewing x-rays, told me I have 6 cavities. SIX cavities, and one of them, #31 is serious, likely caused from the impacted wisdom tooth, and now I am high-risk for cavities. Here I am doing the math, I have never had 6 cavities in a year. I also have never gotten cleanings twice in a year or visited the dentist this often. Only ever once a year prior at most. The math wasn't adding up. On the paper they gave me, it lists 7 fillings, not sure why because I only remembered 6, and one of them they listed #19 already has a filling - maybe a refilling?? I went to a different dentist for a second opinion, let's call them Dentist B. This was last week. I did mention that Dentist A said 6 cavities (which in hindsight, I shouldn't have said anything and just let them tell me what needed work). Turns out, Dentist B also told me 6 cavities, and agreeing that the most serious one was the one close to the wisdom tooth. In fact, they told me it could be bad enough that if the filling didn't work I would need a root canal and a crown. They didn't note #19 as a tooth that needed filling, ie. the 7th possible filling. This week, I went in and got 2 of the cavities filled with Dentist B. The serious one, #31 and the one next to it #30. They told me that it was very deep and if it gets worse, the root canal is not even an option, it will have to be extracted. I also noticed the 7th filling from my previous dentist, and asked them to check #19 too. They said no, doesn't really seem like an issue in the x-ray and also in-person, not sure why Dentist A listed that on their quote. Just today, I noticed that one of the cavities listed by my Dentist A was #7ML, but the one by Dentist B was #8 DL. And now I'm flipping out again, not knowing what to do and who to trust. Images in order are: 2024 x-ray of #31, 2024 panorax, 2025 bitewing x-rays. So here's my struggle: 1...."

I supported the Staff Vice President of Human Resources, Karen Galambos. Unfortunately, I was diagnosed with Breast Cancer. FedEx, through Karen Galambos, discriminated against me because of my breast cancer disability and request for accommodation. Now I have been in the judicial system for over six years in a Disability Discrimination - Failure to Accommodate Under the Americans with Disabilities Act. FedEx failed to engage in the mandatory interactive process and denied me reasonable accommodation. FedEx did not comply with its legal obligations under the ADA. Instead, I was illegally terminated and escorted to the parking lot by Security in front of my coworkers - like I was a threat to FrdEx. Mr. Smith was aware of the discrimination because I wrote him a letter. I have never had a write-up or any disciplinaries my entire career. FedEx lawyers have vilified me through the judicial system. Congressman Steve Cohen is aware of the discrimination, as I met with him in the Memphis office. He said that he would get back with me but now ignores me. The beginning of litigation FedEx argued that my breast cancer was ""temporary"" and was not protected under the ADA. After I appealed the case, FedEx's lawyer Babcock admitted liability. "" Now the judges are doing everything to cover the discrimination. Violating my constitutional rights; writing Orders with no court hearings, no jury trial, no judicial analysis, no oral arguments, etc. So, the Order is void because I have never had a hearing, which is a violation of due process. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my job at FedEx until I was discriminated against, filed two internal complaints and no one from FedEx's Legal department investigated it. I feel that Mr. Smith could have done something with those lawyers because I had an unblemished work history. The HR department protected the Vice President of HR; the Legal Department protected FedEx and its brand; and no one protected me from the discrimination. Breast cancer does not discriminate, but FedEx does. This is how my long-term career ended: FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE June 2025 **Cancer Survivor Fights FedEx and Federal Courts After ADA Protections Ignored** **Pro Se Plaintiff Brenda Leavy Calls for Public Attention and Legal Accountability Following Systemic Denial of Disability Rights and Due Process** Nashville, TN ‚Äì Brenda Leavy, a former employee of Federal Express Corporation and a breast cancer survivor, is calling for public and legal accountability after her federal disability discrimination lawsuit was dismissed without trial or hearing. Her case, *Leavy v. FedEx*, now pending in the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals (Case No. 21-5882), raises serious concerns about how pro se litigants and cancer patients are treated by the justice system. Leavy was undergoing radiation treatment in 2018 when she requested an extended leave as a reasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Although her physician provided certification and she was already on intermittent FMLA leave, FedEx denied her request. The company initially claimed that her breast cancer was not protected under the ADA because it was ""temporary."" The district court dismissed the case and labeled it ""frivolous,"" denying Leavy the opportunity to proceed in forma pauperis on appeal. But during the appeal, FedEx reversed its position and formally conceded that Ms. Leavy was in fact disabled under the ADA (Appellant Brief Response, Doc. 17, Page 19). Despite this, the Sixth Circuit refused to assign the appeal to a three-judge panel or allow oral argument. No hearing or trial ever took place, and the case was dismissed with no factual record for review. ‚ÄúI was denied both my ADA rights and my right to due process,‚Äù said Leavy. ‚ÄúThe court called my case frivolous without a hearing, while ignoring the fact that FedEx admitted liability on appeal. If this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone with a disability who doesn't have a lawyer.‚Äù Legal precedent‚Äîincluding *Atkins v. Dolgencorp* and *Barnett v. U.S. Air*‚Äîestablishes that failure to accommodate or engage in the interactive process is direct evidence of discrimination. Yet Leavy's case was shut down without even applying those standards. Leavy has filed multiple motions, including a Motion to Recall the Mandate and a Rule 60(b)(4) motion to void judgment for lack of due process. All have been denied or ignored, and the appellate court has not explained why a case involving a conceded ADA violation was treated as legally meritless. Civil rights and disability advocacy groups are now being contacted to review the case. ‚ÄúThe public needs to know how people with cancer are treated‚Äînot just by their employer, but by the courts that are supposed to protect them,‚Äù Leavy said."

Selleckchem 6-OHDA In this in vitro study, energy and hydroelectrolytic beverages altered the color stability and fluorescence of the studied materials at all timepoints. The potential for future color alterations should be considered before anterior composite resin restorations are placed in patients who consume high quantities of these beverages.The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the 2-body wear resistance of 7 direct composite resin materials (Synergy, Filtek Supreme XTE, GrandioSO, Tetric EvoCeram, G-√¶nial Anterior, Venus Pearl, and Ceram.X Duo) following thermomechanical loading as well as their gloss stability following toothbrushing. For measurement of resistance to wear, 8 specimens of each material were thermomechanically challenged under 200,000 load cycles at a maximum force of 49 N and 500 thermal cycles between 5¬∞C and 50¬∞C simultaneously. Wear was analyzed by measuring the volume and vertical loss of the contact point area using a high-speed 3-dimensional scan. For gloss measurements, 8 additional specimens of each material were evaluated using a glossmeter after being subjected to 15 minutes of brushing with an electric toothbrush at a 200-N application force. Filtek Supreme XTE had the least volumetric wear, while G-√¶nial Anterior and Ceram.X Duo had the greatest. The greatest vertical loss was recorded for G-√¶nial Anterior and Ceram.X Duo. Ceram.X Duo also had the greatest loss of gloss units, together with Venus Pearl. The universal composite Filtek Supreme XTE demonstrated the lowest wear rates and the best gloss retention.This case report describes an intraosseous neurilemoma, observed radiographically as a multilocular lesion, in a 12-year-old patient. Physical examination revealed facial asymmetry, swelling on the right side of the mandibular body, and bone expansion in the region of the base of the buccal sulcus. Panoramic radiography revealed a multilocular radiolucency on the right side of the mandibular body in the periapical region extending from the distal region of the first premolar root to the second molar and adjacent to the third molar. Evaluation of a radiograph obtained 3 years earlier for an orthodontic assessment revealed that the lesion was present, appearing as a unilocular radiolucency near the root of the mandibular right first molar. An incisional biopsy of the multilocular lesion was performed, and Antoni A and Antoni B histologic patterns were identified by microscopic analysis. Immunohistochemical analysis was conducted, and neoplastic cells stained positive for the S-100 protein. The patient underwent conservative surgical excision of the lesion, and no recurrence was observed during 7 years of clinical follow-up. Based on analysis of the present case and previous cases reported in the literature, intraosseous neurilemoma, especially its multilocular variant, is an uncommon neoplasm. In the present case, evaluation of the lesion when it was first radiographically detectable, prior to orthodontic treatment, would have permitted a more limited surgical approach for the excision of a small intraosseous lesion.Human papillomavirus (HPV) has a nearly ubiquitous prevalence within the adolescent and adult populations worldwide. The virus has been implicated for decades in cervical and uterine cancers, but recent data have shown an increase in cases of virally related oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma in both male and female cohorts. The objective of this article is to review the oral health implications of HPV infection, including oral and oropharyngeal prevalence, manifestations, neoplastic potential of HPV-associated head and neck lesions, treatment modalities, and vaccine use. The article will also discuss the continuing education needs of oral healthcare providers. Dental professionals should routinely screen patients for oral and oropharyngeal manifestations of HPV infection, seek timely referral for therapeutic intervention of potentially malignant lesions, and become strong proponents of HPV vaccinations for at-risk patients.Recent advances in our understanding of T2 inflammation have revealed more diseases in which T2 inflammation is involved. Dupilumab is a recently developed monoclonal antibody that blocks signaling of IL-4 and IL-13, both of which are crucial cytokines in the T2 response. New possible indications are increasingly explored and include skin diseases, such as prurigo nodularis, nummular eczema, allergic contact dermatitis, chronic hand eczema, spontaneous chronic urticaria, bullous pemphigoid, alopecia areata, and Netherton syndrome, as well as respiratory diseases, such as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and allergic rhinitis. In addition, eosinophilic gastrointestinal disorders, particularly eosinophilic esophagitis, and food allergy, are also research fields of interest. Here, we review published data and clinical trials examining the use of dupilumab in these disorders.Fine control of protein stoichiometry at synapses underlies brain function and plasticity. How proteostasis is controlled independently for each type of synaptic protein in a synapse-specific and activity-dependent manner remains unclear. Here, we show that Susd4, a gene coding for a complement-related transmembrane protein, is expressed by many neuronal populations starting at the time of synapse formation. Constitutive loss-of-function of Susd4 in the mouse impairs motor coordination adaptation and learning, prevents long-term depression at cerebellar synapses, and leads to misregulation of activity-dependent AMPA receptor subunit GluA2 degradation. We identified several proteins with known roles in the regulation of AMPA receptor turnover, in particular ubiquitin ligases of the NEDD4 subfamily, as SUSD4 binding partners. Our findings shed light on the potential role of SUSD4 mutations in neurodevelopmental diseases.In mammals, HP1-mediated heterochromatin forms positionally and mechanically stable genomic domains even though the component HP1 paralogs, HP1Œ±, HP1Œ≤, and HP1Œ≥, display rapid on-off dynamics. Here, we investigate whether phase-separation by HP1 proteins can explain these biological observations. Using bulk and single-molecule methods, we show that, within phase-separated HP1Œ±-DNA condensates, HP1Œ± acts as a dynamic liquid, while compacted DNA molecules are constrained in local territories. These condensates are resistant to large forces yet can be readily dissolved by HP1Œ≤. Finally, we find that differences in each HP1 paralog's DNA compaction and phase-separation properties arise from their respective disordered regions. Our findings suggest a generalizable model for genome organization in which a pool of weakly bound proteins collectively capitalize on the polymer properties of DNA to produce self-organizing domains that are simultaneously resistant to large forces at the mesoscale and susceptible to competition at the molecular scale."

The education and training of healthcare workers (HCWs) about pandemic response plans, infection control protocols (ICP), and precautions are critical for breaking the virus transmission chain. This study aimed to assess the knowledge of HCWs regarding the COVID-19 pandemic response plan and the ICP. Concomitantly, evaluating the effectiveness and impact of institutional measures, policies, and training programs. A cross-sectional study using an electronic questionnaire was used to collect data from 267 HCWs at a University-affiliated-hospital during April 2020. In this study, 90.7% of participants were nurses and 66% were females. 60.3% of participants received specific training about caring for COVID-19 patients while at least 94.3% reviewed the pandemic response plan and ICP for COVID-19. 47.5% and 29.2% of participants provided direct care for suspected or confirmed COVID-19 patients, respectively. Between 85.7% and 100% of the participants answered all items correctly regarding the COVID-19 pandemic response plan, measures, and precautions. Furthermore, the correct answers were above 95% for each item. HCWs have a high level of knowledge about the COVID-19 pandemic response plan and ICP. Training and disseminating updated plans and protocols in different methods such as an intranet and onsite training in addition to regular methods were very effective.

Irrigation treatments consisted of a control, irrigation applied to fully satisfy crop evapotranspiration (100% ETC), and two SDI treatments 70% ETC (SDI70) and 50% ETC (SDI50). The effects of the SDI treatments differed between cultivars and years. During the first year, yield and fruit weight were significantly reduced in 'Sefri' under SDI50. The same effect was also observed in the second year under SDI70. In 'Wonderful', a significant decrease in yield occurred in the second year under both SDI regimes. Fruit juice content was reduced in both cultivars, particularly under SDI50, with no significant effect on fruit aril content and aril weight. As for juice chemical properties, it was observed a decrease in total soluble solids, especially under SDI50. Furthermore, a significant decrease in juice soluble sugars content was observed in the first year for both cultivars. Total polyphenols content has significantly diminished in the second year in both cultivars. Likewise, total anthocyanins level displayed the same pattern, particularly in 'Wonderful'. The findings suggest that SDI decreases yield and fruit quality even under moderate regime of 70% ETC. These negative effects may be dramatic depending on pomegranate genotypes, as observed in 'Sefri', compared to Wonderful variety. The great impact on species behavior toward water stress was particularly driven by the irrigation treatment, of which the interaction with the cultivar factor had the higher impact on the model. As many areas of how sustained deficit irrigation impacts pomegranate tree resilience are still needed to be investigated further, this study is a first attempt to explore water management in pomegranate in the Mediterranean semiarid lands.Gain-of-function mutations in voltage-gated sodium channels (NaV1.7, NaV1.8, and NaV1.9) are known causes of inherited pain disorders. Identification and functional assessment of new NaV1.7 mutations could help elucidate the phenotypic spectrum of NaV1.7 channelopathies. We identified a novel NaV1.7 mutation (E44Q in exon 2) that substitutes a glutamic acid residue for glutamine in the cytoplasmic N-terminus of NaV1.7 in a patient with paroxysmal pain attacks during childhood and his family who experienced similar pain episodes. To study the sodium channel's function, we performed electrophysiological recordings. Voltage-clamp recordings revealed that the mutation increased the amplitude of the non-inactivating component of the sodium current, which might facilitate channel opening. NDI-101150 solubility dmso These data demonstrate that E44Q is a gain-of-function mutation in NaV1.7, which is consistent with our patient's pain phenotype.Tillage, biochar, poultry manure, NPK fertilizer and their combined application could improve soil quality, sustainability and carrot productivity. The effects of two tillage treatments conventional tillage (CT) and reduced tillage (RT) each combined with 30 Mg ha-1 biochar (B), 10 Mg ha-1 poultry manure (PM), 300 kg ha-1 NPK 15-15-15 fertilizer, 150 kg ha-1 NPK 15-15-15 fertilizer +15 Mg ha-1 biochar +5 Mg ha-1 poultry manure and a control (no biochar/poultry manure/NPK fertilizer) on soil properties, growth and carrot yield were investigated. The research was carried out for two consecutive growing seasons (2018 and 2019) at Owo in the forest-savanna transition zone of Nigeria on a sandy loam. The experiment was laid out in a randomized complete block design in a factorial combination of ten treatments and replicated three times. Reduced tillage had relatively lower soil bulk density, penetration resistance, dispersion ratio and temperature, and had significantly higher (p = 0.05) soil aggregate stability, mean weight diameter, porosity and water content than conventional tillage and these resulted in higher soil pH, organic C, N, P, K, Ca and Mg, growth and fresh root yield of carrot compared with conventional tillage."

I would like to be emailed about offers, event and updates from Evening Standard. Read our privacy notice. If you're used to tracking your steps, sleep and heart rate with gadgets like Whoop bands and Oura rings, then get ready: the next step is to track your insides. Stride is a next-gen health optimisation company that tests your gut health, DNA, oral health and methylation (a biochemical process critical to numerous bodily functions) developed by former British Olympic athlete turned health tech entrepreneur Andrew Steele. The membership scheme, which launches this month, provides access to a health coach to analyse results and provide recommendations, then retests every six months to monitor progress and check for new symptoms. It is, as Steele says, the ‚ÄúUK's first diagnostics-driven, preventative health membership‚Äù. Stride, which costs ¬£499 per year, works by taking blood, DNA and gut microbiome tests (all of which you can do at home). Then you get a series of in-depth reports, along with a call with a health professional to provide dietary advice, supplementation and stress and exercise recommendations. The advantage of all this testing and tracking? ‚ÄúIt gives you a really accurate snapshot of your overall health, things that you can't necessarily see or feel, and lets you know if you need to take proactive preventative action. Or perhaps just how you can adjust your supplementation to optimise your health,‚Äù Steele says. It's part of what's being dubbed ‚ÄúMedicine 3.0‚Äù, or ‚Äúpreventing ill health, rather than waiting until you're sick,‚Äù Steele says. Steele, a sprinter who won bronze at the Beijing Games, was driven to develop the business because he felt frustrated at that lack of personalised health advice that he had been used to as a professional athlete. He saw a gap in the market between at-home tests that cost as little as ¬£30, but don't offer a doctor's analysis, and the high-end longevity clinics that cost thousands ‚ÄúWhere you get the most valuable insights is by testing and tracking over time,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúHistorically, that kind of service has been reserved for elite athletes or biohackers with big budgets.‚Äù I'm a health obsessive, so this in-depth testing and monitoring really appeals to me. I want to know exactly what I need to optimise my health. The first step is testing. A practitioner comes to my house to take my bloods, while I send off a swab from my mouth, and a stool sample, in the post. When my results come in, I log into my portal and see seven very clear pdfs of my results ranging from nutrition and fitness reports based on my genetic disposition, to gut microbiome reports. It included things like learning that I metabolise caffeine quickly (hurrah) and have a low sensitivity to carbs, as well as tendencies to higher oxidative stress, and recommendations such as an increased need for B vitamins and omega 3. But for a more in-depth take, I book in for a call with my new health coach, Bianca. My hour's call was an exhaustive deep dive into my innards, and incredibly helpful. She suggested supplements in some instances but was keen to stress dietary intake first where possible. And while you can buy supplements from Stride, she didn't offer up a shopping list until I asked. While the amount of information is slightly overwhelming, I came away with a few key pieces of advice. ‚ÄúWe focus on what are the big wins, work on those, and then see how that changes your health,‚Äù Steele says. As the platform develops, Steele says it will be offering integration with your other wearables, ‚Äúso that you've got all your data in one place‚Äù. He thinks there's huge potential for societal change. ‚ÄúIf over the next five years we can get 1‚Äâmillion people tracking their biology, then we'll be able to see what really moves the needle and feed that back to the general population.‚Äù Stride membership launches fully in September; getstride.com"

(Nasdaq: SDGR) today announced that SGR-1505, its clinical stage MALT1 inhibitor, was designated as a Fast Track product by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adult patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia that have failed at least two lines of therapy, including a Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor. 'We are excited to receive Fast Track designation for SGR-1505, which underscores the significant need in patients with Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia,' said Karen Akinsanya, Ph.D., president, head of therapeutics RD and chief strategy officer, partnerships at Schrodinger. ' Despite the continued therapeutic advances in the treatment of hematologic malignancies, treatment failure and disease progression due to BTK resistance remains a challenge for a growing number of patients. This unmet need represents an opportunity for novel mechanisms such as MALT1 as monotherapy and as part of new combination regimens.' 'We believe this Fast Track designation in Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, combined with our encouraging Phase 1 data across a broad range of relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, and marginal zone lymphoma, reinforce the potential of SGR-1505 as a future therapeutic option for patients,' said Margaret Dugan, chief medical officer at Schrodinger. ' We look forward to discussing our Phase 1 study results and recommended Phase 2 dose with the FDA later this year.' The FDA Fast Track program is designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of drug candidates to treat serious conditions and fill an unmet medical need. A drug granted Fast Track designation is eligible for multiple benefits, including more frequent meetings and written communications with the FDA, as well as eligibility for Accelerated Approval, Priority Review or Rolling Review, if relevant criteria are met. SGR-1505 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 clinical study as a treatment for patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. Initial data were recently presented at the European Hematology Association Annual Congress and International Conference on Malignant Lymphoma where SGR-1505 was observed to have a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated. Encouraging signs of preliminary efficacy were observed in multiple B-cell malignancy subtypes, including Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia patients, previously treated with a BTK inhibitor prior to starting SGR-1505. On August 11, 2023, the FDA granted orphan drug designation to SGR-1505 for Mantle Cell Lymphoma (MCL) based on preclinical data. About SGR-1505 SGR-1505 is an oral investigational MALT1 inhibitor being evaluated for the treatment of relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies. MALT1 plays a central role in key signaling pathways that drive cancer cell survival and proliferation, making its location downstream of BTK in the NF-? B signaling pathway an attractive target for the development of novel therapeutics for a potentially broad range of B-cell malignancies. In preclinical studies, SGR-1505 was observed to be highly potent and selective, and has demonstrated anti-tumor activity in preclinical models both as a monotherapy and in combination with BTK and BCL-2 inhibitors. There is also emerging therapeutic rationale supporting MALT1 inhibition as a potential treatment for inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. SGR-1505 was designed using Schrodinger's computational platform at scale and was discovered approximately 10 months after the company started its MALT1 program. A Phase 1 study in patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell malignancies is ongoing (NCT05544019). About Schrodinger Schrodinger is transforming molecular discovery with its computational platform, which enables the discovery of novel, highly optimized molecules for drug development and materials design. Schrodinger's software platform is built on more than 30 years of RD investment and is licensed by biotechnology, pharmaceutical and industrial companies, and academic institutions around the world.

CNN opacification scores were compared with Lund-MacKay (LM) visual scores, pulmonary function test results and other clinical variables using Spearman correlation and linear regression. RESULTS CNN scores were correlated with LM scores (rho = 0.82, p less then 0.001) and with forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) percentage predicted (rho = -0.21, p less then 0.001), FEV1 / forced vital capacity ratio (rho = -0.27, p less then 0.001), immunoglobulin E (rho = 0.20, p less then 0.001), eosinophil count (rho = 0.28, p less then 0.001) and exhaled nitric oxide (rho = 0.40, p less then 0.001). CONCLUSION Segmentation of the paranasal sinuses on CT can be automated using a CNN, providing truly objective, volumetric quantitation of sinonasal inflammation.

The main results were as follows (a) the cytostome was located on the ventral surface of the base of the beak, surrounded by a periportal matrix that integrated 135 microtube bundles. When these microtube bundles contract, radially arranged into a disk, the cytostome was closed. When these microtube bundles were stretch, they fell into the cytostome and opens. The diameter of the cytostome was about 16‚ÄâŒºm regardless of its closure or opening, indicating that the contraction or elongation of these microtube bundles did not change the size of the cytostome, which was only related to whether it blocked the cytostome, thus determining the opening and closing of the cytostome. There were many microtube bundles on two sides of the feeding trough, which could widen or narrow the feeding trough and facilitate beak feeding. (b) The cytopharynx wtrusomes could be also seen in the cytoplasm. (d) There were very well-developed fibrous systems under the pellicle that were woven from fibers about 0.14‚ÄâŒºm in diameter that attached to the pellicle and bound some organelles in the cytoplasm (e.g., mitochondria, extrusomes) and other structures to the cytoplasm and maintained cell morphology. The results of this study not only supplement and enrich the morphological contents of the Dileptus sp., but also provide the basis for the study of the taxonomy of the Dileptus sp. It also provides a new method for researchers to explore the morphology and structure of ciliate cells under the cortex by SEM. ¬© 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.Delayed graft function (DGF) is a common complication associated with significant untoward effects in kidney-alone transplantation. The incidence and outcomes following kidney delayed graft function (K-DGF) among patients undergoing simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation are less certain. We analyzed SPK recipients transplanted at our center between 01/1994 and 12/2017. A total of 632 recipients fulfilled the selection criteria, including 69 (11%) with K-DGF and 563 without. The incidence of K-DGF was significantly higher in recipients of organs from older donors and donation after circulatory death (DCD). The presence of K-DGF was significantly associated with an increased risk of pancreas graft failure during the first 90 days (n=9, Incidence rate, IR 2.45/100 person-months), but not with late pancreas failure (n=32, IR=0.84/100 person-months), kidney graft failure or patient death. Although DCD was associated with K-DGF, DCD was not associated with either pancreas (HR 0.91, 95% CI 0.58-1.44, p=0.69) or kidney (HR 1.09, 95% CI 0.66-1.82, p=0.74) graft failure after adjustment for potential confounders. We found K-DGF to be a significant risk factor for pancreas graft failure but not kidney graft failure, with the major risk period being early ( less then 90 days) post-transplant, and the major donor risk factor as older donor age.

AŒ≤ protein and phosphate buffer saline (PBS) were separately injected into the head of two groups of adult zebrafish (n = 6 per group). Congo-red staining results confirmed that AŒ≤ protein had penetrated into brain tissue. see more All zebrafish were imaged with OCT on the 0th, 5th, 10th, 15th and 20th day postinjection. OCT images showed that PBS is not toxic to brain tissue. However, significant brain atrophy could be seen in the OCT images of zebrafish injected with AŒ≤-protein that was verified by histological consequences. In addition, zebrafish in the model group showed memory decline in behavioral tests. This study verified the feasibility of in vivo long-term assessment of AŒ≤ protein-induced brain atrophy in adult zebrafish by OCT that has great potential to be applied in the neurological diseases research. ¬© 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

However, it is unclear whether the proximity of rehabilitation to acute services has an effect on rehabilitation outcomes. OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether the primary outcomes of an inpatient multi-trauma rehabilitation program (functional outcome and length of rehabilitation stay) are impacted when rehabilitation is delivered in a unit co-located in an acute hospital compared with in a unit located in a freestanding hospital. To also compare these outcomes at a national level using data provided by the Australasian Rehabilitation Outcomes Centre (AROC). DESIGN Observational, retrospective audit study.

This is the first study that integrates genomic alterations with a long follow-up of clinical variables in a Latin American population that is an underrepresented ethnicity in most of the genomic studies.This paper discusses the influence of Ti3C2 (MXene) addition on silicon nitride and its impact on the microstructure and mechanical properties of the latter. Composites were prepared through powder processing and sintered using the spark plasma sintering (SPS) technic. Relative density, hardness and fracture toughness, were analyzed. The highest fracture toughness at 5.3 MPa¬∑m1/2 and the highest hardness at HV5 2217 were achieved for 0.7 and 2 wt. % Ti3C2, respectively. Moreover, the formation of the Si2N2O phase was observed as a result of both the MXene addition and the preservation of the Œ±-Si3N4‚ÜíŒ≤-Si3N4 phase transformation during the sintering process.Current personalized treatment of neurological diseases is limited by availability of appropriate manufacturing methods suitable for long term sensors for neural electrical activities in the brain. An additive manufacturing process for polymer-based biocompatible neural sensors for chronic application towards individualized implants is here presented. To process thermal crosslinking polymers, the developed extrusion process enables, in combination with an infrared (IR)-Laser, accelerated curing directly after passing the outlet of the nozzle. As a result, no additional curing steps are necessary during the build-up. Furthermore, the minimal structure size can be achieved using the laser and, in combination with the extrusion parameters, provide structural resolutions desired. Active implant components fabricated using biocompatible materials for both conductive pathways and insulating cladding keep their biocompatible properties even after the additive manufacturing process. In addition, first characterization of the electric properties in terms of impedance towards application in neural tissues are shown. The printing toolkit developed enables processing of low-viscous, flexible polymeric thermal curing materials for fabrication of individualized neural implants.Abnormal activation of the Wnt/Œ≤-catenin pathway is common in many types of solid cancers. Likewise, a large proportion of cancer patients have vitamin D deficiency. In line with these observations, Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling and 1Œ±,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25(OH)2D3), the active vitamin D metabolite, usually have opposite effects on cancer cell proliferation and phenotype. In recent years, an increasing number of studies performed in a variety of cancer types have revealed a complex crosstalk between Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling and 1,25(OH)2D3. Here we review the mechanisms by which 1,25(OH)2D3 inhibits Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling and, conversely, how the activated Wnt/Œ≤-catenin pathway may abrogate vitamin D action. The available data suggest that interaction between Wnt/Œ≤-catenin signaling and the vitamin D system is at the crossroads in solid cancers and may have therapeutic applications.Tisochrysis lutea is a marine haptophyte rich in omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) and carotenoids (e.g., fucoxanthin). Because of the nutraceutical applications of these compounds, this microalga is being used in aquaculture to feed oyster and shrimp larvae. In our earlier report, T. lutea organic crude extracts exhibited in vitro cytotoxic activity against human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells. However, so far, the compound(s) accountable for the observed bioactivity have not been identified. Therefore, the aim of this study was to isolate and identify the chemical component(s) responsible for the bioactivity observed. Bioassay-guided fractionation through a combination of silica-gel column chromatography, followed by preparative thin layer chromatography (PTLC), led to the isolation of two diastereomers of a monoterpenoid lactone, namely, loliolide (1) and epi-loliolide (2), isolated for the first time in this species. The structural elucidation of both compounds was carried out by GC-MS and 1D (1H and 13C APT) and 2D (COSY, HMBC, HSQC-ed, and NOESY) NMR analysis. Both compounds significantly reduced the viability of HepG2 cells and were considerably less toxic towards a non-tumoral murine stromal (S17) cell line, although epi-loliolide was found to be more active than loliolide.This Special Issue on ""Single-cell Data Science"" aims to highlight recent advances in the area of single-cell sequencing technologies and data analytics [...]. A paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) episode developed in summer 2018 in the R√≠as Baixas (Galicia, NW Spain). The outbreak was associated with an unprecedentedly intense and long-lasting harmful algal bloom (HAB) (~one month) caused by the dinoflagellate Alexandrium minutum. Paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) were analyzed in extracts of 45 A.¬†Selleck Fulvestrant minutum strains isolated from the bloom by high-performance liquid chromatography with post-column oxidation and fluorescence detection (HPLC-PCOX-FLD). PSTs were also evaluated in tissues from marine fauna (invertebrates and fish) collected during the episode and in dolphin samples. The analysis of 45 A. minutum strains revealed a toxic profile including GTX1, GTX2, GTX3 and GTX4 toxins. With regard to the marine fauna samples, the highest PSTs levels were quantified in bivalve mollusks, but the toxins were also found in mullets, mackerels, starfish, squids and ascidians. This study reveals the potential accumulation of PSTs in marine invertebrates other than shellfish that could act as vectors in the trophic chain or pose a risk for human consumption. To our knowledge, this is the first time that PSTs are reported in ascidians and starfish from Spain. Moreover, it is the first time that evidence of PSTs in squids is described in Europe.Background and objectives In an aging society, the maintenance of the oral function of the elderly is of importance for the delay or prevention of frailty and long-term care. In the present study, we focused on the maximum tongue pressure (MTP) value and analyzed the relationship between MTP and age, occlusal status, or body mass index (BMI). Materials and Methods This one-center observatory study was conducted using a cohort consisting of 205 community-dwelling outpatients over 65 years old. The MTP values of all subjects were measured using a commercially available tongue pressure measurement device and statistically analyzed. In addition, the correlation between MTP value and BMI was analyzed. Results The MTP value decreased with age, especially in subjects classified as Eichner B and C. The difference in occlusal status did not show any statistically significant influence on MTP value. The correlation between BMI and MTP value was indicated in the tested groups other than an age of 65-74 and Eichner A groups."

Main group included 75 patients with HF and HU. 51 patients with HF without HU were included in the control group. All patients underwent to a standardized clinical evaluation, including physical examination, determination of NYHA class and laboratory studies; namely, full blood count, serum uric acid, creatinine and ferritin. Assessment of exercise capacity was performed using a 6-min walk test. Echocardiographic assessment included interventricular septum thickness, left ventricular systolic and diastolic dimensions, left ventricular diastolic function, posterior wall thickness, left ventricular mass index and LVEF. Patients with HU had higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus than patients without HU. Patients with HU had significantly lower LVEF (38.2¬±7.0 and 44.5¬±5.1; respectively. P less then 0.05). No differences were recorded for b and independent association with reduced exercise capacity, it is highly recommended to define HU level in all the patients with chronic heart failure to avoid future complications.The aim was to study the effects of non-functional overreaching and overtraining on responses of biomarkers of the skeletal muscle cell (CK-NAC) and cardiomyocyte injury (cTnI and CK-MB) and their use in monitoring OTS. In 43 athletes with non-functional overreaching (NFO)/overtraining syndrome (OTS) and 40 athletes without NFO/OTS -control athletes (CA) off-season measurements of creatine kinaze (CK-NAC and CK-MB) were performed, followed by peak-season evaluation of the dynamic of CK-NAC, CK-MB and cardiac troponin I (cTnI) changes. CK and cTnI levels were obtained 24 hrs before the strenuous exercise appropriate to the sport-specific peak-season intensity, immediately after completion of the work-load, after 6, 48, and 72hrs. Baseline and post-exercise clinical assessment and echocardiography were performed in 6 and 48 hrs after strenuous session. Similar rising trend of CK-NAC, CK-MB, and cTnI levels was observed immediately after exercise, reaching peak values after 6 hours in all athletes, though, signile and transient increase of the CK-MB and cTnI, without irreversible pathophysiological and clinical consequences, suggesting mostly benign cardiac involvement, though amplified by existent oxidative stress in athletes with OTS. Monitoring responses via alterations of biochemical parameters can be helpful to guide athletic training, and prevent OTS or interrupt NFO to OTS progression.132 women after facial contouring on terms from 2 weeks to 15 years after filler injection were examined by sonography (US). They had complaints of the edema, hypercorrection, asymmetry, discomfort and anxiety about the excess of the terms that filler had spent into the soft tissues. HA fillers were injected in 111 cases (84.1%), silicon agents - in 13 cases (9.8%), CaHA - in 6 (4.5%), PMMA - on 1 (0.8%) and one patient have had non-hyalouronic filler with unknown origin (0.8%). selleck inhibitor According to the US data, nasolacrimal and palpebromar fissures were the most common location of fillers or the echo signs of fibrotic changes in the projection of their injection - 54 patients, just like the lips region and nasolabial folds - 52 cases.

Changes in the total antioxidant activity of blood and saliva can be multidirectional - an increase or decrease in the oral fluid indicator and a reduction in the parameter of blood plasma can be recorded. To resolve the emerging difficulties, there was proposed a parallel assessment of the dynamics of changes in the total antioxidant activity of blood plasma and oral fluid in the patients of 4 groups with nosological forms of fundamentally different in the distribution and localization of the pathological process, which include phlegmons of the maxillofacial region, partial absence of teeth, type 2 diabetes mellitus and the pelvic inflammatory diseases. As a result of the conducted studies, it was shown that a simultaneous decrease in the total antioxidant activity of blood plasma and oral fluid was attributable to the chronic long-term somatic diseases of a systemic characitation only to the dentoalveolar system's tissues and elements. As an example of such a situation, the patients with phlegmon of the maxillofacial region or patients with partial absence of teeth can be cited.Excessive tooth wear is currently one of the main problems of oral health. Excessive tooth wear affects both function and aesthetics. Teeth with excessive tooth wear cannot be effectively used for biting and chewing food. Treating excessive tooth wear is complex and time consuming. Studies on increasing the effectiveness of treatment of such patients are relevant. The study involved 60 people with a significant degree of excessive tooth wear and a decrease in the height of the bite. We examined patients using measurements of the electromyographic (EMG) activity of mm.masseter and temporalis. The subjects were divided into two groups - in the first group (30 people), the maxillofacial system was prepared for further prosthetics by wearing a removable dental splint-teethguard, in the second group (30 people) we used both removable splint-teethguards and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). In both groups, an electromyographic study of mm.masseter and temporalis was performed after 1 week, 1 and 2 months of treatment. In patients with excessive tooth wear and a significant decrease in bite height, our method of preparation for orthopedic treatment contributed to a more rapid normalization of mm.masseter and temporalis functions. The results indicate a pronounced positive effect of the use of removable teeth guard and TENS on the normalization of the bioelectric activity of the masticatory muscles in the preparation of patients for orthopedic treatment of excessive tooth wear."

Birmingham, United States, June 30, 2025 -- The newly published guide outlines emergency protocols and prevention tips to help parents manage dental emergencies in children, offering practical steps for urgent oral care. Interested parties can visit  https://hurstpediatricdental.com/blog/b/children-dental-emergencies. Hurst Pediatric Dentistry's guide is intended to address growing concerns about parents' responses to sudden dental problems. The guide covers situations from knocked-out teeth to severe toothaches, offering clear instructions for immediate care. Research shows that pediatric dental emergencies make up a significant portion of all children's dental visits, with tooth pain and trauma being the most common reasons children and their parents seek urgent care. Studies indicate that about one-third of young children experience dental fear and anxiety, making parent preparedness crucial during stressful moments. Dr. Joby Hurst, the lead dentist at Hurst Pediatric Dentistry, who has treated children in Birmingham for over 25 years, says parents often struggle during dental emergencies. ""We see families arrive at our office in distress because they didn't know what steps to take at home,"" Dr. Hurst explained. ""This guide gives parents the knowledge they need to respond effectively and feel more secure in their children's dental health."" The resource includes protocols for various dental emergencies, providing parents with clear steps to take during different situations that require immediate attention. Each section focuses on helping families respond calmly and effectively while seeking professional care. Families with children who have special needs or sensory sensitivities receive additional support through modified approaches designed for children who may react strongly to unfamiliar situations. ""Children with autism or developmental delays may need different support during dental emergencies,"" Dr. Hurst noted. ""We included specific strategies to help all families feel prepared."" Prevention strategies form a significant part of the resource. The guide explains how regular dental visits, protective gear during sports, and good oral hygiene can reduce the likelihood of dental emergencies. The resource also provides recommendations for creating a home dental emergency kit. About Dr. Joby Hurst Dr. Hurst completed his residency at UAB and became a Diplomate of the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry in 2002. His practice serves infants, children, teenagers, and patients with special needs throughout Birmingham.

(Or creepy depending on how you interpret it) Anyways, I have been an Instacart shopper on and off since 2021 and I have never seen anything as perplexing as this. There is a customer in my area who orders multiple times a day and has over 2300 total orders over time. His orders and the items he orders are so consistent that I know it's him before I even accept the batch. The first time I delivered to him, it was 4 Swiffer Wet Jets and a few packs of gloves from Home Depot. I didn't really think anything of it, maybe he has a cleaning business, whatever. When I arrived at this guys house, I kid you not there were at least 20 other deliveries at his door. I would come to find out that there's always at least 20 other deliveries at his door. Craziest part is that there were FIVE OTHER SWIFFER WET JETS already on the porch!!!!!!!! I was super confused but could not come up with any sort of logical conclusion in my head. The next time I delivered to him, it was a few reams of paper and a ~$400 shark vacuum. Low and fucking behold this man has at least 10 of those exact same vacuums in his detached garage. This is the only thing I have a photo of but it's attached. These are the items he orders large quantities of multiple times a day: - compostable silverware - Fiji water bottles - clear solo cups - reams of paper - oral B toothbrushes - Swiffer wet jets - shark vacuums - gloves What the HELL do you guys think this man is doing with this stuff? These are the conclusions I have tried to draw but eventually debunked. I don't feel comfortable enough to just ask him either. - He's one of those doomsday believers and is prepping for when the day comes: this doesn't explain the vacuums/swiffers or reams of paper really - He's reselling these items: when I saw the vacuums through the window they were all unpackaged, also none of these items have been on sale so i can't imagine he would be buying them at face value and then reselling them for more if someone could just buy it at the store - Credit card fraud: this doesn't make sense because he has been ordering multiple times a day for months, also he has had to sign for every vacuum and if that was the case theres no way they wouldn't have caught it by now. Genuinely, I am stumped. I know this might sound fake but it couldn't be more real and I am nosy. . Please feel free to share any thoughts or ask questions because I am trying to get to the bottom of this!!!"

mov_2F1BFD53466777C7D1F921761F9C71AC,2025-07-01 08:16:04,en,WEB,"‚Äâ AI appears to be a theme with a high trigger value. Understandably so; it surely challenges our belief of being the apex species on this planet. However, some time ago I wrote some lines on possible Tango futures ( Some thoughts about ‚ÄûQuo vadis,¬†Tango? ‚Äú), and therein, also a speculation about AI being trained to play like EdO tango orchestras (not weirder than Carsten's ""dance robots"", in my view). Also, a couple of days ago I posted a contribution in a private Facebook group (TTango DJ Forum) suggesting a thought experiment: Take a piece of music sounding like di Sarli (and with sounding, I mean, meant to have the same emotional effect), play it to people and ask them about their opinion. And then, telling them one of three stories: a) the piece is a previously lost authentic di Sarli recording; b) it is a contemporary orchestra which has found out how to play like di Sarli; c) the song has been generated by an AI which has been trained on the entire work of di Sarli. There was a lot of response, and some of that had a quite high emotional temperature. I am not going to cite specific texts because I want to respect the closed nature of that group. However, the range went from ""if it works, it is okay"" to white-hot rage about desecration of di Sarli's memory, including some rather weird extrapolations of my original thought with the probable intent to ""silence"" it that way. Perhaps I have mentioned before that I am a physicist by education. As I believe, heated debates are the essence of progress, not only in science (as long as it does not escalate into people shooting at each other, of course). Of course I am also a hedonist; a friend once said that obviously my genome contains less Chimpanzee and more Bonobo than usual. But it is the mix of both that brings us forward. Whatever. This morning I came upon a YouTube video dealing with AI generated music. https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Nlb-m_vKYM      The author uses a quite clever way to check if the music in question might be AI generated. No matter if it is or not: probably it is only a matter of time before AI-generated orchestras appear. Of course, there is the music industry, with a rather large financial firepower and ready to use it to protect their copyright interests, so it is going to be interesting; my guess is that there will be some kind of win-win construction. How about the Tango subsector? It is simply too small and financially unimportant to mobilize much in the way of resources. Impacts will probably be more in the way of collateral effects - if the state of the art is sufficiently developed, sooner or later, someone will apply it to the Tango music world. Which brings us to a second ""aspect of the AI in Tango"" debate - AI-enhanced DJing. All the experiments I know about (including my own) show that currently, Tango DJs have nothing to fear from AI. I asked ChatGPT about it: ""why is chatgpt so bad in creating tango tandas?"" And this was what I got:     Great question‚Äîand a fair critique if you've had a disappointing experience. Creating tango tandas (sets of songs played in sequence during a milonga) is notoriously nuanced, and here's why ChatGPT might not meet expectations out of the box:         Why It Struggles     Lack of Musical Context Tango DJs rely on deep musical knowledge: tempo, mood, orchestration, vocal vs. instrumental, and even the emotional arc across songs. GPT doesn't inherently ""hear"" music or feel phrasing‚Äîso it can't judge how a Troilo with Fiorentino might contrast too sharply with a later Di Sarli vocal track. Limited DJ Practice Data There's relatively little publicly available, high-quality data about how expert tango DJs build tandas. Much of the skill is oral tradition or personal experience, not documented online in a way GPT can learn from well. Lack of Local/Regional Awareness Milonga culture varies wildly‚ÄîBuenos Aires vs. Berlin vs. Tokyo. What feels ‚Äúperfect‚Äù in one setting might fall flat elsewhere. GPT doesn't know your crowd unless you tell it. Balance Issues A good tanda isn't just four good songs‚Äîit's a balanced emotional and rhythmic journey. GPT might throw together four Pugliese instrumentals and call it a day, but that's a recipe for a heart attack on the dance floor. How to Get Better Results     You can absolutely use GPT to help build tandas, but you'll want to:     Specify the orchestra, era, singer, and energy Example: ""Build a 4-song tanda of early 1940s rhythmic D'Agostino with Vargas, ending on a strong emotional finish."" State the type of milonga or crowd E.g., ""This is for a relaxed afternoon milonga for intermediate dancers in Berlin."" Ask for alternatives or reasons ""Why does this tanda work emotionally?"" or ""Give me a calmer alternative for the 3rd track."" Cross-check the flow Listen to the selections yourself or run them by a human DJ. Think of GPT as your assistant, not the DJ. So there are some hints - such as providing suitable metrics to characterize music from their emotional effect. Of course, if we assume that sooner or later AI will be able to detect this by actually analyzing the audio signal, this will not be necessary anymore. The really interesting part here is, however, something different. It is useful to have a sort of ""game theory""-wise look at it. Clearly, it would benefit the Tango world as a whole if every milonga is providing the best possible musical and therefore emotional experience to dancers. It would keep dancers inside the community, they would radiate their pleasure, thereby helping to attract new dancers - in short, the better the milongas, the more benefit for the entire Tango ecosphere. Obviously, Tango DJs come in different flavors and quality levels. Organizers should have an interest to select the best ones; they are, however, in short supply. From the viewpoint of a good TDJ, sharing his know-how is probably not the best strategy. It may increase his status inside the community, but also is likely to hurt his commercial interests by lowering his uniqueness...."

Unfortunately, only one in five patients with metastatic urothelial cancer responds to anti-programmed death ligand-1 ([AQ1]anti-PD-1) monotherapy. Preclinical and early clinical evidence indicates that radiotherapy not only acts locally, but also exerts systemic anti-tumour effects by modulating the immune system. It is hypothesised that combining checkpoint inhibitors with radiotherapy might enhance an anti-tumour immune response and increase response rates. So far, a handful of early phase clinical trials have been performed seeking to answer this question in urothelial cancer patients. The current review summarises the available preclinical and clinical evidence on radiotherapy/immunotherapy combinations in locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer and suggests future avenues worthy of exploration.Guillain-Barr√© syndrome (GBS) is the most prevalent cause of acquired paralytic neuropathy in children, however, ataxia as the initial presenting sign in children is very rare. Antiganglioside antibodies are presumed to have an important role in the pathophysiology and some phenotypic correlations have been reported. Anti-GM2 antibody, unlike other antibodies, is far less detected in GBS. Here, we report a 7.5-year-old female, initially presenting with ataxia, an atypical presenting symptom in a child, is promptly diagnosed and treated successfully as GBS. Atypical history of urinary infection in our patient is an interesting aspect. The presence of isolated anti-GM2 IgM antibody and ataxia in a pediatric patient is rare. In this case report, we aim to describe an atypical initial presentation, with positive anti-GM2 antibodies, as well as review literature on isolated anti-GM2 positive pediatric GBS patients.This review is intended to highlight some of the historic events that contributed to the development of thoracic and cardiac anesthesia and surgery in Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK). The aim of this first of two parts is to concentrate on the development of techniques, facilities, and pharmacology that allowed progress and advancement in patient management that were developed primarily in the UK. However, progress usually requires input from a wide variety of sources of knowledge, and cardiothoracic practice is no exception. Reference is, thus, made to sources outside of the UK that guided, influenced, or inspired changes in practice, such as the techniques of operating on the heart and great vessels in war casualties, developed by Dr. Dwight Harken, or the demonstration of the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt by Alfred Blalock. In addition to advances in medical equipment, such as computed tomography, the UK contributed greatly to pharmacologic interventions that were unique at the time in such varied areas as nonflammable volatile anesthetic agents, heart failure treatments, and neuromuscular blocking agents for both cardiac and thoracic surgical practice.The use and evolution of oral anticoagulation therapies continue to advance for multiple reasons, including a growing segment of older patients with associated chronic prothrombotic illnesses including cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and oncologic conditions. Correlated to this increased use of oral anticoagulants is bleeding complications associated with their use. Based on these trends, it is expected that perioperative physicians will be facing more and more of these patients requiring scheduled, urgent or emergent surgical procedures During May 2020, the American College of Cardiology updated its Expert Consensus Decision Pathway devoted to the approach of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants. This updated version emphasized the expanding role of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants in other conditions beyond nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, such as venous thromboembolism. Several details discussed within this most recent update are pertinent to perioperative physicians, who frequently deal with bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation. The purpose of this narrative review is to highlight and expand on these salient points because they relate to perioperative management. For kidney transplant patients, incisional hernia (IH) is a major complication resulting from prolonged pretransplant dialysis, immunosuppressive drugs, and the high prevalence of diabetes. However, there have been relatively few studies of IH after kidney transplantation (KT) in Japan and in the greater Asian population. Additionally, operative methods for IH repair have not been established. We retrospectively analyzed 465 consecutive patients who underwent KT at our hospital from April 2013 to March 2019. Patients who underwent incisional hernia repair were included in this study, and the follow-up time was extended to September 2020. check details We defined severe IH as an IH requiring surgical repair. We examine the risk factors for severe IH among KT patients and also discuss the operative methods of IH repair. During the study period, 7 patients developed severe IH after KT. The cumulative occurrence rate for severe IH was 1.1% 1 year postoperatively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that age at KT and dialysis duration (hazard ratio=1.112, P=.016; hazard ratio=1.106, respectively; P=.038) were independent risk factors for severe IH. We used polypropylene mesh for IH repair in all cases, with onlay repair performed in 5 of 7 cases. There was no recurrence or infection after mesh repair during follow-up. In this study, age at KT and dialysis duration were independent risk factors for severe IH in the Japanese population. Onlay repair with a polypropylene mesh appeared to be a safe and acceptable operation for IH repair after KT.

A retrospective study was undertaken to assess correlations between the overlap of the R/B with the planning target volume (PTV) and the dose received during planning to organs at risk (OARs). Data for 105 prostate cancer patients who had volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to the intact prostate and proximal seminal vesicles at Nepean Cancer Care Centre from 2011 to 2015 were analyzed. R/B volume, R/B-PTV overlap volume, and R/B-PTV overlap percent metrics were collected with VMAT planning objectives. Characteristics were evaluated for correlation with different planning outcomes. The percentage overlap between the R/B and PTV were highly correlated to the doses to the relevant OAR, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.63 for the rectum volume percentage receiving more than 75 Gy (RV75Gy) and R2 of 0.91 for the bladder volume percentage receiving more than 70 Gy (BV70Gy)."

The review was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 365 articles were found in the main scientific databases. Applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 11 studies were admitted to the final phase of the review. Three different rehabilitative approaches were identified physical training, respiratory training, and balance training. All rehabilitative modalities contributed to enhancing functional outcomes, reducing fatigue, and improving quality of life, but currently none can be recommended over another for the lack of cross-comparative studies. The included studies showed methodological quality from low to fair. Despite the range of rehabilitative interventions available, there is a lack of high-quality evidence. However, this review suggests that a multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach should be recommended to people with myasthenia gravis, and above all, for those with mild to moderate symptomatology.One of the main goals of diabetic therapy is to achieve the best metabolic control to prevent the development and progression of potential complications. A multidisciplinary approach characterized by the combination of diet, physical activity (PA) and drug therapy with oral and injectable (non-insulin) pharmacological agents, is desirable to optimize metabolic control. The aim of this review is to explain the contribution of PA and its beneficial effects on patients affected by type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We provide an overview of evidence on the effects of PA for the main two types of diabetes mellitus (DM) to identify the right level of PA to be recommended. We discuss the physiological and clinical role of PA in people with DM. It can be concluded that the objective of antidiabetic therapy should be the achievement and optimization of metabolic control through a multidisciplinary approach involving non-pharmacological therapy such as diet and PA, which has a crucial role.The ongoing Coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic abruptly halted athletic competition and standard training practices, consequently generating great confusion surrounding when and how to safely reintroduce sports. Therefore, tangible solutions disseminated to performance staff, coaches, and athletes are warranted to ensure optimal levels of health and physical performance for all personnel during both the current social distancing standards as well as the impending return of competition despite continued risks. In this commentary, we offer strategies for utilizing technology and data tools as components of longitudinal COVID-19 surveillance based on ongoing research efforts as well as current guidance from governing bodies, while also serving the performance needs of the athletes and staff. Recommended data sources include digital symptom and well-being surveys, standardized and routine physical performance testing, sleep and sleep physiology monitoring, cognitive applications, and temperature. This system is flexible to numerous commercially available products and is designed for easy implementation that permits instant feedback provided directly to the athlete as well as their support staff for early intervention, ultimately mitigating COVID-19 risks. We will discuss multiple options, including examples of data, data visualizations and recommendations for data interpretation and communication.In this editorial, we focus on recent problematic developments in sport science, and more specifically, problems related to periodization research. Primary areas discussed are (1) appreciation of history, (2) considerations for training studies, (3) the development of concepts, and (4) programming-driven training models.This study aimed to investigate the effect of dehydration on archery performance, subjective feelings and heart rate response. Ten national level archers performed two archery competition simulations, once under euhydration (EUH) and once in a dehydrated state (DEH), induced by 24-h reduced fluid intake. Hydration status was verified prior to each trial by urine specific gravity (USG ‚â• 1.025). Archery score was measured according to official archery regulations. Subjective feelings of thirst, fatigue and concentration were recorded on a visual analogue scale. Heart rate was continuously monitored during the trials. Archery performance was similar between trials (p = 0.155). During DEH trial (USG 1.032 ¬± 0.005), the athletes felt thirstier (p¬†less then¬†0.001), more fatigued (p = 0.041) and less able to concentrate (p = 0.016) compared with the EUH trial (USG 1.015 ¬± 0.004). Heart rate during DEH at baseline (85 ¬± 5 b‚àômin-1) was higher (p = 0.021) compared with EUH (78 ¬± 6 b‚àômin-1) and remained significantly higher during the latter stages of the DEH compared to EUH trial. In conclusion, archery performance over 72 arrows was not affected by dehydration, despite the induced psychological and physiological strain, revealed from decreased feeling of concentration, increased sensation of fatigue and increased heart rate during the DEH trial.Long-term heavy physical work often leads to early retirement and disability pension due to chronic overload, with a need to define upper limits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of the first lactate threshold (LTP1) as a physiological marker for heavy occupational work. A total of 188 male and 52 female workers performed an incremental cycle ergometer test to determine maximal exercise performance and the first and second lactate (LTP1; LTP2) and ventilatory thresholds (VT1; VT2). Heart rate (HR) recordings were obtained during one eight-hour shift (HR8h) and oxygen uptake was measured during 20 minutes of a representative work phase. Energy expenditure (EE) was calculated from gas-exchange measures. Maximal power output (Pmax), maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and power output at LTP1 and LTP2 were significantly different between male and female workers. HR8h was not significantly different between male and female workers. A significant relationship was found between Pmax and power output at LTP1."

mov_B5E47729D623A012C12A295ACCAC3A23,2025-07-01 15:17:54,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Abstract Background: Patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing splenectomy exhibit a high incidence of portal venous system thrombosis (PVST). Therapeutic interventions may prevent PVST development. This Bayesian network meta-analysis systematically evaluates the efficacy and safety of diverse anticoagulation regimens for PVST prophylaxis. Methods: In accordance with the PRISMA-NMA statement and PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and other databases from their inception to March 1, 2025, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating interventions to prevent PVST after splenectomy in cirrhotic patients. Artificial intelligence-assisted screening was conducted using the AS Review tool. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to synthesize preventive effect estimates across interventions. Results: Initial database searches identified 636 records, with 6 RCTs (557 patients) meeting inclusion criteria. Five interventions were evaluated, with the primary outcome being PVST incidence and secondary outcomes including main portal vein thrombosis (MPVT) and splenic vein thrombosis (SVT). Analyses demonstrated that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), specifically apixaban, demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing PVST, MPVT, and SVT rates at postoperative time points (7 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months). However, the certainty of evidence for this conclusion was rated as low. In contrast, the evidence certainty for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) combined with warfarin was assessed as moderate. Conclusions: Current evidence indicates that for Child-Pugh class A/B cirrhosis patients undergoing splenectomy, the combination of LMWH and warfarin should be considered as the first-line anticoagulation strategy for PVST. While existing evidence remains insufficient to elevate DOACs, particularly apixaban, to a higher prioritization level, they demonstrate promising therapeutic potential.

But can these viewpoint-based refusals survive under the ""failure-to-function"" doctrine instead? Background: ¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠Supreme Court Struck Down Bar on Registration of ""Disparaging,"" ""Immoral,"" and ""Scandalous"" Marks Eight years ago, in Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744 (2017), the United States Supreme Court struck down the Lanham Act's bar on registering trademarks that ""disparage"" persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols. The Court's decision in Tam was in response to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)'s refusal to register an Asian American band's name, ""THE SLANTS."" There, the Court held that: (1) viewpoint-based trademark restrictions are unconstitutional under the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause; and (2) the disparagement clause was viewpoint-based and, therefore, unconstitutional. Two years later, in Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388 (2019), the Supreme Court heard Erik Brunetti's challenge to a neighboring provision of the Lanham Act: the ban on registering ""immoral or scandalous"" marks. In that case, Brunetti sought to register the name of his clothing brand ""F-U-C-T."" While pronounced as four discrete letters, the government alleged that the applied-for mark was ""the equivalent of the . . . past participle form of a well-known"" obscenity. There, the Court held that the bar on registering ""immoral or scandalous"" trademarks constituted viewpoint discrimination and was, consequently, a violation of the First Amendment. The USPTO Subsequently Invoked the ""Failure-to-Function"" Doctrine as a Basis for Refusing Brunetti's Applications for ""F***"" In addition to his application for the mark ""FUCT,"" Erik Brunetti filed four intent-to-use applications for the mark ""F***"" (spelled and pronounced as the present tense form of FUCT) in connection with various consumer goods and associated retail store services. While Brunetti's application for the mark ""FUCT"" was pending before the Supreme Court in Iancu v. Brunetti, his concurrent intent-to-use applications for F*** were suspended by the examining attorney assigned to review the applications. Upon resolution of Brunetti, the USPTO examining attorney re-examined the applications and subsequently refused registration based on a conclusion that the applied-for mark ""fails to function"" as a trademark. Notably, this basis for refusal was not raised until after the Court's Brunetti decision, striking the ""immoral or scandalous"" basis of refusal as impermissibly viewpoint-based. The Examiner Found That the Applied-For Mark is ""Commonly Used"" and Thus Less Likely to be Perceived as a Source Identifier In support of the foregoing ""failure-to-function"" refusals, the examining attorney offered evidence in the form of articles and dictionary definitions, which, according to the examiner, ""illustrates that the term is commonly used as a versatile expression conveying a wide range of emotion, from disdain to joy."" See Examiner's Brief Filed with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board at p. 12, available here. The examining attorney argued that ""[b]ecause consumers are accustomed to seeing this term or expression commonly used in everyday speech by many different sources, they would not perceive the use of the term as a mark identifying the source of Applicant's goods and/or services but rather as only conveying an informational message or sentiment."" The Examiner Relied on Evidence Showing Ornamental Use of the Applied-For Mark The examiner also sought out and relied upon evidence from third-party sources such as Amazon and Etsy to show the word ""F***"" used in a decorative or ornamental fashion on several of the goods listed in Brunetti's applications, including phone cases, jewelry, wallets, and tote bags. The examiner explained such evidence ""illustrates that many competitors use the term as an informational message on jewelry, bags, phone cases, and many other items"" and that ""[t]o allow the Applicant to appropriate the term for its proposed goods and services would prevent competitors from using the commonplace term to promote their own goods and services."" The Refusal Survived Appeal The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB or Board) upheld the examiner's refusal of the marks based on a failure to function. In doing so, the Board found that the evidence of record establishes that the applied-for word ""F***"" expresses well-recognized familiar sentiments and that relevant consumers are accustomed to seeing the word in widespread use on the types of goods identified in Brunetti's applications. Accordingly, the Board concluded that the word ""F***"" does not function as a trademark distinguishing Brunetti's goods and services in commerce. Brunetti Asserted ""Failure-to-Function"" is a ""Novel"" Doctrine Used to Circumvent Bans on Viewpoint-Based Refusals In response to the Board's decision, Brunetti asserted that failure-to-function is an ""invalid"" substantive refusal lacking statutory basis. Brunetti accused the USPTO of weaponizing a procedural doctrine to ""evade the Supreme Court's decisions"" in Tam and Brunetti, thereby creating a new backdoor substantive doctrine. Under this well-established procedural doctrine, if a submitted specimen ""demonstrates merely ornamental use"" of an applied-for mark, then the USPTO can issue a refusal of the mark for failing to function as a trademark. In his briefings, Brunetti argued that the USPTO has since expanded this procedural refusal to create a ""novel, substantive doctrine"" under which some words can never be registered. He noted that ""it was not a coincidence"" that these same words ""would have been refused under Section 2(a) prior to Tam and Brunetti."" In addition to asserting that the new failure-to-function doctrine was invalid, Brunetti contended that it lacked consistent standards and contradicted ""fundamental principles of trademark law."" Brunetti alleged that the refusals of his applications were ""predetermined,"" as evidenced by the USPTO's continuous ""discovery of new grounds."" Illustrating this point, Brunetti pointed to the justifications offered by the USPTO for why ""F***"" could not be registered and explained how the evidence did not support their rationale. Brunetti submitted that all of the USPTO's evidence of ""use"" was ornamental, which cannot ""preclude a term from being perceived as a trademark."" On the contrary, Brunetti pointed to examples of other ""widely used"" words and phrases that are registered: ""LOVE,"" ""APPLE,"" and ""DELTA."" Consequently, Brunetti argued that if the USPTO's approach was correct, these words should also be unregistrable. Federal Circuit Expressed Skepticism During Oral Arguments On March 10, 2025, a panel of Federal Circuit judges heard oral arguments on behalf of Mr. Brunetti and the USPTO. During oral arguments, the court questioned how the USPTO could judge how a mark would be perceived by consumers, where, as here, the mark is not yet being used by the applicant in connection with its goods and services. Notably, in its briefing, the USPTO criticized Brunetti for failing to present evidence that consumers would perceive the word ""F***"" as a source identifier. However, when asked during oral arguments what type of evidence Brunetti was supposed to present to show consumer perception, the attorney for the USPTO failed to provide any examples. Instead, the USPTO's attorney opined that ""it would probably be difficult given the nature of this particular proposed mark in the classes for which [Brunetti] has applied for it, to demonstrate that consumers are going to understand it as, as a trademark.""

mov_3AF3BDABEB443A6BDB2AB0F48BABD476,2025-07-01 17:00:00,en,WEB,"‚Äâ BOISE, Idaho, July 01, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Idaho Power Company (Idaho Power), a wholly owned subsidiary of IDACORP, Inc. (NYSE: IDA), has released its latest long-range energy plan, which forecasts unprecedented growth in energy demand and lays out the preferred options for serving customers. The 2025 Integrated Resource Plan was filed with state regulators Friday. It shows that the company needs to add significant energy resources, transmission, battery storage, and energy efficiency. The public utility commissions in Idaho and Oregon will set a schedule for public review and comment before deciding to acknowledge the plan. ""The IRP is a really detailed analysis of how we are going to continue serving our customers with safe, reliable, affordable energy in a responsible way,"" said Idaho Power Resource Planning Leader Jared Hansen, who oversees the IRP process. The utility's preferred portfolio of resources focuses on least-cost and reliability-enhancing generation and transmission projects with an eye toward further reducing wildfire risk. Growth continues to be driven by increases in population as well as a broad range of commercial and industrial expansion and development across the company's service area. Although new large-demand customers are required to pay for their own costs of interconnecting to the company's system to receive electric service, the company still must plan how best to provide that service while continuing to maintain and improve the electrical grid. ""Our plan really highlights the work we are doing to identify resources that will provide safe, reliable energy for our customers at the lowest cost over the long term,"" said Mitch Colburn, Idaho Power Vice President of Planning, Engineering, and Construction. ""We look at a wide range of potential resources that will serve all of our customers well into the future."" Over the next 20 years, the company's peak demand is expected to grow nearly 45% or 1,700 megawatts (MW), with nearly 1,000 MW of that total coming in the next five years. That 5-year increase in demand is nearly 50% more than the capacity of the company's single largest energy source, the Brownlee hydropower plant. The IRP also highlights the need for more transmission line infrastructure, specifically the Boardman to Hemingway and Southwest Intertie projects, which are 500-kilovolt lines that will enable the company to import energy when customer demand for electricity is high. Idaho Power enlists the assistance of its customers in developing the IRP through an advisory panel ‚Äî the Integrated Resource Plan Advisory Council (IRPAC). The IRPAC includes major industrial customers, the environmental community, irrigation representatives, state and local elected officials, public utility commission representatives, and other interested parties. The IRP is available at idahopower.com/irp. Background Information IDACORP, Inc. (NYSE: IDA), Boise, Idaho-based and formed in 1998, is a holding company comprised of Idaho Power, a regulated electric utility; IDACORP Financial, an investor in affordable housing and other real estate tax credit investments; and Ida-West Energy, an operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. Idaho Power, headquartered in vibrant and fast-growing Boise, Idaho, has been a locally operated energy company since 1916. Today, it serves a 24,000-square-mile service area in Idaho and Oregon. Idaho Power's goal to provide 100% clean energy by 2045 builds on its long history as a clean-energy leader that provides reliable service at affordable prices. With 17 low-cost hydropower projects at the core of its diverse energy mix, Idaho Power's residential, business, and agricultural customers pay among the nation's lowest prices for electricity. Its 2,100 employees proudly serve more than 650,000 customers with a culture of safety first, integrity always, and respect for all.

El Partido Popular liderado por Feij√≥o se enfrenta a 28 procesos judiciales por corrupci√≥n con m√°s de 150 cargos implicados El PP acumula 28 juicios por corrupci√≥n bajo la direcci√≥n de Feij√≥o con implicaciones hist√≥ricas para la pol√≠tica espa√±ola Estos incluyen las macrocausas m√°s medi√°ticas como G√ºrtel, P√∫nica, Lezo, Kitchen, Erial, Novo Carthago, el Campus de la Justicia de Madrid o la desaladora de Escombreras en Murcia, as√≠ como otros procedimientos menores. En conjunto, los tribunales han puesto en evidencia la magnitud de la trama: m√°s de 150 cargos p√∫blicos del PP est√°n implicados en estos sumarios. Entre ellos figuran ex altos cargos populares como el expresidente Mariano Rajoy (implicado en la llamada Operaci√≥n Catalu√±a), el exvicepresidente Rodrigo Rato, la exministra Ana Mato, el exministro de Interior Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az, el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana y varios l√≠deres regionales, como el expresidente murciano Pedro Antonio S√°nchez o el exmandatario de Murcia Ram√≥n Luis Valc√°rcel. La cuant√≠a de las penas solicitadas es enorme: por ejemplo, la Fiscal√≠a pide d√©cadas de c√°rcel para Rato por fraudes econ√≥micos. Calendario judicial de las macrocausas pendientes El calendario judicial de estos procesos se extiende a lo largo de varios a√±os. Entre los hitos ya conocidos destacan: Caso Rato (Audiencia Provincial de Madrid): El exministro Rodrigo Rato fue juzgado entre diciembre de 2023 y mayo de 2024 por delitos fiscales (caso Bankia) y uso indebido de tarjetas (tarjetas Black). Cumpli√≥ condena por estas tarjetas y tiene pendiente un juicio por un presunto fraude en la salida a bolsa de Bankia. Caso Erial (Audiencia Provincial de Valencia): En octubre de 2024 se dict√≥ sentencia no firme contra el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana, condenado a 10 a√±os y 5 meses de prisi√≥n por blanqueo, cohecho, falsedad documental y prevaricaci√≥n en la adjudicaci√≥n de estaciones de ITV (pelotazo de las ITV). A√∫n puede recurrirse este fallo ante el Tribunal Supremo. Operaci√≥n P√∫nica (Audiencia Nacional, Madrid): La pieza principal del caso ‚Äìel supuesto ama√±o de contratos de eficiencia energ√©tica a la empresa Cofely‚Äì tiene fecha de juicio: la vista oral empezar√° el 7 de abril de 2025 y durar√° hasta mayo. Se sentar√°n 37 acusados en el banquillo, incluidos nueve exalcaldes (siete del PP) de Madrid y Extremadura, por la adjudicaci√≥n irregular de contratos municipales de m√°s de 224 millones de euros. Adem√°s de esta pieza, otras diez piezas separadas de P√∫nica siguen pendientes de juicio. Operaci√≥n Kitchen (Audiencia Nacional): El tribunal fij√≥ el juicio para mayo-junio de 2026. En este caso se enjuiciar√° a los exministros del Interior Jorge Fern√°ndez D√≠az y Francisco Mart√≠nez, as√≠ como a varios comisarios de Polic√≠a por la trama policial ilegal montada en 2013 para espiar al extesorero Luis B√°rcenas. La Fiscal√≠a solicita 15 a√±os de c√°rcel para Fern√°ndez D√≠az y Mart√≠nez. Caso Novo Carthago (Murcia): El proceso por la urbanizaci√≥n ilegal de Novo Carthago, en el que est√°n imputados exconsejeros murcianos, sufri√≥ un aplazamiento judicial. Debido a una huelga de letrados se ha pospuesto la vista oral hasta 2025. Caso Campus de la Justicia (Audiencia Nacional): En septiembre de 2024 la Audiencia Nacional conden√≥ a 7 a√±os de prisi√≥n a Alfredo Prada, exconsejero de Justicia de la Comunidad de Madrid en el Gobierno de Esperanza Aguirre, por prevaricaci√≥n y malversaci√≥n en contratos ama√±ados del proyecto del Campus Judicial. Cuatro exdirectivos del proyecto recibieron penas menores (3,5 a√±os). Caso Desaladora de Escombreras (Audiencia Provincial de Murcia): El expresidente murciano Ram√≥n Luis Valc√°rcel enfrenta en julio de 2024 una vista de conformidad que podr√≠a evitar el juicio oral. Se le investiga por presuntos delitos de malversaci√≥n, prevaricaci√≥n y fraude en la construcci√≥n y rescate de la desaladora de Escombreras. La fiscal√≠a pide 11 a√±os de c√°rcel y fuertes inhabilitaciones. La jueza instructora orden√≥ en 2023 juicio oral contra Valc√°rcel tras advertir indicios de delito. Caso G√ºrtel: Varias piezas de esta trama originada hace a√±os siguen su curso. Por ejemplo, en la pieza 5 (pelotazo Orange Market de los contratos de la Generalitat Valenciana) est√°n pendientes sentencias pr√≥ximas contra figuras como Francisco Camps. Asimismo, el Supremo debe resolver recursos contra la sentencia de la denominada caja B del PP, que conden√≥ al extesorero B√°rcenas. En la Comunidad de Madrid hay otra caja B investigada en una pieza separada del caso P√∫nica. En conjunto, quedan al menos cuatro causas G√ºrtel pendientes en distintas fases. Otros casos pendientes: El caso Lezo (gesti√≥n de Canal Isabel II) mantiene varias piezas con exconsejeros procesados, aunque a√∫n no se ha fijado fecha de juicio definitiva. Tambi√©n contin√∫an las investigaciones por las irregularidades en las cajas de ahorros (casos Caja B y Bankia) y el rescate de las autopistas radiales, con procesos judiciales abiertos donde el PP figura como responsable civil. Los magistrados Enrique L√≥pez y Concepci√≥n Espejel han sido apartados de varios tribunales debido a sus acusados v√≠nculos con el PP. Estos jueces, que llegaron a ser elegidos con el apoyo popular, hab√≠an sido recusados por la Fiscal√≠a y la acusaci√≥n popular por su ‚Äúafinidad‚Äù al partido. El caso m√°s reciente fue su relevo en el juicio de la financiaci√≥n ilegal (caja B) del PP. Este tipo de recusaciones ha alimentado cr√≠ticas de que existe una ‚Äúinstrumentalizaci√≥n de la justicia‚Äù con motivaciones pol√≠ticas. Incluso el presidente Pedro S√°nchez denunci√≥ p√∫blicamente casos de ‚Äúlawfare‚Äù (uso pol√≠tico de la justicia), citando la Operaci√≥n Kitchen como ejemplo de persecuci√≥n pol√≠tica contra el PP. Voces de la oposici√≥n recalcan que estas estrategias minan la imparcialidad y exigen garant√≠as de neutralidad en los tribunales. En conclusi√≥n, la intensa actividad judicial ha convertido al PP de Feij√≥o en la formaci√≥n pol√≠tica con m√°s procesos abiertos por corrupci√≥n en Espa√±a. Los 28 juicios por corrupci√≥n del PP previstos hasta 2029 marcar√°n la agenda pol√≠tica y judicial. El partido lo atribuye a casos del pasado anteriores a la actual direcci√≥n, mientras sus cr√≠ticos lo interpretan como la mayor constelaci√≥n de casos de corrupci√≥n en la historia reciente del pa√≠s. El tiempo y los tribunales dir√°n hasta qu√© punto estas causas consolidan o desaf√≠an la credibilidad del PP en el poder"

OG-6219 is an oral 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD17B1) inhibitor, which Organon acquired through its acquisition of Forendo Pharma in 2021. In the study, OG-6219 did not demonstrate improvement in moderate-to-severe endometriosis-related overall pelvic pain compared to placebo. Based on these results, the company plans to discontinue the OG-6219 clinical development program. ""While these study results are disappointing, Organon remains committed to our long-term vision to create a better and healthier every day for all women including those living with endometriosis,"" said Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira, M.D., Head of Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer at Organon. ""We are grateful to all the patients, caregivers, and investigators for their participation in and support of this study."" The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, global multi-center Phase 2a/b study (NCT05560646) aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of three dose levels of OG-6219 in pre-menopausal women 18 to 49 years of age who have been surgically diagnosed with endometriosis with moderate-to-severe endometriosis-related pain. Eligible patients were randomized to receive one of three doses of OG-6219 or placebo orally twice a day. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from the baseline cycle (placebo run-in cycle) to the last planned treatment cycle (third month of treatment exposure), in the mean endometriosis-related overall pelvic pain score (measured using an eleven-point numerical rating scale). About Organon Organon (NYSE: OGN) is a global healthcare company with a mission to deliver impactful medicines and solutions for a healthier every day. With a portfolio of over 70 products across Women's Health and General Medicines, which includes biosimilars, Organon focuses on addressing health needs that uniquely, disproportionately or differently affect women, while expanding access to essential treatments in over 140 markets.

OG-6219 is an oral 17Œ≤-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD17B1) inhibitor, which Organon acquired through its acquisition of Forendo Pharma in 2021. In the study, OG-6219 did not demonstrate improvement in moderate-to-severe endometriosis-related overall pelvic pain compared to placebo. Based on these results, the company plans to discontinue the OG-6219 clinical development program. ""While these study results are disappointing, Organon remains committed to our long-term vision to create a better and healthier every day for all women including those living with endometriosis,"" said Juan Camilo Arjona Ferreira, M.D., Head of Research & Development and Chief Medical Officer at Organon. ""We are grateful to all the patients, caregivers, and investigators for their participation in and support of this study."" The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, global multi-center Phase 2a/b study (NCT05560646) aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of three dose levels of OG-6219 in pre-menopausal women 18 to 49 years of age who have been surgically diagnosed with endometriosis with moderate-to-severe endometriosis-related pain. Eligible patients were randomized to receive one of three doses of OG-6219 or placebo orally twice a day. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from the baseline cycle (placebo run-in cycle) to the last planned treatment cycle (third month of treatment exposure), in the mean endometriosis-related overall pelvic pain score (measured using an eleven-point numerical rating scale). About Organon Organon (NYSE: OGN) is a global healthcare company with a mission to deliver impactful medicines and solutions for a healthier every day. With a portfolio of over 70 products across Women's Health and General Medicines, which includes biosimilars, Organon focuses on addressing health needs that uniquely, disproportionately or differently affect women, while expanding access to essential treatments in over 140 markets.

Editor's Note: This story was first published by The B. C. Catholic and is reprinted here with permission. Canadian member of Parliament (MP) from Cloverdale-Langley City in British Columbia, Tamara Jansen, has introduced a private member's bill to stop the expansion of medical assistance in dying (MAID) for mental illness alone. Jansen's Bill C-218 would amend the criminal code to prevent mental disorders from being considered a ‚Äúgrievous and irremediable medical condition‚Äù for the purposes of MAID. The bill was read a first time in the House of Commons on June 20 and is scheduled for second reading at the next sitting of the House. Speaking in the House, Jansen said: ‚ÄúImagine your son or daughter battling depression for some time, after losing a job or maybe a broken relationship. Imagine they feel the loss so deep that they're convinced the world would be better off without them.‚Äù Starting March 27, 2027, such Canadians ‚Äúcould walk into a doctor's office and ask them to end their life,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúThat's not a future scenario, that's the law right now waiting to take effect.‚Äù The Justin Trudeau government delayed expansion until 2024 and again until March 17, 2027, over concerns from medical and legal experts. ‚ÄúClinical experts have warned that there's no evidence-based way to determine if someone with a mental illness would get better, and most do,‚Äù Jansen said. ‚ÄúBut still the government is moving forward.‚Äù Jansen said the proposed law sends a message to ‚Äústruggling Canadians, trauma survivors, those battling depression, schizophrenia, PTSD‚Äù that ‚Äúdeath is a solution we're now willing to offer‚Äù in response to suffering. ‚ÄúThat's not health care. That's not compassion. It's abandonment.‚Äù She told MPs: ‚ÄúMental illness is treatable. Recovery is possible, but only if we show up and help.‚Äù Jansen's bill is similar to 2023 legislation that was narrowly defeated in Parliament but delayed implementation of the federal law. Conservative MP Ed Fast of Abbotsford, British Columbia, introduced Bill C-314, which would have stopped the expansion of Canada's euthanasia regime. It was defeated at second reading on Oct. 18, 2023, by a 167-150 vote. Fast gathered cross-party support for his legislation, with all 24 New Democratic Party (NDP) members voting in favor of his bill and eight members of the Liberal Party breaking ranks from their colleagues. The Bloc Qu√©b√©cois held the balance of power on the vote, as each of its members voted against the Abbotsford, British Columbia, representative's endeavor. During the oral question period preceding the vote, Fast condemned reports ‚Äúof Canadians crying out for help and being offered assisted suicide instead.‚Äù He attacked ‚Äúthe sorry state of our mental health system,‚Äù saying: ‚ÄúMillions of Canadians oppose the government's fascination with assisted death.‚Äù A Christian political advocacy group praised Jansen's bill and called on MPs to support it regardless of party. ‚ÄúCanada can never be ready to offer MAID for mental illness,‚Äù said Daniel Zekveld, a policy analyst with the Association for Reformed Political Action Canada. ‚ÄúDoing so would undermine suicide prevention efforts and mental health care. Canada cannot promote suicide prevention while at the same time offering suicide assistance as a solution for mental illness.‚Äù Zekveld said: ‚ÄúSince Parliament's last delay of the mental illness expansion, we've seen more stories of people who are suffering and unable to access necessary supports and care being offered MAID.‚Äù Offering euthanasia to people for mental illness implies ‚Äúthere is no hope of recovery and normalizes suicide as a solution for suffering,‚Äù Zekveld said. ‚ÄúBut psychiatrists tell us they cannot reliably diagnose mental illness as irremediable. Canadians with mental illness need hope and support, not euthanasia or assisted suicide.‚Äù Alex Schadenberg of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition said if Bill C-218 is to pass, politicians need to hear from Canadians. He is asking people to send their mental health stories and share what would have happened had MAID been available at the time. Stories can be sent to [email¬†protected]."

According to its makers, this formula blends a variety of probiotic strains‚Äîmany of which are supported by clinical studies‚Äîto promote a balanced oral microbiome and support gum and dental health. The CDC's oral health data highlights a concerning trend: around 21% of adults deal with tooth decay, and roughly 40% are affected by gum disease. Research suggests that conventional dental hygiene routines like brushing and flossing may not be enough to maintain optimal oral health. Restoring a healthy balance of bacteria in the mouth is believed to be a crucial step in preventing oral infections and inflammation. ProDentim is said to work by encouraging the growth of beneficial bacteria in the oral cavity while also supporting overall immune health. In this review, we'll take a comprehensive look at ProDentim's formulation , its intended mechanism of action, and the potential advantages it offers. Want fresher breath and stronger gums? Discover how ProDentim's probiotic formula can help We'll also explore practical details such as the product's pricing, where to purchase it, and whether any refund policies are in place. By the end of this analysis, we'll offer a clear verdict on whether ProDentim stands up to its claims and if it's a product worth considering for oral wellness. Keep reading to discover everything you need to know about ProDentim. What Exactly Is ProDentim? ProDentim is a unique oral health supplement created to support healthy teeth and gums using a natural approach. Each serving contains a blend of 3.5 billion probiotic strains along with plant-based nutrients, all selected for their clinically supported benefits in promoting a balanced oral microbiome and strengthening immune function. Produced in the United States within a facility that follows FDA regulations and adheres to GMP (Good Manufacturing Practices) standards, ProDentim is free from harsh chemicals, artificial stimulants, and gluten. It is also non-GMO and not habit-forming. This supplement is delivered in the form of soft, chewable tablets that are simple to incorporate into your daily routine. Each bottle includes 30 tablets‚Äîenough for a one-month supply. Considering a natural way to boost your oral wellness? Find out more about ProDentim's benefits and ordering options A Look at the Key Ingredients in ProDentim ProDentim combines 3.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of beneficial probiotics with a carefully selected mix of four plant-based components. Each ingredient in the formula has been researched for its potential to promote healthier gums and teeth. Below is a breakdown of what goes into this oral health supplement: Lactobacillus paracasei Naturally present in both the mouth and gut, this probiotic strain supports a balanced oral microbiome by inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria. Research indicates that it may help reduce the risk of tooth decay, calm gum inflammation, and prevent periodontal disease. B. lactis BL-04¬Æ Sourced from the large intestine, this well-documented probiotic plays a role in protecting the body against oral pathogens and enhancing immune response. It's also known for its role in digestive health and has been shown to lower the risk of respiratory infections like the common cold. Lactobacillus reuteri This probiotic is known for its powerful anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. It helps protect the mouth from infection, including gingivitis and periodontitis, and can limit the growth of bacteria responsible for cavities and gum problems. Inulin A natural prebiotic fiber, inulin supports the growth of healthy oral bacteria while also reducing halitosis (bad breath). It promotes oral microbial balance, contributes to immune health, and may reduce the chances of gum issues. Malic Acid Found in various fruits and vegetables, malic acid helps stimulate natural saliva production, especially helpful for those dealing with dry mouth. It also assists in reducing bacterial buildup and may help gently whiten teeth by preventing surface stains. Additionally, malic acid offers benefits for skin renewal and exfoliation. Tricalcium Phosphate A commonly used compound in dental supplements, tricalcium phosphate supports enamel repair and is believed to aid in tooth remineralization. It may reduce tooth sensitivity, support nerve health, and assist in controlling plaque and tartar. Peppermint This aromatic herb is well-known for its freshening and antibacterial properties. Peppermint supports oral cleanliness by helping prevent plaque accumulation and soothing gum tissue. It's also helpful in relieving dry mouth and fighting unpleasant breath.

But can these viewpoint-based refusals survive under the ""failure-to-function"" doctrine instead? Background: ¬≠¬≠¬≠¬≠Supreme Court Struck Down Bar on Registration of ""Disparaging,"" ""Immoral,"" and ""Scandalous"" Marks Eight years ago, in Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744 (2017), the United States Supreme Court struck down the Lanham Act's bar on registering trademarks that ""disparage"" persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols. The Court's decision in Tam was in response to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)'s refusal to register an Asian American band's name, ""THE SLANTS."" There, the Court held that: (1) viewpoint-based trademark restrictions are unconstitutional under the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause; and (2) the disparagement clause was viewpoint-based and, therefore, unconstitutional. Two years later, in Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388 (2019), the Supreme Court heard Erik Brunetti's challenge to a neighboring provision of the Lanham Act: the ban on registering ""immoral or scandalous"" marks. In that case, Brunetti sought to register the name of his clothing brand ""F-U-C-T."" While pronounced as four discrete letters, the government alleged that the applied-for mark was ""the equivalent of the . . . past participle form of a well-known"" obscenity. There, the Court held that the bar on registering ""immoral or scandalous"" trademarks constituted viewpoint discrimination and was, consequently, a violation of the First Amendment. The USPTO Subsequently Invoked the ""Failure-to-Function"" Doctrine as a Basis for Refusing Brunetti's Applications for ""F***"" In addition to his application for the mark ""FUCT,"" Erik Brunetti filed four intent-to-use applications for the mark ""F***"" (spelled and pronounced as the present tense form of FUCT) in connection with various consumer goods and associated retail store services. While Brunetti's application for the mark ""FUCT"" was pending before the Supreme Court in Iancu v. Brunetti, his concurrent intent-to-use applications for F*** were suspended by the examining attorney assigned to review the applications. Upon resolution of Brunetti, the USPTO examining attorney re-examined the applications and subsequently refused registration based on a conclusion that the applied-for mark ""fails to function"" as a trademark. Notably, this basis for refusal was not raised until after the Court's Brunetti decision, striking the ""immoral or scandalous"" basis of refusal as impermissibly viewpoint-based. The Examiner Found That the Applied-For Mark is ""Commonly Used"" and Thus Less Likely to be Perceived as a Source Identifier In support of the foregoing ""failure-to-function"" refusals, the examining attorney offered evidence in the form of articles and dictionary definitions, which, according to the examiner, ""illustrates that the term is commonly used as a versatile expression conveying a wide range of emotion, from disdain to joy."" See Examiner's Brief Filed with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board at p. 12, available here. The examining attorney argued that ""[b]ecause consumers are accustomed to seeing this term or expression commonly used in everyday speech by many different sources, they would not perceive the use of the term as a mark identifying the source of Applicant's goods and/or services but rather as only conveying an informational message or sentiment."" The Examiner Relied on Evidence Showing Ornamental Use of the Applied-For Mark The examiner also sought out and relied upon evidence from third-party sources such as Amazon and Etsy to show the word ""F***"" used in a decorative or ornamental fashion on several of the goods listed in Brunetti's applications, including phone cases, jewelry, wallets, and tote bags. The examiner explained such evidence ""illustrates that many competitors use the term as an informational message on jewelry, bags, phone cases, and many other items"" and that ""[t]o allow the Applicant to appropriate the term for its proposed goods and services would prevent competitors from using the commonplace term to promote their own goods and services."" The Refusal Survived Appeal The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB or Board) upheld the examiner's refusal of the marks based on a failure to function. In doing so, the Board found that the evidence of record establishes that the applied-for word ""F***"" expresses well-recognized familiar sentiments and that relevant consumers are accustomed to seeing the word in widespread use on the types of goods identified in Brunetti's applications. Accordingly, the Board concluded that the word ""F***"" does not function as a trademark distinguishing Brunetti's goods and services in commerce. Brunetti Asserted ""Failure-to-Function"" is a ""Novel"" Doctrine Used to Circumvent Bans on Viewpoint-Based Refusals In response to the Board's decision, Brunetti asserted that failure-to-function is an ""invalid"" substantive refusal lacking statutory basis. Brunetti accused the USPTO of weaponizing a procedural doctrine to ""evade the Supreme Court's decisions"" in Tam and Brunetti, thereby creating a new backdoor substantive doctrine. Under this well-established procedural doctrine, if a submitted specimen ""demonstrates merely ornamental use"" of an applied-for mark, then the USPTO can issue a refusal of the mark for failing to function as a trademark. In his briefings, Brunetti argued that the USPTO has since expanded this procedural refusal to create a ""novel, substantive doctrine"" under which some words can never be registered. He noted that ""it was not a coincidence"" that these same words ""would have been refused under Section 2(a) prior to Tam and Brunetti."" In addition to asserting that the new failure-to-function doctrine was invalid, Brunetti contended that it lacked consistent standards and contradicted ""fundamental principles of trademark law."" Brunetti alleged that the refusals of his applications were ""predetermined,"" as evidenced by the USPTO's continuous ""discovery of new grounds."" Illustrating this point, Brunetti pointed to the justifications offered by the USPTO for why ""F***"" could not be registered and explained how the evidence did not support their rationale. Brunetti submitted that all of the USPTO's evidence of ""use"" was ornamental, which cannot ""preclude a term from being perceived as a trademark."" On the contrary, Brunetti pointed to examples of other ""widely used"" words and phrases that are registered: ""LOVE,"" ""APPLE,"" and ""DELTA."" Consequently, Brunetti argued that if the USPTO's approach was correct, these words should also be unregistrable. Federal Circuit Expressed Skepticism During Oral Arguments On March 10, 2025, a panel of Federal Circuit judges heard oral arguments on behalf of Mr. Brunetti and the USPTO. During oral arguments, the court questioned how the USPTO could judge how a mark would be perceived by consumers, where, as here, the mark is not yet being used by the applicant in connection with its goods and services. Notably, in its briefing, the USPTO criticized Brunetti for failing to present evidence that consumers would perceive the word ""F***"" as a source identifier. However, when asked during oral arguments what type of evidence Brunetti was supposed to present to show consumer perception, the attorney for the USPTO failed to provide any examples. Instead, the USPTO's attorney opined that ""it would probably be difficult given the nature of this particular proposed mark in the classes for which [Brunetti] has applied for it, to demonstrate that consumers are going to understand it as, as a trademark.""

I  experienced diarrhea after the first round so my naturopathic provider prescribed me another dose! I have a problem with constipation so my goal is always to have a daily movement. My stomach is so sensitive and stubborn!! I would hit my goal every single day, no bloat and felt great until I eat something and everything goes haywire. My current symptoms is foul smelling gas, bloating and a stale odor coming from my nose and mouth. My oral hygiene is impeccable. I brush three times a day and constantly chew gum because I'm afraid of smelling bad. Thankfully I work in healthcare in the OR so most of time I'm wearing a mask. Anyone else experiencing bad breath with SIBO? I've tried everything!! Currently on a gut motility supplement, B complex and SIBO-MMC but it's not helping. I've tried magnesium citrate, chia seeds, betaine HCL etc. This has definitely destroyed any confidence I had and gave me social anxiety. I asked ChatGPT on what I can do and it recommend iberogast, a spore based probiotic and pendulum akkamansia so I'll try that next. Thanks for your input.

n12vfft,2025-07-03 05:44:36,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Quoting the full Iliad segment: *But, you, if you are able, guard your own son; go to Olympus and make prayer to Zeus, if ever you have gladdened his heart by word or deed. For often I have heard you glorying in the halls of my father, and* ***declaring that you alone among the immortals warded off shameful ruin from the son of Cronos, lord of the dark clouds, on the day when the other Olympians wished to put him in bonds****, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. But you came, goddess, and freed him from his bonds,* ***when you had quickly called to high Olympus him of the hundred hands****, whom the gods call Briareus, but all men Aegaeon; for he is mightier than his father. * ***He sat down by the side of the son of Cronos, exulting in his glory, and the blessed gods were seized with fear of him, and did not bind Zeus. *** The key language here is that they wished to put him in bonds, but did not bind him. The way it reads is that they plotted to chain him, but were stifled in their plans by the presence of Briareus. If the intention was that they successfully bound Zeus, they wouldn't write that they literally didn't bind Zeus in the same passage. The language here implies that Thetis was made aware of the plans and stopped it before it could happen, and that ""Freeing Zeus from his bonds"" is poetic language for freeing him from by foiling the plan rather than by literally untying him. Which is why they ""Wished"" to put him in bonds, why he was freed when she called Briareus up to Olympus rather than by her literally untying him, and why the blessed gods were so seized with fear that they ""Did not bind Zeus"". Like if Zeus was hogtied here, this would at least be a very weird way to word it, right? The later accounts I'm referencing come from exegetical scholarship. As in, ancient scholars who critically examined the text and added context after it was written. Most notably the works known as the b and T Scholia, which reference even older ancient works that we don't have anymore. We also get Apollo's presence through these texts, with writers in later antiquity substituting in Athena's name for Apollo. This is why modern scholarship is relevant, many of these texts are untranslated and fragmentary, and it is the job of modern scholarship to translate and make reference to them. Whether or not this was Homer's intention with the story is another discussion, but this is where we fall into the pitfall of trying to assign a ""Canon"" to a collection of mostly lost oral traditions and living myths. When does Greek mythology ""End"". How recent does a source need to be for it to be completely invalid? Only sources from during the widespread worship? Then Ovid would be valid. Only the oldest possible myths? Then we're talking Mycenaean and Minoan myths. No Roman stuff? Why not? Etc etc. Also you're missing the point of me bringing up the boast. It's not JUST that he was boasting, but that the other gods (Including the apparently equally as powerful (Citation needed) Athena) BELIEVE him. Even the ones who you say were apparently able to beat him in a fight and bind him seem to 100% believe that he could take them all in a fight, none of them challenge or question his claims, not even when he isn't in earshot. This is also consistent with the rest of the text. Outside of the one incident where he could've theoretically been bound if you interpret it in a certain way and omit the passage where it says he literally wasn't bound, there are several incidents in which other gods, including Poseidon himself, acknowledge that Zeus is stronger than they are. Also it's funny that you bring up Athena being equally strong because Athena herself is the one who confirms the truth of Zeus' boast when she speaks on behalf of the Olympians in saying that she believes him and acknowledges that he's stronger!"

The plaintiffs in these cases alleged that companies unlawfully used technologies like ‚Äúsession replay‚Äù software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The court assessed how CIPA, an older wiretapping law, applies to modern website tracking like session replay and chatbots, focusing on definitions of ‚Äúinterception‚Äù and ‚Äúcontents.‚Äù A Ninth Circuit court of appeals panel reviewed three separate proposed class actions against¬†Papa John's International Inc., Converse Inc., and Bloomingdale's, all centered on whether certain website tracking activities violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The Core Issue: CIPA and Website Communications    At the core of these cases is the application of CIPA Section 631 , a statute originally enacted to address traditional wiretapping and eavesdropping, to modern website tracking technologies. CIPA Section 631(a) imposes liability on an entity that ‚Äúintentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection . . . with any telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, or willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report or communication while the same is in transit . . . ‚Äù ¬†The same section also imposes liability on an entity that ‚Äúaids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons‚Äù to commit one or more of the aforesaid acts.‚Äù The recent surge in CIPA litigation has targeted companies employing these tracking technologies, seeking to recover statutory damages of $5,000 per violation. The Allegations: Website Tracking and the California Invasion of Privacy Act    The plaintiffs in these cases allege that companies unlawfully used technologies like ‚Äúsession replay‚Äù software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The Lower Court Decisions and the Ninth Circuit's Considerations    Papa John's: In¬† Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc. , the plaintiff alleged that Papa John's unlawfully eavesdropped and wiretapped by capturing customers' website interactions using tracking software and sent the data to a third-party. The lower court dismissed the case, determining that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege that Papa John's engaged in or aided and abetted wiretapping. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit found, ‚ÄúThomas alleged that Papa John's directly violated section 631(a) of the California Penal Code by 'eavesdrop[ping] and learn[ing] the content of its users' communications.' But a party to a conversation cannot be liable under section 631 for 'eavesdropping' on its own conversation,‚Äù the panel said. ‚ÄúThomas did not allege that Papa John's violated section 631 by aiding another party in eavesdropping.‚Äù Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that Papa John's, as a party to the communications, can't be liable for spying on its own conversation. Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc. . Bloomingdale's: ¬†In¬† Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's LLC et al. , the plaintiff alleged that Bloomingdale's used session replay code to capture and disclose the ‚Äúcontents‚Äù of website communications to a third-party vendor without user consent, violating CIPA Section 631. The district court granted the motion of Bloomingdale motion to dismiss Mikulsky's complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On appeal, Bloomingdale's argued that masking text fields prevented the vendor from viewing this data, however, the Ninth Circuit panel reversed the lower court's decision finding that the district court erred in dismissing Mikulsky's claim under CIPA section 631(a), finding that the complaint stated sufficient facts to allege that Defendants aided, agreed with, employed, or conspired with Session Replay Code providers to enable the providers to read, attempt to read, or to learn ‚Äúthe contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same [was] in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or [was] being sent from, or received at any place within this state,‚Äù without the consent of all parties. The court further found that the complaint alleged real-time capture of the contents of Mikulsky's communications on Defendants' website without her consent, not merely the real-time capture of information regarding the characteristics of the communications. Mikulsky v. Bloomingdales, LLC, et al. Converse:¬† In¬† Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al . , the claims revolved around Converse's use of online customer service chat features allowing users to interact with Converse customer service agents through text-based communication directly on its website and whether the communications through these features could be considered analogous to traditional telephone communications covered by CIPA. The district court granted Converse's motion for summary judgment finding that the internet transmissions, specifically the online chat features, were not analogous to traditional telephone communications as covered by CIPA Section 631, finding this clause applies solely to ‚Äútelephone communications‚Äù. The court also found that the chat provider did not engage in wiretapping, as the messages were encrypted in transit and password-protected on the provider's servers, preventing the ‚Äúwillful and without consent‚Äù reading of communications as required for CIPA liability. On appeal, during the Ninth Circuit's hearing of oral arguments, Judge Jay S. Bybee expressed concerns about applying a statute adopted in 1967 to modern internet technology, describing it as ‚Äúvery anachronistic‚Äù. Judge Baybee suggested that the plaintiff might be better served asserting her claims under a more recent California statute designed to protect consumers' online privacy. The court has yet to rule on the appeal. Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al . Key Takeaways: Implications for Businesses    The Ninth Circuit's decisions in¬† Thomas v. Papa John's,¬†Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's , and¬† Gutierrez v. Converse¬† represent a critical moment in the ongoing debate over how existing privacy laws, apply to modern website tracking technologies. Balancing Old Law and New Technology:¬† These cases highlight the ongoing challenge of interpreting and applying older privacy laws to rapidly evolving internet technology. The Ninth Circuit's decisions offer insight into how courts are grappling with these complexities, focusing on the technical specifics of data capture and the specific requirements of CIPA's various clauses. The Ninth Circuit's review allowed it to address key questions about applying CIPA, a law originally focused on telephone wiretapping, to modern internet communications, and what level of consent is required for tracking technologies. The appeals aimed to clarify the scope of CIPA liability for businesses¬†using tracking technologies and to guide courts on how to interpret and apply this older law in the context of rapidly evolving online privacy issues.

Here's a recap of what made headlines in Q2 of 2025: Hepatic Regulatory Approvals FDA Approves Maralixibat (Livmarli) Tablet for Alagille Syndrome, PFIC On April 14, 2025, the FDA approved a new tablet formulation of maralixibat (Livmarli) for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). ‚ÄúThe approval of LIVMARLI in tablet form provides a meaningful additional treatment option for patients with ALGS and PFIC. It allows flexibility for patients and physicians, with the liquid dosing used by the youngest patients and a convenient one-tablet per dose option for older patients,‚Äù said Peter Radovich, president and chief operating officer at Mirum. ‚ÄúWe have had tremendous success with LIVMARLI since its launch and we hope that the availability of the tablet will provide convenience that positively impacts patients' lives.‚Äù FDA Approves Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir (Mavyret) Label Expansion for Acute HCV On June 11, 2025, the FDA approved a label expansion for AbbVie's glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (Mavyret), an oral pangenotypic direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. With the decision, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir became approved for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients ‚â• 3 years of age with acute or chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. The approval was supported by data from the phase 3, multicenter, single-arm prospective M20-350 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 8-week treatment in adults with acute HCV infection. Key Pipeline Updates Pemvidutide Shows Significant MASH Effects, Weight Loss at 24 Weeks in Phase 2b IMPACT Trial On June 26, 2025, Altimmune announced the phase 2b IMPACT trial of pemvidutide in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) met its primary endpoint with statistically significant MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis in up to 59.1% of participants and fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH in up to 34.5% of participants in intent-to-treat analyses as well as weight loss of up to 6.2% at 24 weeks with no plateauing. Of note, the data make pemvidutide the first product candidate to demonstrate significant MASH effects and weight loss at 24 weeks. Hydronidone Meets Primary Endpoint in Phase 3 Hepatitis B Trial ON May 22, 2025, Gyre Therapeutics announced hydronidone met the primary endpoint for ‚â•1-stage regression in liver fibrosis compared to placebo in a pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating its efficacy and safety for the treatment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B in China. Based on these data, Gyre indicated plans to file an investigational new drug (IND) application in the third quarter of 2025. Pending IND clearance, the company will look to initiate a phase 2 trial in the US evaluating hydronidone for the treatment of MASH-associated fibrosis in the second half of 2025. Efruxifermin Shows Potential for Fibrosis Reduction in Phase 2b MASH Cirrhosis Trial Efruxifermin, a bivalent fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) analogue being developed for the treatment of MASH, failed to significantly reduce fibrosis without worsening of MASH at 36 weeks in the phase 2b SYMMETRY trial. However, further analysis revealed the 50 mg dose of efruxifermin may have possible benefit on fibrosis reduction at 96 weeks. Notably, efruxifermin also appeared to be associated with improvements in MASH-related histologic findings, noninvasive markers of liver injury and fibrosis, and markers of glucose and lipid metabolism. Semaglutide Improves Steatohepatitis, Fibrosis in Phase 3 MASH Trial Data from part 1 of the phase 3 Effect of Semaglutide in Subjects with Non-cirrhotic Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (ESSENCE) trial highlight the safety and efficacy of semaglutide for the treatment of patients with MASH and stage 2/3 fibrosis. Results showed once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg outperformed placebo for resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fibrosis and reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis. ‚ÄúThe ESSENCE data may represent key findings for patients in the treatment of MASH, which is estimated to affect about one in 20 adults in the US,‚Äù said Arun Sanyal, MD, ESSENCE lead author and director of the Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health at Virginia Commonwealth University. ‚ÄúBy treating both liver disease and its metabolic causes, semaglutide offers a promising new approach for millions of patients.‚Äù Phase 2 ELMWOOD Data for Elafibranor in PSC, with Cynthia Levy, MD Data from the phase 2 ELMWOOD study of elafibranor in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) shed light on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist's safety and tolerability in this patient population, suggesting elafibranor may be a potential treatment option for PSC, a chronic liver disease for which none currently exist. HCPLive Launches Flagship Hepatology Podcast Liver Lineup: Updates & Unfiltered Insights Q2 saw the launch of HCPLive's first hepatology podcast, Liver Lineup: Updates & Unfiltered Insights. Hosted by Drs. Nancy Reau and Kim Brown, the series dives into the cutting edge of liver disease research, clinical care, and real-world practice.

On appeal, Bloomingdale's argued that masking text fields prevented the vendor from viewing this data, however, the¬†Ninth Circuit panel reversed¬†the lower court's decision finding that the district court erred in dismissing Mikulsky's claim under CIPA section 631(a), finding that the complaint stated sufficient facts to allege that Defendants aided, agreed with, employed, or conspired with Session Replay Code providers to enable the providers to read, attempt to read, or to learn ‚Äúthe contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same [was] in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or [was] being sent from, or received at any place within this state,‚Äù without the consent of all parties.

The Core Issue: CIPA and Website Communications At the core of these cases is the application of CIPA Section 631, a statute originally enacted to address traditional wiretapping and eavesdropping, to modern website tracking technologies. CIPA Section 631(a) imposes liability on an entity that ‚Äúintentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection . . . with any telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, or willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report or communication while the same is in transit . . . ‚Äù ¬†The same section also imposes liability on an entity that ‚Äúaids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons‚Äù to commit one or more of the aforesaid acts.‚Äù The recent surge in CIPA litigation has targeted companies employing these tracking technologies, seeking to recover statutory damages of $5,000 per violation.

The lower court dismissed the case, determining that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege that Papa John's engaged in or aided and abetted wiretapping. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit found, ‚ÄúThomas alleged that Papa John's directly violated section 631(a) of the California Penal Code by 'eavesdrop[ping] and learn[ing] the content of its users' communications.' But a party to a conversation cannot be liable under section 631 for 'eavesdropping' on its own conversation,‚Äù the panel said. ‚ÄúThomas did not allege that Papa John's violated section 631 by aiding another party in eavesdropping.‚Äù Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that Papa John's, as a party to the communications, can't be liable for spying on its own conversation.

La sentencia considera probado que la red dirigida por Francisco Correa se extendi√≥ a ‚Äúcomunidades y municipios gobernados por el Partido Popular, debido a su estrecha relaci√≥n con cargos y miembros de este partido‚Äù. Entre estos municipios, la madrile√±a localidad de Arganda. La sentencia condena a todos los procesados por delitos como cohecho, fraude a la administraci√≥n p√∫blica o malversaci√≥n entre otros, al ama√±ar las adjudicaciones en la localidad en detrimento de los ciudadanos para beneficiar a la organizaci√≥n. A cambio, los pol√≠ticos implicados obten√≠an prebendas en forma de regalos, viajes y dinero en efectivo. Entre los condenados se encuentran el exalcalde del PP Gin√©s L√≥pez con 5 a√±os y 7 meses de c√°rcel, el exdiputado popular Benjam√≠n Mart√≠n Vasco con 5 a√±os y 11 meses, o miembros de la trama como el l√≠der Francisco Correa y su mano derecha, Pablo Crespo, con 8 a√±os y 10 meses de presidio. Los empresarios corruptores como Fernando Mart√≠n, expresidente del Real Madrid, tambi√©n son condenados. En su caso, 3 a√±os y 4 meses de prisi√≥n. Las condenas son relativamente bajas porque casi la totalidad de los procesados hab√≠an alcanzado un acuerdo de conformidad con la Fiscal√≠a Anticorrupci√≥n antes de que tuviera lugar la vista oral. El caso G√ºrtel arranc√≥ con las primeras detenciones ordenadas por el juez Baltasar Garz√≥n en 2009. Pasados 16 a√±os en los que las pesquisas han permitido demostrar la implicaci√≥n de la trama corrupta con administraciones del Partido Popular, a las que sobornaba a cambio de adjudicaciones, financiaci√≥n il√≠cita en la formaci√≥n conservadora, as√≠ como la existencia de una caja b en este partido y el pago en negro de parte de las obras de la sede, tan solo queda un juicio para dar por finalizada la investigaci√≥n.

The plaintiffs in these cases alleged that companies unlawfully used technologies like ‚Äúsession replay‚Äù software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The court assessed how CIPA, an older wiretapping law, applies to modern website tracking like session replay and chatbots, focusing on definitions of ‚Äúinterception‚Äù and ‚Äúcontents.‚Äù A Ninth Circuit court of appeals panel reviewed three separate proposed class actions against¬†Papa John's International Inc., Converse Inc., and Bloomingdale's, all centered on whether certain website tracking activities violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The Core Issue: CIPA and Website Communications At the core of these cases is the application of¬†CIPA Section 631, a statute originally enacted to address traditional wiretapping and eavesdropping, to modern website tracking technologies. CIPA Section 631(a)¬†imposes liability on an entity that ‚Äúintentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection . . . with any telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, or willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report or communication while the same is in transit . . . ‚Äù ¬†The same section also imposes liability on an entity that ‚Äúaids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons‚Äù to commit one or more of the aforesaid acts.‚Äù The recent surge in CIPA litigation has targeted companies employing these tracking technologies, seeking to recover statutory damages of $5,000 per violation. The Allegations: Website Tracking and the California Invasion of Privacy Act The plaintiffs in these cases allege that companies unlawfully used technologies like ‚Äúsession replay‚Äù software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The Lower Court Decisions and the Ninth Circuit's Considerations Papa John's:¬†In¬†Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc., the plaintiff alleged that Papa John's unlawfully eavesdropped and wiretapped by capturing customers' website interactions using tracking software and sent the data to a third-party. The lower court dismissed the case, determining that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege that Papa John's engaged in or aided and abetted wiretapping. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit found, ‚ÄúThomas alleged that Papa John's directly violated section 631(a) of the California Penal Code by 'eavesdrop[ping] and learn[ing] the content of its users' communications.' But a party to a conversation cannot be liable under section 631 for 'eavesdropping' on its own conversation,‚Äù the panel said. ‚ÄúThomas did not allege that Papa John's violated section 631 by aiding another party in eavesdropping.‚Äù Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that Papa John's, as a party to the communications, can't be liable for spying on its own conversation. Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc.. Bloomingdale's:¬†In¬†Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's LLC et al., the plaintiff alleged that Bloomingdale's used session replay code to capture and disclose the ‚Äúcontents‚Äù of website communications to a third-party vendor without user consent, violating CIPA Section 631. The district court granted the motion of Bloomingdale motion to dismiss Mikulsky's complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On appeal, Bloomingdale's argued that masking text fields prevented the vendor from viewing this data, however, the¬†Ninth Circuit panel reversed¬†the lower court's decision finding that the district court erred in dismissing Mikulsky's claim under CIPA section 631(a), finding that the complaint stated sufficient facts to allege that Defendants aided, agreed with, employed, or conspired with Session Replay Code providers to enable the providers to read, attempt to read, or to learn ‚Äúthe contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same [was] in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or [was] being sent from, or received at any place within this state,‚Äù without the consent of all parties. The court further found that the complaint alleged real-time capture of the contents of Mikulsky's communications on Defendants' website without her consent, not merely the real-time capture of information regarding the characteristics of the communications. Mikulsky v. Bloomingdales, LLC, et al. Converse:¬†In¬†Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al., the claims revolved around Converse's use of online customer service chat features allowing users to interact with Converse customer service agents through text-based communication directly on its website and whether the communications through these features could be considered analogous to traditional telephone communications covered by CIPA. The district court granted Converse's motion for summary judgment finding that the internet transmissions, specifically the online chat features, were not analogous to traditional telephone communications as covered by CIPA Section 631, finding this clause applies solely to ‚Äútelephone communications‚Äù. The court also found that the chat provider did not engage in wiretapping, as the messages were encrypted in transit and password-protected on the provider's servers, preventing the ‚Äúwillful and without consent‚Äù reading of communications as required for CIPA liability. On appeal, during the Ninth Circuit's hearing of oral arguments, Judge Jay S. Bybee expressed concerns about applying a statute adopted in 1967 to modern internet technology, describing it as ‚Äúvery anachronistic‚Äù. Judge Baybee suggested that the plaintiff might be better served asserting her claims under a more recent California statute designed to protect consumers' online privacy. The court has yet to rule on the appeal. Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al. Key Takeaways: Implications for Businesses The Ninth Circuit's decisions in¬†Thomas v. Papa John's,¬†Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's, and¬†Gutierrez v. Converse¬†represent a critical moment in the ongoing debate over how existing privacy laws, apply to modern website tracking technologies. Balancing Old Law and New Technology:¬†These cases highlight the ongoing challenge of interpreting and applying older privacy laws to rapidly evolving internet technology. The Ninth Circuit's decisions offer insight into how courts are grappling with these complexities, focusing on the technical specifics of data capture and the specific requirements of CIPA's various clauses. The Ninth Circuit's review¬†allowed it to address key questions about applying CIPA, a law originally focused on telephone wiretapping, to modern internet communications, and what level of consent is required for tracking technologies. The appeals aimed to clarify the scope of CIPA liability for businesses¬†using tracking technologies and to guide courts on how to interpret and apply this older law in the context of rapidly evolving online privacy issues. Political Landscape:¬†Legislation including¬†Senate Bill 690 (SB 690), if passed, would e.. ."

5BE838FE74DE54A0893D659C794F84A4,2025-07-04 05:08:30,en,PRINT,"‚Äâ Pune: A man, posing as a courier   delivery agent, entered a 22-year-old data scientist's 11th floor rented flat in a residential society in Kondhwa on Wednesday   evening, sprayed some chemical on her face and allegedly   raped her. ‚Ç¨≈ìHe also used the woman's cellphone to click a selfie with her, cropped his image and keyed   in a message threatening her that he would upload the photograph on social media if she disclosed the incident to anyone,ÔøΩ‚Ç¨ deputy commissioner   of police (Zone IV) Rajkumar   Shinde told TOI on Thursday. ‚Ç¨≈ìWe have seen the cropped selfie and the message on the survivor's phone after collecting   the gadget,ÔøΩ‚Ç¨ he said. The woman, who has a BE degree in data science, works with an IT firm in Kalyaninagar   and has been staying with her brother (20) in the rented flat since 2022, an office-bearer of the society told TOI . The woman and her brother are from Akola. They shifted to Pune a few years ago for employment. Her brother had gone to Akola, and she was alone at home when the ÔøΩ‚Ç¨≈ìdelivery agentÔøΩ‚Ç¨ came calling, police said. DCP Shinde said: ÔøΩ‚Ç¨≈ìThe woman   said in her complaint that she responded to the doorbell around 7.15pm and found a man, who claimed to be from a courier firm, waiting. The man told her that he needs to deliver a parcel from a bank. He asked her to acknowledge receipt of the parcel by signing on a delivery sheet he was carrying,   and told her that he had forgotten his pen. When the woman went in to bring the pen, the man seized the moment   to step in and bolted the door from inside before spraying   the chemical on her face. ‚Ç¨  The housing society in Kondhwa, where a data   scientist was allegedly raped by a man posing as a delivery agent, is made up of a single 11-storey building divided into 'A', 'B' and 'C' wings. It has a single entrance gate with a security cabin having two guards each in the morning and night shifts and also has an app for community and safety management of the residents. DCP (Zone IV) Rajkumar Shinde said: ÔøΩ‚Ç¨≈ìThe woman regained consciousness around 8.30pm and sensed something wrong was done to her. She alerted her relatives, who, in turn, informed the police. She has been admitted to a govt hospital for medical examination. Our forensic experts will examine what kind of chemical substance the intruder   used to spray on her face. For now, 10 teams have been deployed to arrest the culprit. ‚Ç¨ Experts visited the crime scene and collected forensic evidence. A spot panchnama was drawn. A dog squad was pressed into service, but it did not pick up the trail of the culprit, police said. ‚Ç¨≈ìWe have identified 10 delivery agents from courier and e-commerce firms and food delivery services, who visited the society on Wednesday and are verifying them,ÔøΩ‚Ç¨ said an officer, who is part of the probe. The police have registered a case relating to offences punishable under sections   64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism) and 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar told TOI : ÔøΩ‚Ç¨≈ìWe have collected the survivor's oral and nasal swab to establish the chemical substance   alleged to have been used to render the survivor   unconscious. We have roped in all our re sources considering the nature of the crime. ‚Ç¨ Preliminary investigation revealed that the intruder did not make an entry in the visitors' register   maintained by the society. ‚Ç¨≈ìWe are questioning   the society residents and security guards and also pursuing technical leads to identify, trace and nab the culprit,ÔøΩ‚Ç¨ additional commissioner of police   (Crime) Pankaj Deshmukh said. The guards on duty have so far maintained that there was no entry or exit of any person around the time of the incident nor any outsider has been spotted in CCTV covering the passage leading to the 'A' wing where the survivor stays. A society office bearer told TOI at the site: ÔøΩ‚Ç¨≈ìThe brother-sister duo share a cordial relationship   with all our members and have been paying their rent on time to the flat owner, who lives in Mumbai. The society is covered by two CCTV cameras. The 'A' wing, where the incident occurred,   has CCTV cameras covering the passage, parts of the other wings and the parking area. ‚Ç¨ He said: ÔøΩ‚Ç¨≈ìWe have installed a mobile application,   a visitor management facility, to regulate entry   on the society premises. Each member and tenant of the society has this application on their mobiles. We studied all the entries and exits on the application and realised that no delivery persons ÔøΩ‚Ç¨‚Äù like food delivery, quick commerce or e-commerce   ÔøΩ‚Ç¨‚Äù entered the society when the incident occurred. We have provided all details of the application   and CCTV footage to the police. ‚Ç¨ The office-bearer added: ÔøΩ‚Ç¨≈ìOnly one thing could have happened. A delivery person, who has four or five deliveries to make in different flats, could have entered the society and then might have gone to the woman's flat. ‚Ç¨"

Die Oral-B iO Series 3N und OClean X Ultra S bekommen f√ºr Handhabung, Ausstattung und Haltbarkeit jeweils gute Noten. Die Modelle liegen in derselben Preiskategorie, allerdings unterscheiden sie sich in ihren Funktionen. Eine elektrische Zahnb√ºrste reinigt die Z√§hne gr√ºndlicher als eine Handzahnb√ºrste. Der schnell rotierende Zahnb√ºrstenkopf entfernt Plaque auch an schwer erreichbaren Stellen. Zudem helfen integrierte Zeitmesser und Drucksensoren dabei, die empfohlene Putzdauer einzuhalten und Zahnfleischsch√§den zu vermeiden. Inzwischen ist die Auswahl an elektrischen Zahnb√ºrsten gro√ü ‚Äì bekannte Marken bekommen dabei immer mehr Konkurrenz. Das zeigen auch Produkttests: Stiftung Warentest und IMTEST haben elektrische Zahnb√ºrsten untersucht und kommen dabei auf unterschiedliche Ergebnisse. W√§hrend Stiftung Warentest den ersten Platz an die Oral-B iO Series 3N vergibt, sieht IMTEST die OClean X Ultra S vorn. Wir haben die beiden Testsieger verglichen und erkl√§ren, welche elektrische Zahnb√ºrste f√ºr wen besser geeignet ist. Die besten elektrischen Zahnb√ºrsten: Die Testsieger im Vergleich Stiftung Warentest und IMTEST setzen √§hnliche Schwerpunkte bei der Bewertung elektrischer Zahnb√ºrsten. Den gr√∂√üten Anteil an der Gesamtnote hatte jeweils die Reinigungsleistung. Die Testteams untersuchten, wie gut die unterschiedlichen Modelle Zahnbelag entfernen. W√§hrend Stiftung Warentest dies nach eigenen Angaben √ºber 30 Probanden √ºberpr√ºfte, nutzten die Tester von IMTEST ein k√ºnstliches Zahnmodell. Dabei imitierte eine angetrocknete Paste den Zahnbelag. Zus√§tzlich mussten sich die Zahnb√ºrsten in folgenden Kategorien bew√§hren: Handhabung, darunter die Bedienung und Funktionen wie Timer und Andruckkontrollen Ausstattung, etwa Reiseetui, Ersatzzahnb√ºrsten und App-Konnektivit√§t Haltbarkeit der Zahnb√ºrsten, getestet anhand der Wasserfestigkeit (IMTEST) und der Robustheit bei St√ºrzen (Stiftung Warentest) Umwelt- und Serviceeigenschaften wie die Akku-Laufzeit und Kosten f√ºr Ersatzzahnb√ºrsten Obwohl die Kriterien beim Test der Zahnb√ºrsten gleich waren, gehen die Testurteile auseinander: Die Oral-B iO Series 3N √ºberzeugte Stiftung Warentest am meisten, IMTEST ermittelte die OClean X Ultra S als beste elektrische Zahnb√ºrste. Letztere konnte im Test sogar die beliebte Philips Sonicare Diamond Clean hinter sich lassen. Im direkten Vergleich der beiden Testsieger zeigen sich ihre jeweiligen St√§rken und Schw√§chen: Oral-B iO Series 3N setzt sich bei Stiftung Warentest als Testsieger durch Im Test von Stiftung Warentest hat sich die Oral-B iO Series 3N unter 13 Modellen durchgesetzt und erh√§lt die Gesamtnote 1,9 (‚ÄûGut‚Äú). Bei der Zahnreinigung erzielt die Oral-B mit einer Note von 1,7 die beste Leistung. Auch in puncto Haltbarkeit und Handhabung kann das Modell √ºberzeugen. Die Oral-B iO Series 3N* ist eine elektrische Zahnb√ºrste mit einem magnetischen Antriebssystem. Dieses √ºbertr√§gt Energie direkt an die Borstenspitzen, wodurch sanfte Mikrovibrationen entstehen. Zus√§tzlich erm√∂glichen oszillierende und rotierende Bewegungen eine gr√ºndliche Zahnreinigung. Anwender k√∂nnen zwischen drei Reinigungsmodi w√§hlen: ‚ÄûT√§gliche Reinigung‚Äú, ‚ÄûSensitiv‚Äú und ‚ÄûAufhellen‚Äú. Ein integrierter Drucksensor zum Schutz des Zahnfleisches warnt mit rotem Licht bei zu starkem Druck und zeigt mit gr√ºnem Licht den optimalen Druck an. Alle 30 Sekunden erinnert ein Zeitmesser an den Wechsel des Putzbereiches und signalisiert nach zwei Minuten das Ende der empfohlenen Zahnputzzeit. Gelbes Licht zeigt an, wann der B√ºrstenkopf gewechselt werden sollte. Die Betriebslaufzeit nach einer Akkuladung betr√§gt 72 Minuten, was bei zweimal t√§glich Z√§hneputzen 18 Tagen entspricht. Im Lieferumfang enthalten sind das Handst√ºck, eine Ladestation, ein Aufsteckb√ºrstenhalter und eine Aufsteckb√ºrste. Anzeige Elektrische Zahnb√ºrste Oral-B iO Series 3N IMTEST: Elektrische Zahnb√ºrste von OClean X Ultra S belegt den ersten Platz Im Test von IMTEST konnte sich die OClean X Ultra S* als Testsieger unter f√ºnf elektrischen Zahnb√ºrsten behaupten und erh√§lt die Gesamtnote 2,44 (‚ÄûGut‚Äú). Die Tester loben die gute Reinigungsleistung: Die Zahnb√ºrste entfernte fast den gesamten simulierten Zahnbelag. Lediglich in den Zahnzwischenr√§umen und auf den Kaufl√§chen der Backenz√§hne seien minimale R√ºckst√§nde geblieben, berichtet IMTEST. Pluspunkte gab es zudem f√ºr die integrierte Andruckkontrolle und die umfangreiche Ausstattung. Die Oclean X Ultra S reinigt die Z√§hne mit rotierend-oszillierenden Bewegungen und verf√ºgt √ºber einen Touchscreen-Bildschirm mit Farben, der Informationen wie Putzdauer und Druck anzeigt. Zus√§tzlich bietet die zugeh√∂rige App detaillierte Analysen des Putzverhaltens, einschlie√ülich 3D-Darstellungen der gereinigten Bereiche und n√ºtzlichen Tipps. Zudem gibt die App an, wann der B√ºrstenkopf gewechselt werden muss. Dank der sechs Reinigungsmodi l√§sst sich die Putzroutine auf pers√∂nliche Bed√ºrfnisse abstimmen...."

n1aii43,2025-07-04 11:50:27,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ >Some religions are based off of true story or true interactions. I challenge this core assumption, which is an expression of euhemerism. In my article (published last week in *Folk Life: Journal of Ethnological Studies*), [""The Treacherous Waters of Lyonesse: Seeking Truths based on Oral Tradition,""](https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/VSNWBXX7RP4SVSTRDPKF/full?target=10.1080/04308778.2025.2522002#abstract) I take on euhemerism. Beneath this is a modern folk belief that ""all legends are based on some truth."" In my work, I dismantle an attempt by famed geomythologist Patrick Nunn to ""find the truth"" behind the legend of Lyonesse, the mythic sunken land off the southwest coast of Britain. An excerpt from my article: >Nunn participates in an approach launched by Dorothy B. Vitaliano (1916-2008). In 1968, she described coming upon the ancient Greek writer Euheremus and, with that inspiration, how she coined the term 'geomythology'. Vitaliano subsequently made a career of suggesting that classical myths and more recent folk narratives can be seen as memories of ancient events. Nunn represents a younger generation's take on Vitaliano's work, producing many books and articles as he explores oral tradition with the perspective of a geographer and geologist. As an academic method, geomythology has not fully addressed the challenges that occur when embracing euhemerism. >Three quarters of a century ago, *Funk & Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore Mythology and Legend* declared that euhemerism, 'the theory that myths are simply explanations of historical events ‚Ä¶ has been discarded as a fully explanatory method, but it is still utilized to some extent'. This public declaration and the benchmark in scholarship that it represents was not arrived at lightly. While nineteenth century folklorists often looked for a truth embedded in classical myths and more recent oral narratives, that line of enquiry rarely rose above the level of unproveable speculation. Nevertheless, that realization has apparently not influenced geomythologists. >Part of the challenge folklorists face is that euhemerism remains an intuitively popular concept among twenty-first century enthusiasts. Geomythologists provide just the sort of explanation many seek. Modern folk belief often embraces the maxim that 'all legends are based on some truth, no matter how minor or obscure'. Folklorists of all people should understand how difficult it is to shout into a wind that draws strength from folklore. >Of course, Funk & Wagnalls left the door ajar with the acknowledgement that euhemerism 'is still utilized to some extent'. There need not be a categorical condemnation of geomythology, but a correction, or at least nuance, is warranted. Although folklorists do not typically quest for the truth behind a legend, some oral narratives may in fact be true in some sense. Despite those concessions, the topic of Lyonesse is perhaps one of the least favorable for the investigations of the geomythologist. With the door left ajar, there is the *possibility* of finding a truth behind a Greek myth, but efforts to find these sorts of things too often involve absurd forms of reverse engineering, speculation then passed off as fact. The speculator then proudly announces finding ""The Truth"" behind the myth and his celebrated for the accomplishment. Even when nothing has been accomplished. All that having been said, the jar is left open for careful, considered research. Perhaps someone has a defensible example of a truth lurking behind a Greek Myth."

The plaintiffs in these cases alleged that companies unlawfully used technologies like ‚Äúsession replay‚Äù software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The court assessed how CIPA, an older wiretapping law, applies to modern website tracking like session replay and chatbots, focusing on definitions of ‚Äúinterception‚Äù and ‚Äúcontents.‚Äù A Ninth Circuit court of appeals panel reviewed three separate proposed class actions against Papa John's International Inc., Converse Inc., and Bloomingdale's, all centered on whether certain website tracking activities violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). At the core of these cases is the application of CIPA Section 631, a statute originally enacted to address traditional wiretapping and eavesdropping, to modern website tracking technologies. CIPA Section 631(a) imposes liability on an entity that ‚Äúintentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection . . . with any telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, or willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report or communication while the same is in transit . . . ‚Äù The same section also imposes liability on an entity that ‚Äúaids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons‚Äù to commit one or more of the aforesaid acts.‚Äù The recent surge in CIPA litigation has targeted companies employing these tracking technologies, seeking to recover statutory damages of $5,000 per violation. The Allegations: Website Tracking and the California Invasion of Privacy Act The plaintiffs in these cases allege that companies unlawfully used technologies like ‚Äúsession replay‚Äù software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The Lower Court Decisions and the Ninth Circuit's Considerations Papa John's: In Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc., the plaintiff alleged that Papa John's unlawfully eavesdropped and wiretapped by capturing customers' website interactions using tracking software and sent the data to a third-party. The lower court dismissed the case, determining that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege that Papa John's engaged in or aided and abetted wiretapping. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit found, ‚ÄúThomas alleged that Papa John's directly violated section 631(a) of the California Penal Code by 'eavesdrop[ping] and learn[ing] the content of its users' communications.' But a party to a conversation cannot be liable under section 631 for 'eavesdropping' on its own conversation,‚Äù the panel said. ‚ÄúThomas did not allege that Papa John's violated section 631 by aiding another party in eavesdropping.‚Äù Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that Papa John's, as a party to the communications, can't be liable for spying on its own conversation. Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc.. Bloomingdale's: In Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's LLC et al., the plaintiff alleged that Bloomingdale's used session replay code to capture and disclose the ‚Äúcontents‚Äù of website communications to a third-party vendor without user consent, violating CIPA Section 631. The district court granted the motion of Bloomingdale motion to dismiss Mikulsky's complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On appeal, Bloomingdale's argued that masking text fields prevented the vendor from viewing this data, however, the Ninth Circuit panel reversed the lower court's decision finding that the district court erred in dismissing Mikulsky's claim under CIPA section 631(a), finding that the complaint stated sufficient facts to allege that Defendants aided, agreed with, employed, or conspired with Session Replay Code providers to enable the providers to read, attempt to read, or to learn ‚Äúthe contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same [was] in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or [was] being sent from, or received at any place within this state,‚Äù without the consent of all parties. The court further found that the complaint alleged real-time capture of the contents of Mikulsky's communications on Defendants' website without her consent, not merely the real-time capture of information regarding the characteristics of the communications. Mikulsky v. Bloomingdales, LLC, et al. Converse: In Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al., the claims revolved around Converse's use of online customer service chat features allowing users to interact with Converse customer service agents through text-based communication directly on its website and whether the communications through these features could be considered analogous to traditional telephone communications covered by CIPA. The district court granted Converse's motion for summary judgment finding that the internet transmissions, specifically the online chat features, were not analogous to traditional telephone communications as covered by CIPA Section 631, finding this clause applies solely to ‚Äútelephone communications‚Äù. The court also found that the chat provider did not engage in wiretapping, as the messages were encrypted in transit and password-protected on the provider's servers, preventing the ‚Äúwillful and without consent‚Äù reading of communications as required for CIPA liability. On appeal, during the Ninth Circuit's hearing of oral arguments, Judge Jay S. Bybee expressed concerns about applying a statute adopted in 1967 to modern internet technology, describing it as ‚Äúvery anachronistic‚Äù. Judge Baybee suggested that the plaintiff might be better served asserting her claims under a more recent California statute designed to protect consumers' online privacy. The court has yet to rule on the appeal. Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al. Key Takeaways: Implications for Businesses The Ninth Circuit's decisions in Thomas v. Papa John's, Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's, and Gutierrez v. Converse represent a critical moment in the ongoing debate over how existing privacy laws, apply to modern website tracking technologies. Balancing Old Law and New Technology: These cases highlight the ongoing challenge of interpreting and applying older privacy laws to rapidly evolving internet technology. The Ninth Circuit's decisions offer insight into how courts are grappling with these complexities, focusing on the technical specifics of data capture and the specific requirements of CIPA's various clauses. The Ninth Circuit's review allowed it to address key questions about applying CIPA, a law originally focused on telephone wiretapping, to modern internet communications, and what level of consent is required for tracking technologies. The appeals aimed to clarify the scope of CIPA liability for businesses using tracking technologies and to guide courts on how to interpret and apply this older law in the context of rapidly evolving online privacy issues. Political Landscape: Legislation including Senate Bill 690 (SB 690), if passed, would exempt companies using tracking for legitimate b.. ."
668c52792590814cab983fc99902b859,2025-07-04 14:35:00,en,WEB,"‚Äâ The book Mrs Fitzherbert and Sons is a meticulously researched and deeply human portrait of Maria Fitzherbert , the secret and morganatic wife of George, Prince of Wales (later King George IV ), and the hidden lineage connected to their relationship. Drawing on family records, letters, and historical archives, Philippa and James Foord-Kelcey ‚Äî descendants of Maria's extended family ‚Äî explore the life of a woman at the centre of one of the most controversial royal romances in British history. Although their marriage was invalid under the Royal Marriages Act of 1772 ‚Äî due to her being Catholic and the union lacking the King's consent ‚Äî it was nonetheless a sacramental bond in the eyes of both parties recognised by the Pope Pius VII , solemnized before God and with deep mutual affection. They raised a family under the pseudonym's Randolph and Ann Jayne Payne at Sulby Hall in Welford The book also delves into the lives of the ""sons"" ‚Äî those who, while never publicly acknowledged as the biological children of the Prince and Mrs Fitzherbert, were closely associated with her and rumoured by some to be connected by blood. The authors trace these family lines with discretion and insight, presenting the case for a quiet legacy of royal descent outside the official line of succession. What emerges is a poignant narrative of loyalty, sacrifice, and hidden nobility , painting Mrs Fitzherbert not as a scandalous mistress, but as a woman of conscience, dignity, and profound devotion ‚Äî a loyal subject of the Crown and, arguably, the uncrowned Queen of George's heart. King George IV has often been unfairly slandered by history as a reckless gambler and a profligate spender who squandered the nation's wealth on frivolities. Yet recent research and family accounts reveal a far more nuanced picture. Behind the scenes, George was secretly setting aside funds for his children, carefully safeguarding their future through discreet deposits in Coutts Bank. This act of quiet responsibility contradicts the popular caricature of a spendthrift monarch and instead shows a father deeply concerned for the welfare and security of his offspring, despite the scandals and pressures that surrounded his reign. Far from wasting money thoughtlessly, George IV's hidden generosity reflects a side of the man rarely acknowledged in the public record ‚Äî one of love, foresight, and paternal care. The book goes into more detail about their sons Randolph and his sons and George Payne the youngest son. They had six children together Julia b.1786 d.1832, William b. 1787 d.1862, Randolph b.1790 d.1862, John b.1795 d.1875, Mary Georgina Emma b.1798 d.1848 and George b.1803 d.1878. Some also claim that that the Mrs Fitzherbert's niece Mary Ann or Marianne b.1807 ‚Äî who she reared as her own daughter ‚Äî was in reality her own child rather than the child of her brother John Smythe. If so then she must have been born around 1801 not 1807. One of these Payne sons was William Payne b.1787 was the grandfather of the West family originally from Welford on the border of Northamptonshire and Leicestershire. The West family's journey from England to Australia reflects a fascinating intertwining of loyalty, adventure, and resilience. Settling initially in Corowa and Parkes, New South Wales, the family's passion for horse racing endured across continents ‚Äî Simeon Levi West famously brought his horse Tradition to compete in the 1888 Melbourne Cup. The family's enthusiasm for racing had deep roots in England; Vincent Payne West, one of the brothers, even lost his job for attending the Newmarket races. Vincent later emigrated to Australia in search of his grandfather, William Payne, who was believed to be living in New South Wales. In fact their grandfather was in Tasmania and it was their uncle William Payne b.1804 (who married Mary Muldoon in Tasmania), the son of William Payne b.1787 that was in NSW, but he had already died by the time the West's arrived. William's life, however, was marked by complexity and controversy. According to Jim and Philippa Foord-Kelcey in Mrs Fitzherbert and Sons , William served as a soldier in the Napoleonic Wars before turning to highway robbery, for which he was convicted and reportedly transported to Australia as a convict, according to some family stories. Some family correspondence suggests William might have been sent as a remittance man under George IV's patronage, while other records place him in Tasmania, where he secondly married Ann Maria Spencer. His son William married Mary Muldoon, a Catholic, and raised a family. By marrying and raising Catholic children, William's line was effectively distanced from posing any threat to the Royal family's succession. The Payne family continued to establish roots in New South Wales, with descendants maintaining their heritage amidst the challenges of exile and reinvention. This layered history reveals how loyalty, stigma, and survival intersected in the lives of those connected ‚Äî directly or indirectly ‚Äî to the royal circle, reflecting the broader tensions between crown, faith, and identity in the 19th century. William may have remained in Tasmania , where records show a William Payne who died in 1862 at Oatlands , having fathered a son, James Spencer Payne , with Ann Maria Spencer in 1820. James died in 1886 , also at Oatlands. These details, while fragmentary, hint at a hidden lineage quietly woven into the fabric of the colonies. In this, we glimpse a story of discreet displacement: a life once touched by monarchy, now lived in distant lands under new names, carrying with it the memory of loyalty, scandal, and forgotten legitimacy . The story of William Payne offers a tantalizing and deeply human thread in the shadowed tapestry of royal and colonial history. Born in 1787 at Clapham House, Litlington , he was believed by family tradition to be the eldest son of George IV and Maria Fitzherbert , born out of their secret sacramental union. He grew up at Sulby Hall at Welford with his siblings and the children of George Pearce Payne, said to be a relative of Admiral Jack Payne a close friend of George, when he was Prince of Wales. As a young man, William is said to have secretly married Elizabeth Clarke (the daughter of John Clarke and Caroline Ann Vann) , who bore him a daughter, Mary Ann as well as a son John Payne . In a dramatic family episode, William's guardian ‚Äî known as Mr. Payne ‚Äî took the blame for the affair and was killed in a duel by Miss Clarke's brother. Mary Ann was then taken in by the Paine family of Great Houghton, Northamptonshire , and is said to have spent time with her grandmother, Maria Fitzherbert , during her youth. Later, William served as a soldier in the Napoleonic Wars , but upon returning, disillusioned and restless, he allegedly became a highwayman . According to oral tradition, it was George IV himself who arranged for William to be sent to Tasmania ‚Äî either as a form of exile or remittance. There, in Tasmania, is where his illegitimate son William (by Miss Crofts of Sulby) married Mary Muldoon , a Catholic, and eventually settled in New South Wales , where he worked as both a soldier and an innkeeper until his death in 1840 at Goulburn at the age of 36 . By raising his family as Catholics, any potential claim to royal recognition was quietly erased. Though rarely acknowledged in official records, William Payne's life reflects the complexity of hidden legitimacy , royal discretion, and colonial reinvention ‚Äî a story of both scandal and sacrifice, lived far from court, yet always beneath its shadow. Thus William Payne had his first son by Miss Crofts when he was 17. By his first secret wife Elizabeth Clarke he..."

If you make a purchase via links on this page we will earn commission - learn more With the news now out that Amazon Prime Day is set to last twice as long this year, Prime members can expect to see deals for four whole days - from the 8th to the 11th July. That's not the only huge change to this year's sale though, as Amazon has announced it will be introducing 'Today's Big Deals'. This new event will feature 'daily themes' around shopper favourites such as home and tech, with deals that have been exclusively curated for Amazon Prime members. Prime members will also see time-limited deals, which Amazon is calling 'New Deal Drops'. These timed deals will launch every day at midnight BST throughout the week. What could this mean for you? If you're currently a Prime member gearing up for the sales, you could some better-than-usual deals¬†on selected big brand products in home, tech, beauty, parenting and more. Of course,¬†Amazon hasn't officially told members what this will entail but we expect this to work similar to the classic lightning deals we're used to seeing at these events. Why Amazon has chosen to extend its Prime Day sale isn't entirely clear, with the retail giant simply saying two days 'wasn't long enough'. However, with more and more retailers launching their own summer sales¬†around Prime Day - many of which last a week or more - Amazon could be looking to compete with its biggest rivals. Amazon Prime Day¬†is now in its tenth year, with the first deals event launching in July 2015. Since then, Amazon has introduced a second Prime Day event, which runs for two days in October and a Spring Sale that takes place earlier in the year around March. Is Prime Day still worth it? With Amazon now running three exclusive deals events throughout the year on top of its Black Friday sale, enthusiasm for spending is drying up. Add to that a growing number of retailers such as John Lewis, Argos and Ninja all holding their own summer sales and its easy to see why Amazon is trying to come up with bigger and better ways to grab consumers attentions. Despite this, there are still some good Amazon Prime deals¬†to had and we expect the new addition of 'Today's Big Deals' will bring with it some exclusive discounts."

Apparently, some 15-20 years ago someone started a root canal on my #19, broke an instrument inside, never finished the canal, just put a filling on top. This story was revealed to me after x-rays performed by a different dentist 10 years ago, I was shown dark area around the root and told that this tooth can be problematic. However, it never bothered me until recently. Went to a random dentist with some pain and was given a referral to the ‚Äúendodontist A‚Äù. The ‚Äúendodontist A‚Äù could not see me until next month, so I looked at Google reviews (mistake) and went to the ‚Äúendodontist B‚Äù. The ‚Äúendodontist B‚Äù removed the broken instrument and told me that the canals are either calcified or filled with some very hard material by the dentist who worked on that tooth many years ago and that it would take multiple visits to handle them. After some digging during my second visit, she told me the tooth has a fracture and has to be pulled. Honestly, there was a teeny-tiny line visible on one side of the tooth before the endodontic work, but I suspect the ‚Äúendodontist B‚Äù just fractured my tooth with all the manipulations. She put a temporary filling, but I asked to make a more permanent one because I was about to travel. The tooth wasn't happy after this ordeal but calmed down after 10 days on antibiotics and has been doing okay for the last week or so. Now I am out of at least $1000 and wondering what my options are: Should I consult the ‚Äúendodontist A‚Äù for a second opinion? Should I go straight to the oral surgeon? Can this wait a couple of months? Here are post-appointment notes from the ‚Äúendodontist B‚Äù: The clinical and radiographic evaluation revealed symptomatic apical periodontitis in a previously initiated tooth #19. The dis-articulated instrument from the previous attempted treatment of this tooth was removed. The patient returned to my office to complete the root canal treatment. After access opening, a large fracture was seen in the mesial wall of the tooth extending deep into the root. The patient was informed that the prognosis for the tooth is poor and given a referral to an oral surgeon to get the tooth removed.

At least familiarsize yourself with the different types of dyslexia. It's taken me over a half hour to type this up. Arrrrgggghhh. Someone once asked me what I would like to ask God. I would like to see how he created the universe. MULTIPLE CHOICE QUESTION: Which of the following examples are even close to the scientific explanation of the universe? (Copy and paste from Google.) a brief overview: A. Ancient Greek: Chaos precedes the gods, with Gaia (Earth) and Uranus (Sky) as foundational figures. B. Hebrew (Genesis): God creates the heavens and earth in six days, culminating in the creation of humans. C. Norse: Fire and ice clash in a void, giving rise to the giant Ymir, from whose body the world is made. D. Chinese: Pangu separates yin and yang from chaos, creating the universe. E. Hindu: The Purusha sacrifice leads to the creation of the world and castes. Iroquois: Sky Woman falls from the sky onto a turtle's back, forming the earth [Image: sky woman iroquois creation story OR F. ""Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything"" being the number 42, calculated by a supercomputer. (Trick question) Answer B. God created evolution.

[c] 11 But you say that if anyone declares that what might have been used to help their father or mother is Corban (that is, devoted to God)‚Äî 12 then you no longer let them do anything for their father or mother. 13 Thus you nullify the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many things like that. . 2) . The story of Jesus and the woman taken in adultery (the ""Pericope Adulterae,"" John 7:53‚Äì8:11) was not part of the earliest manuscripts of the Gospel of John. Scholarly consensus holds that this passage is a later interpolation‚Äîit was added after the earliest known copies of John were written. Most scholars believe the story was circulating in oral tradition and was eventually inserted into some manuscripts, likely as a marginal note that later became part of the text. The passage first appears in some manuscripts by the 4th century and became generally accepted in the 5th century. The story was added to the New Testament between the 4th and 5th centuries, rather than being part of the original Gospel of John...do your research, check it out. . And 3) The Torah contains verses that emphasize the lasting and eternal nature of its commandments and statutes. Many passages state that certain laws are to be observed as a ""perpetual covenant"" or ""forever"" by the Israelites and their descendants. For example,¬†Exodus 12:24 states: ""And you are to keep this command as a permanent statute for you and your descendants,"" according to Exodus 12:24. Similarly, Exodus 31:16-17 declares: ""The Israelites shall observe the Sabbath...as a perpetual covenant. It is a sign forever between Me and the children of Israel"". . . HOW LONG IS FOREVER? LOL"

It would seem that it's always a fight and back and forth between conservative and liberal, Democrat and Republican, right vs. left, this religious denomination vs. that religious denomination back and forth, my way or the highway. It would seem that this fight has become a ‚Äúgood vs. bad‚Äù type thing. It would seem that there are folks whom some of us respected, admired, and dare I say loved, who have shown themselves to be far different from what our perceptions of them have been. Sometimes I just wanna scream STOP It! Other times it's a quiet ‚ÄúWhy can't we all just get along?‚Äù More recently, my thoughts have been more like, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is wrong with you?‚Äù I find it exhausting, this push and pull and continuous descension, and I find myself wondering, ‚ÄúWhat if? Why? How can we stop this madness?‚Äù Well, Imma tell ya. We can't. We simply can't stop folks from doing what they're gonna do and being who they've shown to us they actually are. But, as he so often did, Jesus gives us a bit of direction that we can apply here. In the Gospel reading appointed for today,   (Luke 10:1-12, 17-20, often called ‚ÄúThe Great Commission,‚Äù)  Jesus is telling the twelve disciples what's up, just how they're supposed to proceed with the actually being disciples thing, and what they can expect. And in the middle of this oral handbook he's delivering, he includes this little zinger:  ‚ÄúWhoever will not receive you or listen to your words‚Äîgo outside that house or town and shake the dust from your feet.‚Äù To put a more modern spin on it, in the film ‚ÄúFrozen,‚Äù Elsa sings, ‚ÄúLet It Go.‚Äù And that's a hard thing to do and it goes against everything that those of us who are/were educators believe. We try desperately to never, ever, give up on our students. We find new and different ways to try to reach them. And sometimes, we find new and different people (specialists) who have a better chance at getting whatever point across to some of these kids. But sometimes, sometimes there are students/kids/folks who are just never gonna get it. Never. And that hurts. But we persevere and keep working with the next batch of folks who are given to us to try to reach. It's what we do. And going right along with that, it's the same with those of us who preach and teach love continually. Some folks are never gonna get it. Some folks just refuse to be reached. And that's heartbreaking. Even Jesus had to learn this lesson the hard way. In Luke 19:41-44, Jesus wept over Jerusalem as He approached the city, knowing that its inhabitants would soon reject Him and face destruction. His weeping highlights Jesus's sorrow for the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart that would lead to their downfall. It also reveals His deep love and concern for the people of Jerusalem, despite their rejection of Him. Ugh. But Jesus kept right on doing what he was doing, and so do we. But I'm gonna let ya in on a little secret. Sometimes, no, actually ALL the time whilst I'm talking about this love stuff that Jesus was so adamant about, I'm also, in many ways, preaching to myself. I have to continually police myself to not fall to the temptation to be a wee bit nasty, mean, hateful, or rude. I love the story Anne Lamott relates ‚ÄúPlan B: Further Thoughts on Faith.‚Äù She writes about A.J. Muste, a life-long pacifist who, during the Vietnam War, stood in front of the White House night after night, for years, holding a lighted candle. A one person protest, conducted near the end of his life. One very rainy night, a reporter asked him, ‚ÄúMr. Muste, do you really think you are going to change the policies of this country by standing out here alone at night with a candle?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Muste replied, ‚ÄúI don't do it to change the country, I do it so the country won't change me.‚Äù So we ‚Äúshake the dust from our sandals‚Äù when we have to, and keep going, trying remind ourselves along with everyone else, to spread Jesus's  message of love, of inclusiveness, of joy, of trying to be the (say it with me) the only Jesus some folks will ever see; the only Bible some folks will ever read. And maybe, just maybe, to be that candle in the darkness for someone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tadZ8nCLBsI&list=RDtadZ8nCLBsI&start_radio=1"

Go on. How do you know it's a fabrication? Why would we believe *your* unsubstantiated position, when there are mountains of evidence in favor of the story being true? If you truly want to hear the reasoning of the scholars, read below: >Many scholars, whether they think the passage was written by John or not, conclude that the story faithfully records an actual event in the life of Christ. John David Punch highlights an array of commentators who, over the course of the last 120 years, have made this observation.2 If this assumption is sustained, then the historicity and truth claims are secured, even if the account is considered an interpolation. As George Beasley-Murray notes, there is, ‚Äúno reason to doubt its substantial truth.‚Äù 3 >The passage is quite in harmony with the character of Christ as unfolded in the Gospels. In his commentary, B. F. Westcott emphatically states, ‚ÄúIt is beyond doubt an authentic fragment of apostolic tradition.‚Äù 4 Carl B. Bridges, who considers the story an interpolation, notes that the passage meets the form critical standard of dissimilarity, which points to its historical authenticity. That is, the passage does not appear to have a source in first-century Judaism  (Jesus's lenient treatment of the woman is in opposition to the expectations of the Jewish people in Jesus's day), nor does it fit in with the early church's emphasis on sexual purity.5 >This criterion of double dissimilarity indicates the M. Metzger declares that the story has all the ‚Äúearmarks of historical veracity.‚Äù 7 Gary Burge points to three aspects that support the authenticity of the passage. These are: Jesus's refusal to be embroiled in the debate over how the death penalty should be carried out and critique of those who would condemn a sinner; Christ's unequivocal stand against the representatives of the Torah; and his unconditional forgiveness of the woman, based solely on his authority. Burge then concludes that the passage represents a ‚Äúunit of oral tradition,‚Äù historically accurate, but not included in the Gospels.8 Its historical authenticity has been recognized by believers throughout the centuries. As Jennifer Knust notes, the story was considered authoritative and reflective of an actual event, and thus considered ‚Äúgospel‚Äù even when it was not found in ‚Äúa Gospel book.‚Äù 9 Source: [Pericope Adulterae: A Most Perplexing Passage](https://digitalcommons.andrews.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3292&context=auss) (1/2)"
n1oibn4,2025-07-06 18:58:04,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Chat gpt got me this: If you're dealing with month-long constipation, that's a serious medical issue. Solving it in 2 days ‚Äî especially if you're asking for a brutal but effective method ‚Äî is risky and should only be done under medical supervision, especially if there's a possibility of fecal impaction (which is likely after a month). However, here's the most aggressive but commonly used plan that doctors may employ in hospitals ‚Äî but again, do not try this without talking to a healthcare provider: ‚ö†Ô∏è EXTREME 2-DAY CONSTIPATION CLEANOUT PLAN (for serious cases) ‚úÖ Step 1: Assess for Fecal Impaction If you feel rock-hard stool in the rectum, can't pass anything at all, and have bloating/pain ‚Äî you may need manual disimpaction or enemas before anything oral will work. In that case, start with enemas. Day 1: Disimpact and Loosen the Block A. Enema Therapy Use one or more of the following: Microlax (fast acting) Fleet enema (phosphate-based, strong) Mineral oil enema (if hard stool, helps soften) > Repeat every few hours (max 2‚Äì3 in a day) until something comes out. B. Oral Osmotic Laxatives (draw water into colon) Start drinking: Polyethylene glycol 3350 (Movicol, MiraLAX) ‚Äî 17g in 250ml water every hour, up to 8 doses. Optional: Combine with Magnesium citrate 150‚Äì300ml once (strong, causes rapid diarrhea). Day 2: Full Cleanout (if stool is moving) C. Stimulant Laxatives Bisacodyl (Dulcolax): 10‚Äì20mg orally in the morning. Or: Senna: 2‚Äì4 tabs. > These cause colon contractions. Best taken after the stool is softened from PEG/enema. D. Keep Drinking PEG Continue PEG doses (2‚Äì4x daily) to cause diarrhea-like flushing. Drink lots of water or electrolyte fluids to avoid dehydration. Optional Add-on: ‚ùÑÔ∏è Suppository Bisacodyl suppository: 10mg rectally inserted in the morning for rapid response. ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warnings If nothing comes out after enemas and PEG, and you feel severe pain, vomiting, fever, or bloating, go to the emergency room ‚Äî you might have a bowel obstruction or megacolon, which is dangerous. Do not do this if you have kidney problems, heart failure, or are very elderly ‚Äî high magnesium or phosphate can be dangerous. Would you like a shopping list or schedule for this? Or are you considering a hospital visit?"

mov_63D7A8CFEE2B7C68638E8C0CCCB0E101,2025-07-07 06:26:45,en,WEB,"‚Äâ July 7th, 2025 ( The Volokh Conspiracy  - Delivered by  Newstex ) There is much to say about the Supreme Court's decision in Kennedy v. Braidwood Management, Inc. The majority opinion by Justice Kavanaugh and the dissent by Justice Thomas disagree on just about every point. But one area where there is substantial agreement concerns the line between an ""Officer of the United States"" and a mere employee. Indeed, I think the majority and dissent state this issue with more clarity than in previous cases. Justice Kavanaugh's majority opinion explains: The Appointments Clause in Article II of the Constitution specifies how ""Officers of the United States,"" as distinct from employees, must be appointed. 2, cl. 2. I don't recall seeing the word ""distinct"" used in this context. Here, the Court draws a bright line between an ""Officer of the United States"" and a mere employee. And what is that line? Quoting,Lucia, Justice Kavanaugh explains the line turns on whether the individual exercises ""significant governmental authority."" An officer exercises ""'significant authority pursuant to the lawsof the United States.'"" Lucia v. SEC, 585 U. S. 237, 245 (2018). An employee, by contrast, does not exercise significant governmental authority. See ibid. Justice Kavanaugh does not quite say that employeescannot exercise ""significant authority."" He says theydo notexercise such authority. Still, I think a plausible reading of Justice Kavanaugh dissent is that an employeecannot exercise ""significant authority."" If an employee could exercise ""significant"" authority, then there would not be a distinct line between ""Officer of the United States"" and an ""employee."" Indeed, without this line, Congress could vest unaccountable employees--who are not subject to the Appointments Clause--with this great power. And with great power, comes great responsibility. Stated differently, great power requires great accountability. (I tried to  get this line out during oral argument, but couldn't quite finish.) Further, Justice Kavanaugh reinforces this distinction with his summary of the facts: Before 2010, members of the Preventive Services Task Force were not officers at all. The Task Force was an advisory body, and the Task Force members made only non-binding recommendations. As a result of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, however, the Task Force's ""A"" and ""B"" recommended preventive services now must be covered by health insurers at no cost to the insured. For that reason, the parties here agree that the Task Force members exercise significant governmental authority and qualify as ""officers"" of the United States. They disagree, however, over whether Task Force members are principal or inferior officers. In other words, because the Task Force members exercise ""significant authority,"" they cannot be employees; they must be ""Officers of the United States"" who are appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause. The majority ultimately holds that the Task Force members are inferior officers. I don't quibble with that holding here. Justice Thomas's dissent draws the same distinction between ""Officers of the United States"" and employees: The Clause prescribes the exclusive means of appointing ""'Officers of the United States.'"" Lucia v. SEC, 585 U. S. 237, 244 (2018). Officers are Government officials who exercise ""'significant'"" federal authority on an ""ongoing"" basis. Id., at 245-246. Those who do not exercise such authority are mere nonofficer employees and are not subject to the Clause's requirements. Id., at 245. [FN1] [FN1] The parties agree that the exercise of ""significant authority"" marks the dividing line between officers and nonofficer employees. Brief for Petitioners 2 (internal quotation marks omitted); Brief for Respondents 4-5. I will assume that this view is correct for purposes of this opinion.But see Lucia, 585 U. S., at 254 (THOMAS, J., concurring) (""The Founders likely understood the term 'Officers of the United States' to encompass all federal civil officials who perform an ongoing, statutory duty-no matter how important or significant the duty""). Again, I would read the Thomas dissent to support the proposition that employees cannot exercise ""significant authority."" Were Congress to vest a position with such power, that position must be filled under the auspices of the Appointments Clause. After the Court called for supplemental briefing in Braidwood, Seth Barrett Tillman and I offered this  analysis: If the positions of Task Force members are not filled consistent with the Appointments Clause and Inferior Office Appointments Clause, that is, if members are not appointed under the authority of a statute, then the purported office-holders are not officers of the United States of any stripe, principal or inferior. At most, they would be ""employees.""..."

However, effective cleaning ‚Äì tooth brushing twice a day, with the removable of debris from interproximal spaces ‚Äì isn't easy for some patients. Dexterity is something that many people may take for granted, but for those that cannot clean their dentition with ease, their clinician is a primary source of support. Dental professionals need to be aware of prominent dexterity issues, and how they may affect a wide array of patients. They should also understand the aspects of an oral hygiene routine that can be most difficult, and identify opportunities to use alternative oral hygiene adjuncts. Making a connection Hand dexterity is the ability to perform small, precise hand movements with flow and accuracy. [i] Some studies differentiate manual ability and manual dexterity, with the latter describing the proficiency of the skill to perform a manual task depending on factors such as cognition. [ii] Complications may be seen throughout the entirety of an oral hygiene routine. Take the use of traditional dental floss as an example. A patient needs to take floss from a dispenser, which uses unilateral or bilateral gross motor movement of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, and fingers; then onto the action of flossing itself, they require fine motor control with manual dexterity of the arms, hands and fingers once more. [iii] Studies have shown that manual dexterity is linked to the effectiveness of dental flossing,iii and some that focus on patients in residential homes have found that manual dexterity can be connected to the amount of dental plaque present.ii Where more plaque is present, patients are more likely to develop periodontal infections, which can be severely damaging in the long term. Patients affected Causes for limited dexterity vary, but one of the most well-known connections is age. This, alongside grip strength, is a significant predictor of hand dexterity. [iv] Maintaining oral health into old age is paramount, as tooth loss can be severely detrimental to general health. Edentulism, which may come from periodontal disease, impacts mastication and makes bolus formation difficult, which creates dysfunctional swallowing. This may lead to a change in diet, and an avoidance of harder foods such as meat, fruits or vegetables, which can lead to malnutrition. [v] The effects of malnutrition include an increase in severity of oral infections.v Rheumatoid arthritis is another potential cause for concern. It is the most common inflammatory arthritis and affects around 1% of the UK population,[vi] with women under 50 around four to five times more likely to be affected by men ‚Äì though this disparity diminishes with age. [vii] As well as changes to systemic immune function, rheumatoid arthritis can cause physical impairment, most frequently affecting the wrist, proximal interphalangeal joint (middle of each finger) and the metacarpophalangeal joints (knuckles). vii This complicates oral hygiene routines, especially those that utilise traditional dental floss. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis are found to have a greater risk of periodontal disease.vii Other causes for limited dexterity may include cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and stroke. [viii] These may appear in a patient's medical history, or the individual could volunteer the information during an appointment. Engaging in a discussion around the difficulties faced when performing an oral hygiene routine can then help clinicians recommend the right alternatives for a patient's needs. Recommending alternatives Powered toothbrushes have been recommended in the literature for individuals with decreased manual dexterity, owing to an improved action and control over tooth cleaning. [ix] By implementing this solution, the research even states that any individual can use good brushing technique, and experience greater plaque removal and improvement to gingival health, irrespective of manual dexterity. Water flossers have also been recommended for patients lacking manual dexterity[x] as an alternative to traditional flossing, and should still be used alongside tooth brushing. Patients can disrupt plaque and debris with jets of water, using the different pressure options typically available, and they are also able to target bacteria beneath the gingival margin. Patients should be sure to choose high-quality and clinically proven adjuncts above all else. Clinicians can recommend those from Waterpik‚Ñ¢, the only water flosser brand to be approved by the Oral Health foundation. With an easy-to-use oral hygiene solution in the Waterpik‚Ñ¢ Cordless Advanced water flosser, patients can remove up to 99.9% of plaque from treated areas in just three seconds. [xi] Plus, it is clinically proven to be up to 50% more effective than traditional dental floss for improving gum help. [xii] Dexterity may make oral hygiene routines challenging, but not impossible. Clinicians can provide support to patients in appointments, as well as through appropriate recommendations for oral hygiene solutions. This helps more patients maintain their dentition, for more healthy, bright smiles. For more information on WaterpikTM¬†water flosser products visit¬†www.waterpik.co.uk.

n1wvrf1,2025-07-08 01:55:09,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ So‚Ä¶ your second paragraph kind of‚Ä¶ stressed me out as it just spreads misinformation. The Greek Bronze Age didn't really write things down -mythologically- they kept a writing form in later Bronze Age something called Linear B and it was primarily used administratively. It was not overly complex but it was used for tracking goods and people during the palatial period. None of the ‚Äúmyths‚Äù were written down in story or legend at that time‚Ä¶ they gave some references to some gods only when they were listing offerings given to them. While it's possible there was a more complex writing system that simply didn't survive we have not found any evidence of that‚Ä¶ Instead the other slightly earlier writing system Linear A, for example, has far fewer inscriptions left, so not all of it con be deciphered, but what has been deciphered was essentially that it was also used for lists -even simpler ones than Linear B. Then there's the Cretan Heiqoglyohics which were only a hundred years or so older than Linear A, and contemporary with Linear A for a while until they were replaced with Linear B (more or less) and as it stands the Cretan Heiroglyphics are undeciphered to this day. Also, the Greeks didn't stop writing things down during the dark ages per se. There are many things that contributed to the collapse of the Bronze Age in Greece and began the ‚Äúdark ages‚Äù but that's sort of broad way to describe the recovery from the collapse of the Bronze Age into the Iron Age. The palaces were destroyed, commerce was non-existent‚Ä¶ but in some places communities were intact and in many cases there were new buildings. Then there was a large increase in population and many new expansive buildings were built on top of the destroyed palaces. It was during this time (and likely in the Bronze Age) that bards and poets kept track of the past with poems and hymns as we know them as oral histories, these are cultural memory. But something miraculous happened. They adopted the Phoenician alphabet. Because while Greece was recovering from the collapse, the Phoenicians started expanding westward at about the same time. Then Hesiod wrote the Theogeny, and either a person or a group of people under the pseudonym Homer, wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey. They were documenting the oral history that had been told to them. They Homeric myths were widely accepted so the oral histories seemed to be quite prolific and at best contained a multitude of myths from various regions laid out in a chronological format that told a broad story. The Theogeny itself relating the ancestry of the gods themselves -how Heidi understood it. Medusa is first mentioned in the Theogeny as the third sister of the gorgons."

Whether you're wanting to treat yourself to that Ninja gadget you've had your eye on, or you want a new vacuum with a longer battery life, Amazon is the place to be for the next few days. From garden furniture to all the beauty essentials, you can expect to find thousands of products slashed in price during this mega-sale. However, you will need to be an Amazon Prime Member to benefit. Members need to spend ¬£8.99 a month for the subscription, but this comes with a variety of perks. Prime members can get next day delivery on thousands of selected items, along with access to Prime Video and Prime Music. Article continues below For those who are unsure if they want to start up a membership, Amazon is offering a 30-day free trial that shoppers can cancel at any time. You can view the full Amazon Prime Day sale here. Today we have found a toothbrush that has been discounted by a whopping 63%. The Oral-B iO3 Electric Toothbrush can now be purchased for ¬£59.99, instead of its original retail price of ¬£160. This means shoppers can enjoy nearly ¬£100 off. The Oral-B toothbrush comes with two toothbrush heads, pressure sensor and a travel case. The product comes in a shade of matte black. Its description says customers can buy the product for ""healthier gums in just one week"" and it removes ""100 percent plaque"" compared to a manual toothbrush. Customers can protect their gums with the iO pressure sensor. This is Oral-B's only sensor to signal if you are applying the pressure for an effective and safe clean. Everyone has different requirements when brushing their teeth, and the Oral-B product offers three cleaning modes. These are daily clean, sensitive and whitening. The high-tech electric toothbrush is designed with advanced technology and exceptional oral care features, it has been reviewed by over 15,000 customers. From the reviews, the product has obtained a rating of 4.5 stars out of a possible five and over 1,000 people have purchased it in the past month. One five-star review said: ""I've been using the Oral-B Smart 6 for many months now, and honestly, I'm really impressed. It's my first ‚Äúsmart‚Äù toothbrush, and I wasn't sure if the app features would be gimmicky, but they've actually helped me improve how I brush. The real-time feedback (like if I'm pressing too hard) has been surprisingly helpful."" A second reviewer, also leaving a five star review, claimed that their teeth felt ""dentist clean and whiter"", they wrote: ""Upgrading from my Oral B Pro I did a bit of research, I'm not the toothbrush expert but just really wanted to say that this toothbrush is the best one I've ever purchased, highly recommend it. ""Honestly, my teeth feels dentist clean due to the new i03 high quality build and powerful mechanism. It will be the only toothbrush you'll need for the next 2+ years!"" Article continues below However one three-star review found the documents that accompanied the toothbrush 'useless'. The review said: ""While the toothbrush seems to clean teeth ok , The instruction documentation is entirely useless. ""A few images with no indication to what they refer. Not good enough. . The multilingual sheet of paper tells practically nothing. IMHO (in my honest opinion) the documentation destroys any confidence in the product which looks well made and appears to have many settings if only they were properly documented."" If a toothbrush is not what you are after this Amazon Prime Day, we have found other deals that might be of interest to you. This includes Amazon knocking over 50% off Fire TV Stick for less than ¬£30 in huge Prime Day deal. This can be found here."
mov_290DD233CE2452783E1C50741757AE96,2025-07-08 10:00:00,en,WEB,"‚Äâ LAUSANNE, Switzerland, July 08, 2025 ¬† ¬† Comphya SA, a clinical-stage MedTech company pioneering the first implantable neurostimulation therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED) unresponsive to medication, today announced the closing of an oversubscribed Series A financing round. Including the conversion of existing convertible loans, the round brings Comphya's total equity raised to CHF 7.5 million (~USD 8.4 million). ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to have the continued confidence of our investors, which enables us to accelerate our mission to bring a transformative solution to men living with erectile dysfunction following treatment for prostate cancer,‚Äù said Pim van Wesel, CEO of Comphya. ‚ÄúWith our U.S. pilot study underway and preparations beginning for a pivotal clinical trial, we're entering an important new chapter in our development.‚Äù Proceeds from the Series A will be used to: Launch and execute a U.S. pilot study, with the first site activated at Johns Hopkins following FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval announced in January 2025. Prepare for a pivotal U.S. clinical trial planned for 2026, including regulatory and operational groundwork. Expand Comphya's ongoing clinical trial in Australia, where early data has shown strong safety and efficacy signals by recruiting additional patients. The funding comes on the heels of highly encouraging clinical results from the company's first-in-human study in Australia, where patients undergoing robotic-assisted prostatectomy were implanted with Comphya's CaverSTIM‚Ñ¢ system. Results presented at the 2025 American Urological Association (AUA) Annual Meeting in Las Vegas showed that a large majority of patients maintained good erectile function postoperatively without the need for adjunctive therapies. No infections or adverse events were reported. These early outcomes underscore the potential of CaverSTIM‚Ñ¢ to fill a major gap in post-prostatectomy care, an area with no effective therapeutic options today. The U.S. pilot study, now underway at Johns Hopkins, builds on the strong early data from Australia. Combined insights from both regions will guide the design of a pivotal clinical trial in 2026, which Comphya plans to fund through a forthcoming Series B round. The Series A round also coincides with recent leadership changes at Comphya, including the appointment of industry veteran Pim van Wesel as CEO in May 2025 to guide the company through its next stage of clinical growth and strategic execution. Comphya's neurostimulator system is the first implantable therapy designed to restore natural erectile function by stimulating the cavernous nerves. Founded in 2017 as a spin-off from¬†EPFL in Lausanne, the company aims to redefine the standard of care for patients who do not respond to conventional therapies. About CaverSTIM‚Ñ¢ CaverSTIM‚Ñ¢¬†is the first implantable neurostimulator designed to restore erectile function. This innovative technology is primarily intended for patients who are non-responders to oral medications, such as post- prostatectomy patients. CaverSTIM‚Ñ¢¬†is a neurostimulation system composed of an implantable pulse generator (IPG) containing a rechargeable battery and electronics responsible for generating the electrostimulation signal. It is connected to an array of two electrodes (with multiple individual electrodes) to be implanted in the pelvic cavity, where they will activate and restore the nerves responsible for penile erection. The IPG is implanted subcutaneously in the lower abdomen and is remotely operated by external controllers. The clinician controller allows the medical expert to adjust and tailor the system parameters to best suit each patient. The patient controller enables the patient to activate the device and deliver electrical stimulation to the cavernous nerves with the aim of restoring their function. About Comphya SA Comphya¬†is a medical device company based in Lausanne, Switzerland, developing CaverSTIM‚Ñ¢, the first implantable device to restore erectile function in patients non-responsive to oral drugs. Today, these patients resort to intrapenile injections or penile implants, the only available yet painful, problematic, and outdated therapies. Comphya's patented solution offers a unique and superior treatment for erectile dysfunction. The company's goal is to offer physiological sexual function and quality of life to large parts of the male population in great need.

1luoytj,2025-07-08 13:45:40,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ **Indications:** - Positive ASO titer - Initial Infection could have been strep (ENT) - Possible Guttate Psoriasis **Asymptomatic Strep Carriage / Chronic Colonization:** Group A Streptococcus can harbour in an individuals tonsils, throat, or nasopharynx for years with no sign of infection. If the immune system can't clear it effectively T-Cells can overreact and lead to immune responses and post infectious sequelae like Guttate Psoriasis and PANDAS (Paediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Infection) **Group A Streptococcus (GAS)** 5-20% of children are chronic GAS carriers. Perhaps I was, explaining the yearly tonsillitis? GAS can form biofilms in tonsil crypts making them resist immune clearance. This is linked with psoriasis exacerbation. GAS proteins resemble human proteins, particularly keratin. Others include M Protein, Streptococcal Pyrogenic Exotoxins, GAS Enolase, Streptolysin O, DNase B. These have been linked with the following diseases: Rheumatic heart disease, PANDAS, Psoriasis, Neuroinflammation, Autoimmune Arthritis, ME/CFS. It's possible a chronic GAS infection is exhausting my immune system / T/B-Cells. Maybe it's not the primary player but taking it out (if it is even there) could swing my system around toward recovery. There is also evidence that it can cause the reactivation of EBV. Tonsillectomy does help with psoriasis proving chronic GAS is producing autoimmunity and T-Cell issues. **Testing** To test this I would need an anti streptolysin test (ASO titer). I have asked the GP based on my low positive result from years ago but pretty much been blown off. It's understandable, there are many reasons why someone might test low positive in a random one off ASO titer. I just think it's worth perusing based on my chronic tonsilitis as a child, the infection that triggered my POTS and Chronic Bounding Pulse was likely Strep Throat, I developed what looks like it could be Guttate Psoriasis soon after this (which is caused by Strep, and I still have the possible psoriasis 14 years later), and the only time I have had an ASO titer was several years after onset, when I wasn't ill with tonsilitis, and it came back low positive (as it would in chronic strep colonization cases). There are a number of problems with this theory. It might not be Psoriasis, I may have caught an asymptomatic strep infection at the time of the test, Strep throat may not have been responsible at onset of illness. I might have strep and it might be causing my psoriasis but it's just being opportunistic as my body / immune system is weakened through over means. and if I get rid of the strep it might have no impact on my POTS / CBP. Still I think there is like a 25% chance it exists and is having some impact on my chronic symptoms and like a 5% chance it's the cause of all my problems. I could get this test privately, prices range from ¬£100-200. There is also a home kit you can order for ¬£25, you take your blood at home then send it off to them? The websites not very clear on how that works. I could also see a skin specialist to see if they could identify the psoriasis as Guttate. The GP has indicated an unwillingness to go down that route. **Treatment** I could always to straight to treatment and see if I improve. Tonsillectomy if off the cards but there are other treatments: *1. Targeted Antibiotics* Clindamycin: Effective against GAS and Biofilms. Penicillin + Rifampin: Rifampin penetrates biofilms. This supposedly has a high success rate. Need to look into it further. *2. Probiotics* - Streptococcus Salivarius K12 (lozenges) Colonises throat and inhibits GAS growth via two bacteriocins, salivaricin A2 and salivaricin B, which are antimicrobial peptides that inhibit the growth of other bacteria, particularly Streptococcus pyogenes...."

1lv1svs,2025-07-08 22:05:08,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ NAD. Here is some background. 33 year old female. I drink regular soda and coffee occasionally. I very rarely drink beer and do not smoke. I brush 2x per day - using a manual toothbrush in the morning and an oral B OS electric toothbrush at night. I use Sensodyne and a prescription toothpaste for cavity prevention and sensitivity (dentist told me to add a little of each to my brush head). I use Act mouthwash in the morning and Listerine at night prior to brushing. My flossing ebbs and flows. I have flossed every day for the last month and a half otherwise it was a few times a week prior to that. I had braces from 18-20ish years old. I have a permanent bottom retainer on my front teeth. I have a clear retainer, like Invisalign, for my top teeth. I used to have one for the bottom teeth after a few crowns and fillings it didn't fit so I stopped wearing it. I was never told when or for how long to use my top retainer so I did stop wearing it regularly at night and would only use it for a week every few months. I have used it every day for the last month and a half at the recommendation of my dentist and it fits fine. It was a little snug at first but slips right in and out now. My most recent dentist appointment was about 1.5 months ago. It was with a different dentist at my same dental office. They noticed my top front teeth are loose with the two center teeth being worse. I've noticed too. My bottom front teeth hit the back of the top front teeth when I bite down. They have always done that even prior to braces. For YEARS (decades) I have clenched my teeth (anxiety). I have tried to stop and can't. I relax my jaw when I notice I'm doing it. They said it's loose ligaments from my bottom teeth hitting the back of my top teeth and told me to wear my retainer, brush, and floss because I am much more likely to get an infection and lose my teeth. She seemed accusatory and judgmental with the way she communicated about this issue like I take bad care of my teeth. The first thing she noted on my exam was demineralization ‚Äúfrom when I had my braces.‚Äù That's flat out wrong. ALL white spots on my teeth are from when I was younger many years before I had my braces. I took ridiculously good care of my teeth when I had braces and feel like I still do despite occasionally slipping on flossing and clenching my teeth. While my teeth look nice in photos they have never been ‚Äúhealthy.‚Äù I've been told I have weak enamel since I was in early grade school. I had to go to the hospital to have teeth extracted when I was in grade school. Constant cavities when I was younger. I have had maybe 3 cavities since I've been in my teens. The more I write about this the more frustrated I am with my recent dentist appointment. My dad has had dentures since his early 50s. My brother has dentures since 35. My mom was starting to lose teeth and had a bridge in her early 50s but has passed away. I'm terrified of my teeth deteriorating. I try really hard with my teeth so I can have them as long as possible. I am scared of teeth pain. The dentist gives me anxiety. I go twice a year. Really I guess I would just like some recommendations about how to prevent or reverse the loose front teeth. I feel like I'm so vigilant with them so it's really discouraging when I feel like what I do isn't enough or that the dentist doesn't trust me when I tell them how well I try to care for my teeth. Sorry for the length."

Here is some background. 33 year old female. I drink regular soda and coffee occasionally. I very rarely drink beer and do not smoke. I brush 2x per day - using a manual toothbrush in the morning and an oral B OS electric toothbrush at night. I use Sensodyne and a prescription toothpaste for cavity prevention and sensitivity (dentist told me to add a little of each to my brush head). I use Act mouthwash in the morning and Listerine at night prior to brushing. My flossing ebbs and flows. I have flossed every day for the last month and a half otherwise it was a few times a week prior to that. I had braces from 18-20ish years old. I have a permanent bottom retainer on my front teeth. I have a clear retainer, like Invisalign, for my top teeth. I used to have one for the bottom teeth after a few crowns and fillings it didn't fit so I stopped wearing it.

n246zfv,2025-07-09 04:06:50,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ It was a miracle for me, but here's a different spit trick im sure others do but for those who dont know it, it'll screw the drug companies out of a little money as long as you can handle it: After the pill dissolves, it still tastes like medicine, right? That's cuz there's a LOT of medicine in that saliva you've been swallowing or spitting into the sink. Instead, reuse it. Yup. Sounds gross, but in the A.M., use mint listerene. That brand or its generic. Not scope, not oral B, not listermint....MINT LISTERINE. It kills 99.9% of all bacteria. Half hour later (roughly) take your 1st dose, and as it dissolves, spit a bit at a time into an empty pill bottle. After you're done, the entire pill's worth of saliva should be in that bottle. Then pop it in the fridge. This way, you can reuse it as your second dose of the day - you'll just need to sip half at a time and leave it in your mouth longer. 20 - 30 minutes each half. I know it sounds gross but its ur own practically bacteria free saliva. There's still a ton of medicine in that saliva, that would normally go to waste. Another trick: use a toothbrush or your teeth to kind of roughen the surface of the inside of your cheek, and even under your tongue - this creates more surface area and disturbed capillaries which will allow more of the medication to be absorbed. Then at dinner time, do the listerene again & take your third dose of the day which is only your second pill and again spit that into a bottle which you can use later that night before you go to bed, at 3a. m. if you need it, or first thing in the morning. The idea is that we're trying to use two pills a day instead of three. Yes, I know. This sounds gnarly, but this shit is expensive, and if you've used the list ring like, I've told you there shouldn't be much bacteria if any at all in there. And if you've put it in the fridge, you've retarded the growth of that bacteria, hell, you could even freeze it. It only takes about 10 minutes. In a warm hand melt it. You could even put it in the freezer and leave it there in case at a later date & you are running low, you'll have some in the freezer that's been frozen, still good. If it dries up back into powder, add some hot water and shake it up.Good as new! The key is that we're trying to use less. Then start tapering down. Let's say you get 90 pills a month which is what I got. I used to get 3 bottles of 30 pills. I did 3 per day like that for a year and then decided to taper down. The first taper, was instead of taking a full pill with my brand new prescription, i dropped to 3/4 of 1 pill for the entire 1st bottle of 30. So effectively going from 8 mg to 6 mg, it's virtually imperceptible. Do that for the entire 1st bottle. 2nd bottle, as best you can, try to break a pill into thirds or get a medicine scale at Amazon for $10 and weigh it out. In ounces, 1 pill will measure .4oz, so its easy. So now you're getting 3 equal pieces and take 2/3 of a pill for the entire second bottle, so just over 5mg. Imperceptible. Each step i lay out is SO gradual so as to be unnoticeable. Your third bottle, go to half a pill, 4mg. Again, virtually imperceptible. So this fill, instead of lasting 30 days, the first bottle will last about 13 days, the 2nd bottle about 15 days, and the 3rd 20 days, so in total this fill will last about 45-48 days. Your doc will love you. This is a huge trust builder, too. Don't say youre tapering Tell him/her ""Im trying to take them only when I really need to!"" Then the next refill, when you get your next prescription of 90 pills, the 1st bottle of 30 go to a third of a pill. Just under 3mg. Second bottle, go from a third of a pill to a quarter of a pill, 2mg, and the 3rd bottle, break a quarter pill in half as best u can - roughly 1 mg. By now, you may be skipping doses...."

While challenges remain, many investors are strategically considering their next steps amidst these uncertainties. The expectation for many companies in the S&P 500 is an average year-over-year earnings growth of 5%. This projection carries both good and bad news. The encouraging news is that growth expectations have seen positive changes recently, particularly in the technology sector. Yet, the anticipated growth rate appears considerably slower compared to previous years. A significant factor influencing this deceleration is companies' wait for definitive updates regarding tariffs. Although the situation is becoming clearer, accurate forecasting remains a challenge for analysts and investors until all numbers are finalized. The Appeal of Blue-Chip Companies In light of this uncertainty, investors may find safety in large-cap, blue-chip companies. These firms are characterized by robust balance sheets, reliable cash flows, and significant pricing power. Here are three blue-chip stocks that not only benefit from positive growth trends and effective management but are also predicted to exceed overall market earnings growth in the latter half of 2025. 1. Alphabet: A Resilient Tech Powerhouse Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has recently faced challenges, underperforming compared to some of its peers in the tech sector. A main concern is the influence of generative AI on its search operations. This narrative will unfold over several years. However, in its recent quarterly earnings report, Alphabet showcased a remarkable 12% increase in revenue year-over-year, alongside a 49% surge in earnings per share (EPS). This robust growth was evident across all service divisions, notably through the rising popularity of YouTube. Crucially, the company's Google Cloud division continues to gain momentum, outperforming major competitors such as Amazon and Microsoft in terms of revenue growth rates. Alphabet is also pursuing cutting-edge initiatives including autonomous driving technology via Waymo, developing AI chips, and venturing into quantum computing.

Investors should keep an eye on Eli Lilly's expansive pipeline, which encompasses prospective medications for Alzheimer's and cancer treatments‚Äîsegments that are expected to flourish over the next decade. After peaking in the previous year, LLY stock has seen a decline of approximately 15%. Nevertheless, since reporting impressive quarterly earnings, showing year-over-year revenue and EPS growth of 45% and 29%, respectively, LLY has rebounded nearly 7%. Analysts anticipate earnings growth exceeding 34% next year, with a consensus price target of $1,012, suggesting potential gains of over 31%. While LLY is trading at a premium compared to the overall market, it remains undervalued against its historical averages. 3. JPMorgan: A Steady Choice for Secure Investments Bank stocks are often viewed as stable, and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) is no exception. With a breathtaking total return exceeding 256% over the last five years, JPMorgan proves that stability can lead to exceptional results. The banking sector has thrived on higher interest rates, contributing to substantial increases in net interest income. However, the market remains cautious as expectations of lower rates in the near future circulate. Regardless of interest rate movements, JPMorgan's solid balance sheet positions it favorably. Should rates decrease, the bank could experience increased loan demand with minimized default risk. Among the discussed stocks, JPM is projected to have the slowest earnings growth at about 7.2%, still surpassing the S&P average. This trend is common within bank stocks. Additionally, potential investors should consider the dividend yield, which stands at an appealing 1.92%. Frequently Asked Questions What are the main themes discussed in the article?

mov_CF16D484CFC69ED8B41E890DF4167E9D,2025-07-09 12:14:00,en,WEB,"‚Äâ ABU DHABI (ALETIHAD) SEHA, a subsidiary of PureHealth, the largest healthcare group in the Middle East, has announced the remarkable progress of a three-year-old patient, Nasser, at Salma Rehabilitation Hospital. Nasser was diagnosed with a spinal cord injury and required complete support for all activities of daily living upon his arrival. He had limited movement, particularly in his left upper limb, and minimal verbal communication. Nasser's rehabilitation journey reflects the significant difference that multidisciplinary care can make in paediatric recovery. From the moment he was admitted to Salma Rehabilitation Hospital, he received comprehensive care from a specialised team including physicians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and educators. Dr. Ashraf Elbatal, Consultant Pediatrician-Clinical Lead, Salma Rehabilitation Hospital, stated: ‚ÄúNasser, diagnosed with genetic muscular conditions and reliant on mechanical ventilation 24/7, continues to inspire us. Despite the complexity of his case, he remains full of life, supported by a clinical plan tailored to manage his symptoms and improve his quality of life.‚Äù Upon admission, Nasser exhibited muscle weakness, lacked head and trunk control, and was entirely dependent for mobility and self-care. Through intensive therapy, his physical abilities began to improve. He developed better control of his head and trunk, and now sits upright with supervision, uses a wheelchair independently, and can briefly stand with support. Kristopher B. Bantilan, Physiotherapist, commented: ‚ÄúNasser's cheerful disposition and resilience were evident during therapy. Each session reflected his growing strength, particularly in trunk control, and his enthusiasm motivated all who worked with him.‚Äù Occupational therapy contributed significantly to Nasser's independence. Previously fully dependent, he now feeds himself using both hands. ‚ÄúThis progress brings him closer to his personal goal of attending school,‚Äù said Deidre Diane Karfor, Occupational Therapist. ‚ÄúNasser can now sit with his peers at break time, feeding himself independently.‚Äù His communication also improved significantly. Initially limited to minimal Arabic and struggling with feeding, Nasser has progressed in both oral motor function and language skills. Targeted therapy enhanced his Arabic and introduced English to prepare him for school. Feeding therapy addressed sensory aversions, expanded his diet, and promoted healthy weight gain. Raadiya Rafiek Mohamed, Speech and Language Therapist, noted: ‚ÄúNasser's language acquisition has been outstanding. From using a single word to now communicating fluently in both Arabic and English, he has shown extraordinary engagement. His feeding milestones have likewise improved, with a broader acceptance of textures and flavours.‚Äù Salma's educational team identified Nasser's academic potential and integrated him into formal schooling. Jonathan Gianan, Education and Recreation Lead, stated: ‚ÄúDeveloping Nasser's Individualised Education Plan was a milestone towards his reintegration. At Salma, our commitment to inclusion and quality of life remains paramount.‚Äù Nasser's story highlights the transformative power of interdisciplinary paediatric rehabilitation. From total dependency, he has become a confident and communicative young child, demonstrating resilience, engagement, and remarkable progress. With continued support, Nasser's future remains full of promise."

mov_35AA256E59751DEBCBDB13BD55AF863B,2025-07-09 12:56:30,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Background Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by localized telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations, caused by mutations in genes such as ACVRL1 and ENG. The global prevalence of HHT is estimated to be approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals.1 Previous research has shown that its molecular mechanisms are closely linked to the BMP9/10 signaling pathway.2 In contrast, moyamoya disease (MMD) is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by the progressive narrowing of intracranial arteries and the formation of abnormal collateral vessels. MMD has a higher prevalence in East Asian populations, but the prevalence in China is lower than in other East Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea, with a rate of 1.01 per 100,000 people.3 RNF213, the major susceptibility gene for MMD, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase critical for angiogenesis and vascular remodeling.4 Although these diseases have distinct clinical manifestations, both involve abnormalities in vascular development and remodeling. Their coexistence in a single patient is exceptionally rare. This study presents the first reported case of HHT coexisting with MMD, providing insights into the potential synergistic interaction between ACVRL1 and RNF213 genetic variants and their role in complex hereditary vascular diseases. Case Presentation The patient, a 45-year-old female, presented with a six-year history of recurrent bilateral epistaxis that had worsened over the past year. Six years ago, she began experiencing spontaneous bilateral nosebleeds without any apparent triggers. These episodes were recurrent but resolved spontaneously. Over the past year, the frequency of epistaxis increased to 2‚Äì3 episodes per week, with poor response to repeated electrocautery treatments. Symptoms were aggravated by actions such as bending forward or exertion. Physical examination revealed scattered red, pinpoint telangiectasia on the face, oral mucosa, and fingertips. Nasal endoscopy showed classic ‚Äúrose petal-like‚Äù vascular telangiectasia in the nasal mucosa bilaterally (Figure 1A‚ÄìD). The patient denied neurological symptoms such as headache or dizziness and had no history of trauma or surgery. Family history was notable for her son having occasional nosebleeds, while her parents were healthy. She reported no history of hypertension, diabetes, or other chronic illnesses. Figure 1 Clinical, Radiological, and Genetic Findings in a Patient with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and Moyamoya Disease. (A) Telangiectasia on the tongue mucosa. (B) Telangiectasia on the skin of the fingertips. (C and D) Nasal endoscopy showing characteristic telangiectasia (‚Äúrose petal-like‚Äù appearance) on the nasal mucosa. (E) Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealing reduced distal branches of the bilateral anterior and middle cerebral arteries, with abnormal small collateral vessels, consistent with moyamoya disease. (F and G). Telangiectasia observed on the gastric mucosa during endoscopy. (H) Pedigree of the proband's family. The arrow indicates the proband (the patient), black symbols represent HHT-positive individuals, and slashed symbols indicate deceased family members. (I) Sanger sequencing results of the proband and her son. Red arrows indicate the identified genetic variants: ACVRL1 c.1231C>T in the proband and RNF213 c.13685C>T in both the proband and her son. Auxiliary Examinations Laboratory tests revealed a hemoglobin level of 83 g/L and an elevated reticulocyte count (85.9 √ó 10^9/L), indicating moderate anemia with compensatory bone marrow hyperplasia. Coagulation parameters and biochemical markers were within normal limits. Gastrointestinal endoscopy identified multiple sites of Telangiectasia (Figure 1F and G). Brain MRI and MRA (Figure 1E) showed a marked reduction in distal branches of the bilateral anterior and middle cerebral arteries, along with scattered small vascular networks, consistent with the typical imaging features of MMD. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in the ACVRL1 gene (c.1231C>T, p.Arg411Trp) and a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance in the RNF213 gene (c.13685C>T, p.Pro4562Leu) (Figure 1I). Bioinformatic analysis suggested a high likelihood of pathogenicity for the RNF213 variant, with a CADD_phred score of 18.2 and a REVEL score of 0.146 (Table 1). Based on clinical manifestations, imaging findings, and genetic testing, the patient was diagnosed with HHT 2 coexisting with moyamoya disease. Table 1 Bioinformatic Analysis of ACVRL1 and RNF213 Variants Identified in the Patient Genetic testing of the patient's 21-year-old son revealed inheritance of both the ACVRL1 and RNF213 variants. While the son experienced occasional episodes of epistaxis, brain MRI did not show any features indicative of moyamoya disease. Differential Diagnosis This case necessitates differentiation from the following conditions: Von Willebrand Disease (vWD): While vWD is characterized by mucosal bleeding, it lacks the hallmark telangiectasia observed in this patient. Moreover, vWD is typically associated with abnormal coagulation parameters, which were not present in this case. Systemic Vasculitis: Although systemic vasculitis can involve cerebral vessels, it does not exhibit the characteristic imaging features of moyamoya disease. Additionally, systemic vasculitis is often accompanied by signs of systemic inflammation, which were absent in this patient. The coexistence of a pathogenic ACVRL1 mutation and an RNF213 variant, along with the clinical features, confirms the diagnosis of HHT combined with moyamoya disease. Treatment and Follow-Up The patient underwent local hemostatic treatment for HHT-related bleeding and anemia correction therapy. Regular follow-up was arranged to monitor the progression of cerebrovascular abnormalities and assess the potential risks associated with moyamoya disease...."

Wayfinding is a process of utilizing cues from the natural world to orient yourself, to know yourself and where you are, and to find, in conversation with yourself and the natural world, a path towards a destination. Wayfinding: Human Intervention, curated by Jordan Barrant as part of the Roots & Culture CONNECT Residency, looks at three artists employing methodologies of wayfinding through a response to colonial interventions and the creation of their own. The exhibition features Renee Royale (b. 1990), a research-based and process-oriented visual artist based in New Orleans and Chicago; Aidan Anne Frierson (b. 1998), a Chicago-based papermaker; and Maya Davis (b. 1999), a Detroit-based multidisciplinary artist. Rooted at the intersection of Black Geographies and Feminist Ecologies, this exhibition looks to theorists Katherine McKittrick and Anna Tsing to understand how artists respond to the historical and ongoing interventions by colonial enterprises into our natural world, and how they, in response and in conversation with it, create their own material-based interventions. The exhibition also considers concepts of humanness as articulated by Sylvia Wynter and the dehumanizing of Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities. It suggests that, potentially, for those communities, those that commune with the land are finding ways towards newer versions of humans, ones that operate in cohesion with other lifeforms. Each artist in this exhibition presents their own form of wayfinding, both in their work and life, searching for paths through their conversations with their surrounding landscape, submergences into the environments, and interventions through their varied practices, and thus, assertions of humanness. Accompanying the exhibition, a short publication with the same name will be published, featuring essays from the curator Jordan Barrant, writer Talia Wright, and art conservator Tempe Stewart. The zine will comprise essays dissecting the concept of wayfinding and the human interventions the artists embark on. The zine will be made available August 15 and will be published digitally on August 10 during the Submerging at the Site event. The exhibition will feature three events, a virtual Co ‚Äì Facilitated Q & A with the artists, curator and zine writers on August 10th, a Curatorial Walk through on August 17th and a Papermaking Workshop on August 24th. Aidan Anne Frierson (b. 1998, Chicago, IL) is an Artist and Educator from Chicago primarily practicing Handmade Papermaking. Her practice prioritizes Cotton, emphatically positing the material as ‚Äúthe reason Why We Are Here‚Äù. Through Handmade Papermaking, she activates material by engaging with color, texture, size, pattern and form. She honors history as a material by embedding ephemera in relationship with cellulose. Frierson's work is a culmination‚Äì‚Äìa form‚Äì‚Äìof material storytelling and diaristic cartography, that reflect memory's interdependent relationship with reality. Frierson is the Executive Director of the North American Hand Papermakers, and her public programming, education work, and cultural practice has shown up collaboratively in spaces such as: Hyde Park Art Center, Chicago Public Schools, Dieu Donn√© Papermill, Hook Pottery & Paper, Smart Museum of Art, and Penland School of Craft. RENEE ROYALE (b. 1990, Brooklyn, NY) is a research-based and process-oriented visual artist whose practice operates at the intersections of media, philosophy, and ecology. Her work bears witness to how film-based artworks and artifacts contribute to and are permanently altered by engagement with ecological degradation and colonial histories. By foregrounding media materiality and its entanglement with ecological systems, she addresses broader questions about temporality, belonging, and the legacies of Black ecologies. Her art has been featured in publications including liquid blackness, SEEING BLACK: Photography in New Orleans 1840 and Beyond, A Nation Takes Place: Navigating Race and Water in Contemporary Art, and an artist's book, Landscapes of Matter. She has exhibited work at various institutions including the Minnesota Marine Art Museum, Winona, MN; Contemporary Arts Center, New Orleans, LA; Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA; Macalester College, St Paul, MN; Echo Contemporary, Atlanta, GA; Tulane University, New Orleans, LA; Antenna Gallery, New Orleans, LA; and ICOSA Gallery, Austin, TX. Maya Davis's (b. 1999, Lansing, Michigan) artistic practice explores the interconnected concepts of care, preservation, and resilience through diverse media and processes. They examine care as both an intimate act and a collective responsibility, drawing parallels between human experiences and natural systems. Central to their work is an investigation of transformation and endurance, particularly through materials that embody cyclical patterns of damage and repair. Through research-based approaches, Davis cultivates and transforms organic materials, creating works that embody histories of adaptation and survival. Their practice examines complex relationships between colonization, displacement, and belonging that shape both communities and ecosystems. By interweaving biological, historical, and personal narratives, Davis invites reflection on our collective responsibility to nurture shared environments and the human capacity for adaptation within a world marked by both trauma and healing. Davis has participated in residencies and fellowships with organizations such as Independent Curators International, Modern Ancient Brown, and Bulk Space. Their work has been featured in galleries including Good Weather (Chicago), White Columns (New York), and the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. Davis has received support from organizations such as Culture Source (ARC Fellow), Red Bull Arts (Detroit Mini-grant Recipient), MdW Coalition (Artist Organizer Fellow), and Petty Propolis (Visionary Resistance Fellow). Jordan Barrant (b. 2000, Boston, MA) is a Chicago-based writer, curator, and interdisciplinary artist whose work explores the cosmological intersections of the ineffable, the American South and the Caribbean, with a focus on land-based and intuitive practices. Through oral histories and archival research, Jordan views the past as an invitation to imagine brighter, more loving futures. She received her bachelors from Spelman College in the Women's Studies and Art History Department and her Masters from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the Visual and Critical Studies department. She was the co-curator of The Black Domestic at SITE Galleries. She has participated in an Artpace San Antonio Curatorial Residency, a Chicago Artist Coalition Curatorial Residency and the New Local Space Kingston Residency and has received fellowships from the Pulitzer Center and the Fulbright Program. Her writing has been published in Burnaway, the Chicago Reader, the Boston Art Review, Sixty Inches from Center and the Black Embodiments Studio: A Year in Black Art.

1lvpf41,2025-07-09 17:52:29,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ This is a highly specific series of questions, and I fully intend to pose them to my doctor at my next appointment. But since that's still weeks away and curiosity is getting the better of me, does anyone has informed takes on a.) connections between HRT and thyroid issues, and b.) whether it's okay to take progesterone only when needed rather than religiously every month. My story, briefly: After months of terrible sleep, fatigue, and night sweats, I was prescribed 100 mg of progesterone, taken cyclically. It worked well without significant side effects, but a few months in, I developed a toxic thyroid nodule that was causing hyperthyroidism. I stopped taking the progesterone - perhaps unwise, but I wanted to know which symptoms were caused by my thyroid vs. perimenopause, since there's so much overlap - but still felt good for several months, even as I awaited thyroid treatment. My sleep quality was high, I wasn't sweating at night, my energy levels were even. Then this last menstrual cycle, the old symptoms came raging back: sweats, nighttime anxiety, insomnia. This leads to my questions. Mostly out of curiosity, is it possible that the progesterone triggered the thyroid issue? I know there's interplay between the two but don't have the medical background to fully understand it. And more importantly, as our hormones fluctuate wildly during perimenopause, is there any harm skipping oral progesterone when we're feeling good and then restart if/when our perimenopausal symptoms start raging again?"

A whopping 40% off the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro (that's $100 off, an all-new lowest price ever!) . With active noise cancellation, spatial audio, three silicone tips for customized fit, and over 24 hours of listening time with the included case, the AirPods Pro 2 give you a *ton* of bang for your buck. Promising review: ""I bought these going into it ‚ÄúI'm going to hate them.‚Äù But these have surpassed every expectation I had. My friend was talking about the noise in a call one day and it made me annoyed and these have something weird with Apple phones where they can block out almost all noises while making calls for the person you're calling and for you. Everyone knows Apple has their own technology work better with their phones or whatever it's no hidden thing, but let me tell you, these sound so crystal clear when listening to music, social media, and on calls. The quality alone is so nice! And the features, immerse (you can listen around you) adaptive (it'll block out white noise and annoying sounds) and noise cancellation (you can't hear just about anything around you) it's so wild. These things aren't even that tight in my ears but it's like you put noise cancellation on and it shuts off the outside world. I have this as a mechanic and it's just white noise everywhere with these in it's so comfortable walking around the shop having like ear plugs in essentially. Also, the battery life is great. I charged it fully when I got them and it's lasted me like a week on the case? I have my headphones in around 6 hours at work listening to social media. I probably take them out to charge them walking around the shop or going on break and I've never seen the buds really go below 80% after hours of listing tbh which is kinda wild. For the price it's worth every dollar and more. And to connect to your phone it's as easy as just opening the case and done."" ‚ÄîEthan Scott Price:¬†$149¬†(originally $249 (and currently $249 at Apple); typically $189.99 at Amazon) AirPods 4 are also a new lowest price ever ‚Äî 34% off with noise cancellation (down to $119), 31% off without (down to $89) 2. 40% off select colors of 40-ounce Stanley Quenchers ‚Äî because if you're going to add to your collection or hop on the Emotional Support Water Bottle bandwagon, you might as well save a few bucks while you're at it. Promising review:¬†""I used to make fun of people for using these Stanley cups; I always thought they were overpriced and overhyped. But I purchased this for my little sister who is in nursing school, and she takes this thing with her everywhere!!! All she does is rave about how amazing it is! So I bought one as well, and they really are amazing products. Made super well, they keep ice in them for hours and hours! Super comfortable to hold in your hand, not too heavy or bulky. Easy to clean and seem to be super durable. I've dropped mine I don't even know how many times now, and not a single mark! They also don't leak easy at all. Unless you're holding it completely upside down, even then it doesn't leak fast.

Learn more Keeping teeth healthy is so important and dentists will point out if they think a patient hasn't been brushing properly. There's an Oral-B electric toothbrush with ¬£100 knocked off the price in the Amazon Prime Day sale that shoppers are calling the 'best one I've ever purchased' and say 'even my dentist commented' on the difference. The Oral-B iO3 Electric Toothbrush has been reduced from ¬£160 to ¬£159.99 for a limited time. It promises healthier gums in just one week by removing 100 per cent more plaque vs a manual toothbrush. The iO pressure sensor flags whether the user is applying the right pressure for an effective and safe clean, while the iO light ring timer lets the user know when the dentist-recommended two-minute brush time has passed. The toothbrush features three cleaning modes - daily clean, sensitive and whitening, while the round brush heads help to reach where rectangular manual brushes don't. Meanwhile, the long-lasting lithium-ion battery means the brush can run for longer between charges. Oral-B is also offering shoppers a 30-day money-back guarantee. The Oral-B iO3 Electric Toothbrush has more than 15,000 reviews on the Amazon website, giving it an average customer rating of 4.5 out of five stars. One shopper said: ""I'm not the toothbrush expert but just really wanted to say that this toothbrush is the best one I've ever purchased, highly recommend it. Honestly, my teeth feels dentist clean."" One shopper said: ""Definitely a significant upgrade on the previous generation of Oral-B brushes. Provides a better level of clean/polish that you notice with your tongue. Build quality is also improved."" Denise said: ""Have left it a good while before I reviewed this product to see how it was over a few months of daily use. Wow what a difference this has made, I've always used an electric toothbrush and they are great but this is terrific! ""Most electric toothbrushes let you know if you're brushing too hard but this one tells you when you're not using enough pressure and I've realised I've not been using enough pressure all these years! This has honestly been a game changer and even my dentist has commented."" And another fan wrote: ""Highly effective at cleaning teeth, gums and tongue. Dentist says my dental health has improved significantly since I've been using this."" However, a few people complained that the enclosed instruction booklet was unhelpful, as one reviewer said: ""While the toothbrush seems to clean teeth ok, the instruction documentation is entirely useless. A few images with no indication to what they refer. Not good enough."" Shoppers can save ¬£100 off the price of the Oral-B iO3 Electric Toothbrush on Amazon. Other retailers are also running sales at the same time as the Amazon Prime Day sale, including Boots, which has slashed the price of this Oral-B iO2 Electric Toothbrush Simple White with Travel Case from ¬£100 to ¬£45.

mov_49ACC9CCF6BFDAC2A1FEEA32790C4B56,2025-07-10 10:29:04,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Link to Image Link to Story Chennai, July 10 (IANS) The custodial death of 27-year-old private security guard B Ajith Kumar in Tiruppuvanam, allegedly due to police torture, will now be probed by the Special Crime Branch of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), New Delhi. Sources confirmed that the CBI headquarters has entrusted the case to its Special Crime Unit, which is also handling the infamous 2020 Sathankulam custodial deaths of P Jayaraj and J Bennix. The move comes after the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court directed the CBI to take over the probe and submit its final report by August 20. The court also instructed the Tamil Nadu Police to fully cooperate with the central agency during the course of the investigation. CBI officials from Delhi are expected to formally assume charge of the case soon by registering a fresh FIR, once they receive the report of the judicial inquiry conducted by the district judge. ""The registration of the case is currently in process,"" an official source said. Ajith Kumar, a native of Tamil Nadu, died on June 29, allegedly after being subjected to brutal custodial torture by a special team of police personnel. The assault reportedly took place during an interrogation based on an oral complaint related to the theft of jewels from a parked car near the Badrakali Amman Temple in Madapuram. Following public outrage and legal intervention, the case was transferred to the CBI, and six police officers were arrested in connection with the incident. The state government, in response to the High Court's direction, issued a Government Order (GO) to facilitate the transfer of the investigation to the central agency. Earlier, the Madras High Court had directed the district judge to conduct a detailed inquiry into the incident. The court's latest order reiterated the urgency of the matter and stressed that the CBI must submit its findings before the deadline. The bench also reminded the state police to offer all necessary assistance to ensure a transparent and thorough investigation. The Tiruppuvanam custodial death has reignited concerns over police brutality and custodial violence in Tamil Nadu, drawing parallels with the Sathankulam case that had sparked national and international condemnation.

Renasant is developing a pipeline of oral small molecule corrector and first-in-class potentiator therapies that directly target the underlying biology of ADPKD, with the goal of restoring the function of key polycystin proteins across multiple different mutations to halt disease progression. Renasant has raised $54.5 million in seed funding, co-led by founding investor 5AM Ventures, alongside other leading life sciences investors including Atlas Venture, OrbiMed and Qiming Ventures. The seed financing will support further progression of Renasant's lead corrector program and ongoing discovery efforts for the company's first-in-class potentiator program. ""ADPKD is a devastating genetic disorder that affects more than 12 million people globally and still lacks truly disease-modifying therapies,"" said Emily Conley, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Renasant. ""Our platform of differentiated correctors and first-in-class potentiator therapies are designed to directly address the underlying cause of ADPKD across its broad mutation spectrum, offering the potential to benefit the vast majority of patients."" Next-Generation Corrector and Potentiator Programs for ADPKD Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a chronic, progressive genetic condition marked by the progressive formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, often leading to end-stage renal failure. The condition arises from mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, which encode polycystin proteins PC1 and PC2‚Äîcritical regulators of kidney cell function. The genetic mutations underlying ADPKD are extremely heterogeneous, with no single mutation found in more than 2% of patients. Disease-modifying strategies that correct or potentiate polycystin biology must overcome this diversity‚Äîmaking therapies that work broadly across mutations a key treatment advancement for ADPKD. Current therapies do not directly address the underlying protein dysfunction and are limited in their applicability and tolerability. Addressing the Underlying Biological Drivers of ADPKD Renasant's therapeutic strategy is centered on restoring the normal function of PC1 and PC2. Through its leading expertise in ADPKD biology, including electrophysiology and polycystin channel physiology, Renasant has developed proprietary assays to assess protein trafficking and other key mechanisms, enabling precision-guided development of novel therapies for ADPKD. The company's lead program is a small molecule corrector designed to work across a wide range of disease-causing mutations to stabilize and properly fold PC1/2, promoting protein trafficking to restore kidney function. The program is currently progressing through preclinical development. In addition, Renasant is advancing discovery efforts toward a potentiator to enhance ion flux through the polycystin channel and support anti-cystogenic signaling‚Äîa first-in-class approach in ADPKD. Correctors and potentiators can act as stand-alone therapies, or they can be combined for synergistic effect. ""Our corrector program is designed to work across a broad range of mutations, and our potentiator represents a novel mechanism of action in ADPKD,"" said Gus Gustafson, Ph.D., chief scientific officer. ""These programs hold the potential to reshape the treatment landscape. We are very encouraged by our preclinical data and committed to rapidly advancing these programs for patients in urgent need."" Team of Leading Experts in ADPKD Renasant is led by a world-class team with deep expertise in ADPKD biology and a proven track record in building biopharma companies. The team includes researchers who have shaped the field of polycystin biology and electrophysiology, seasoned drug developers, and biotech executives experienced in advancing cutting-edge scientific approaches. ""5AM Ventures founded Renasant around a bold idea: that we could change the trajectory of ADPKD,"" said Deborah Palestrant, Ph.D., partner at 5AM Ventures. ""ADPKD is one of the most complex diseases in renal medicine, but Renasant has assembled the right team, with years of research experience in polycystic disease that has informed the right scientific approach. We're proud to have supported the company from the start and are energized by its progress and commitment to delivering truly disease-modifying treatments for ADPKD patients."" Renasant's executive team includes: Emily Conley, Ph.D., chief executive officer Gus Gustafson, Ph.D., chief scientific officer B. Barry Tour√©, Ph.D., senior vice president, drug discovery Rachel Gallagher, Ph.D., vice president, biology Michelle Ho Huey, Ph.D., vice president, strategy & operations Renasant's board of directors includes: Natalie Holles, chair of the board Kevin Bitterman, Ph.D., partner, Atlas Venture Evan Caplan, M.D., principal, OrbiMed Emily Conley, Ph.D., chief executive officer Anna French, D. Phil, managing partner, Qiming Venture Partners USA Charlotte McKee, M.D., chief medical officer, Sionna Therapeutics Deborah Palestrant, Ph.D., partner, 5AM Ventures In addition, Renasant has assembled a scientific advisory board consisting of preeminent leaders in ADPKD genetics, biology, and both preclinical and clinical drug development.

If you are the conservator of the estate, talk to the attorney who helped you with the conservatorship to ""marshal"" your mom's assets and income sources. You may have to pursue a court order to get the assets and income turned over from your sister. In the meantime, go to the Social Security website to apply to become your mother's ""Representative Payee"". This will allow you to receive her SS deposits on her behalf, and use them for her needs. Be sure you understand the rules concerning acting as her ""rep payee"". Understand that if your sister is already rep payee, she will be notified of your application and may cause more trouble. Medicare takes your mom's  Part B premium from her monthly Social Security , and Tricare is her ""supplemental"" or ""Medigap"" plan that should cover the rest of her medical care, including short term PT and OT. But Memory care (room and board)  is NOT covered by either, so you need a way to pay for it from her finances. Memory care is licensed as residential care for the elderly/assisted living and is considered a form of custodial care--that's not a Medicare or Tricare benefit. Unfortunately, for the most part, Medi-Cal does not cover memory care either, with a few exceptions. We do have an Assistive Living Waiver program in California, but the waiting list is huge and it's very difficult to get placement, although she might be considered a priority. Not all places participate in the Assisted Living Waiver, so if you do get it she may have to move to a different facility. As for the teeth, you need to find an oral surgeon with hospital privileges and that oral surgeon's office should help you figure out where the procedure can take place,  the payment and what, if anything, might be covered by Medicare. Sadly your story is not unique, it's all too common, unfortunately. Thank goodness you have stepped in."

He provides answers to an issue affecting an estimated one in five Canadians. Q. What are the main causes of hair loss? A. For men, causes can include: - The most common is androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness), driven by a genetic predisposition and sensitivity to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that stimulates the development of male characteristics. - Shifts in hormone levels, particularly those affecting DHT. - Medications for depression, high blood pressure, acne, arthritis, gout or fungal issues. - Other factors, like stress, nutritional deficiencies, or underlying health issues such as autoimmune disease or thyroid problems. For women, causes can include: - Genetics and hormonal fluctuations, for example, during pregnancy or menopause. - Disorders like thyroid imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome, or autoimmune diseases. - Other factors like high stress levels, nutritional deficits, and hairstyling practices, such as tight hairstyles or chemical treatments. Q. What are the main treatments for hair loss? A. For men, treatments include: - Medications such as topical and oral Minoxidil helps stimulate hair growth and oral Finasteride works by reducing DHT levels. - Surgical and other advanced options can be hair transplant procedures and low-level laser therapy or platelet-rich plasma treatments, but the results are mixed. For women, treatments include: - Medications such as topical and oral Minoxidil is often recommended. - Anti-androgen treatments, such as spironolactone, can balance hormone levels. - In some cases, hormonal therapies, such as oral contraceptives, may help regulate imbalances. - Additional options can be low-level laser therapy and platelet-rich plasma treatments, which have mixed success. - Hair transplant may be considered in select cases or hair prosthesis (hair piece or wigs). - Complementary strategies would be nutritional support, such as iron supplements, and stress management. Q. Do you recommend any lifestyle changes to help reduce hair loss? A. Yes, there are several lifestyle recommendations, including: - A balanced diet, which can ensure adequate intake of protein, vitamins (especially B vitamins and vitamin D), iron, and other essential nutrients. - Stress management techniques such as regular exercise, mindfulness, or meditation to reduce stress-induced hair loss. - Avoid excessive heat styling, chemical treatments, and hairstyles that pull on the hair (tight ponytails, braids, etc.) Use mild, nourishing hair products. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle, including sufficient sleep and hydration. Regular health check-ups can help identify and manage any underlying conditions that might contribute to hair loss."

(TSXV:KDOZ)(OTCQB:KDOZF), a global leader in safe digital media and advertising technology and developer of the market-leading Kidoz Contextual Ad Network that connects brands with audiences through content analysis rather than user data, is proud to announce the launch of Kite IQ - the company's proprietary AI platform, designed to deliver category leading contextual targeting at scale. Kidoz helps brands build meaningful connections with audiences in safe, high-performance environments, without compromising privacy or safety. Kite IQ uses advanced machine learning and semantic analysis to classify mobile apps across theme, content, and audience appeal. By enriching every app with real-time contextual metadata detecting genre, themes, age-group appeal, and gender targeting through a combination of natural language processing and similarity modeling, Kite IQ enables brands to match their message with the right audience in the right environment increasing the value of campaigns, while maintaining full compliance with global privacy regulations. Kite IQ doesn't just categorize apps; it interprets them. ""For too long, advertisers have been forced to rely on generic store tags that say little about the real content or audience of an app,"" said Jason WilliamsCEO at Kidoz, ""Kite IQ advances our unique personal data-free capabilities by combining machine learning classifiers and semantic intelligence. We give brands a new level of control, context, and confidence in every impression thereby delivering higher value campaigns. Kite IQ will also provide details of the campaign to customers to prove value."" ""Kite IQ delivers high-accuracy classification, empowering brands to align their campaigns with the right content and audience resulting in higher engagement and improved click-through rates driven by stronger contextual relevance. All of this is achieved while maintaining full compliance with global privacy standards like COPPA and GDPR."" he added. The launch of Kite IQ, alongside the recently announced PRADO SDK, represents the culmination of a multi-quarter R&D investment in building Kidoz's next-generation technology stack. From AI-powered contextual intelligence to flexible monetization infrastructure, these foundational developments mark a critical transition from product development to scalable commercial deployment. While this strategic focus on investment positions Kidoz to capture greater long-term value across the mobile media ecosystem, the broader market uncertainty recently experienced due to threatened tariffs may impact our second quarter results, expected to be released near the end of August. ""Advertisers need measurable returns on their investment, especially in an era where traditional targeting is becoming obsolete,"" said Ryan Lexer, VP Strategy at Kidoz. ""Kite IQ represents the first stage of our broader AI strategy to optimize campaign performance and drive increased returns on advertising spend.

mov_B4889BCE0FB424AF12AAAA0FA42B8DA4,2025-07-11 06:02:37,en,WEB,"‚Äâ The use of ambiguity is a staple feature in many forms of art. In Romeo and Juliet, Mercutio, after being stabbed, says ""ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man."" Shakespeare deployed ambiguity to great effect, in order to create ""a constant but fluctuating separation between the reader and text, the literal and figurative, and the expressed and implied."" Poetry - from Milton's ""fruit of the forbidden tree"" to Elizabeth Bishop's ""the ties ... too close together"" has always utilised ambiguity to proliferate meaning. More recently, abstract expressionist art thrived on ambiguity, taking it to be ""its own reward."" The Supreme Court's 10th June ""order"" on the Bihar election rolls, authored by Dhulia and Bagchi JJ., is either a fragment of Shakespearean drama or a poem in the tradition of Bishop - or perhaps a piece of abstract art. It must be one of these three things, because we know what it is certainly not: a judicial order delivered by a constitutional court. The context of yesterday's hearing has been discussed in some detail in Vasudev's blog post yesterday, which was published before the written order was uploaded to the Supreme Court's website. The case was brought to Court because the Election Commission's decision to conduct a ""special intensive revision"" of Bihar's electoral rolls in the run-up to the state election, which required all voters who had been enrolled after 2003 to ""re-enroll"" and demonstrate their eligibility to vote within a period of one month, risked causing widespread disenfranchisement in the state (for detailed analyses, see here, here, here, and here). Apart from issues around jurisdiction and disenfranchisement, there was also the Supreme Court's own prior precedent of Lal Babu Hussein, which made it clear that a generalised removal of individuals from the electoral rolls, and requiring them to prove their eligibility in order to be put back on those rolls, was unconstitutional. There were two clear and defining features of the case before the Court: its seriousness (mass disenfranchisement goes to the very heart of the democratic process, and of democratic legitimacy) and its urgency (the draft electoral rolls are to be published on August 1). Given its legal assessment of the matter, there were also a range of constitutional remedies open to the Court, which would protect voting and citizenship rights: from an interim stay of the process (given the proximity of the state elections) to more modulated orders (for example, stipulating that those individuals who had been on the Special Summary Roll that had been finalised as recently as January 2025 could not be mass-removed from it). At the very least, one would expect that a constitutional court, when faced with such a case, would accord it the seriousness that it deserves, and write a reasoned order explaining and justifying the position that it took. Indeed, on 10 July, the Court had all the tools to do so: the case was argued over the course of four hours (enough time for a final hearing, before most courts), with both sides presenting their arguments in some detail. Informal live records of the oral hearing also show that the bench put detailed questions to both sets of counsel. Unfortunately, however, the order that followed - first, orally dictated in court, and subsequently published a few hours later - reflected none of this. Rather, it followed familiar pattern that we have come to expect from the Supreme Court in high-stakes constitutional cases: a pattern of ambiguity, evasion, and deferral (see here). After a brief recitation of both sides' cases, without any consideration of the legal arguments, the Court says:      ""... in our prima facie opinion, it would be in the interest of justice if the Election Commission of India also considers the following three documents as well (apart from the 11 documents mentioned in order dated 24.06.2025), i.e., A) Aadhar Card; B) Electors Photo Identify Card (EPIC), which is issued by Election Commission of India itself, and C) the Ration Card."" This sentence is the piece of abstract art that headlines this post: it is so deftly worded in order to avoid the burden of clarity and certainty, that it reminds me of that famous example of the ""triple pun"": ""A rancher who was ready to retire gave the operation of his ranch over to his two boys. He renamed it ""Focus,"" because it was where the sons raise meat."" * Well, here the Supreme Court seems to be communicating a triple meaning: is the Election Commission (a) bound to accept these three documents if presented to it, or (b) ""consider"" them on a case to case basis, or (c) ""consider"" whether to include one or two or all of these documents as proofs of citizenship in the SIR process? Is this even a judicial order, or is the Court engaging in a philosophical disquisition of what the interests of justice might require? Would it have killed the Court to write in legal language: ""We direct the Election Commission to..."" or ""We declare that these three documents...""? Ambiguity plays a vital role in art, where proliferating meanings and open endings can enrich the process of interpretation. But in a case of a judicial order, where the voting rights of masses of individuals turn upon words, ambiguity is the most profound exemplar of judicial abdication, of a court failing to do its job. And ambiguity is not neutral: it favours the party that holds power, the party that can shape ambiguity to its own ends - in this case, the Election Commission. In the 10 July order, this ambiguity is coupled with deferral: the Court fixes the next date of hearing eighteen days later, on 28 July, and four days before the publication of the draft roll: by which time the process will be more or less complete, and will allow for a fait accompli to be presented to the Court as a constitutional argument for non-interference - a story that we have seen play out many times in the past. And finally, evasion completes the trinity of ambiguity, deferral and evasion: the Court gives no reason for its observations on these three documents (leading, once again, to civil rights becoming the gift of judicial patronage and negotiations rather than enforceable rights, as I've previously written), and does not engage with any of the other issues raised in the petitions (what, one might then ask, was this four-hour hearing for?) . In short, the Court does not do its primary job, which is to pass a reasoned, judicial order on an important and urgent constitutional case brought before it. One may ask: if the Court is unwilling or unable to pass a reasoned order in this case - which goes to the heart of the democratic process - when will it ever do so? Perhaps, in the absence of that, all that we are left to do is to admire what the Court does give us, on its own terms: no judicial order, but a piece of abstract art. * The triple pun is the sons raise meat/the sun's rays meet."
n2ibhhj,2025-07-11 07:08:10,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ An airplane just gets you from point A to point B. You can do that by walking/swimming/climbing with enough breaks etc. It would just take an unfeasibly long time, and probably involve piggybacking on a less advanced technology (flotation devices, special clothing and gear, etc.) For the moon question, it's also basically a question of distances. We could build a human pyramid to the moon and then jump in the direction of Mars. We would eventually be there if we jumped just right. Of course there's the whole radiation and oxygen problem, so we would (and do) have to use other scaffolding technologies (air supply extending the lungs, special textiles extending the skin, essentially extending the time you can hold your breath, the time your skin can be exposed to radiation, etc.) For the data encoding, there is nothing stopping us from memorizing chunks of binary, spreading that over a large group of people each responsible for a certain chunk and passing it down generation to generation (like story tellers in oral cultures). It's unfeasible but not impossible. The ¬´ unfeasibility ¬ª part is important to how tech (defined as any means of externalizing our internal conception of a potential world) changes our individual and collective consciousness. With each tech, things that we wouldn't even consider trying to do become suddenly feasible, therefore spawning new tech developments to bring that into reality, in a positive feedback loop. A vague dream becomes a long shot becomes a reality which spawns new dreams with an updated set of parameters of what is feasible. This of course is dangerous but apparently unstoppable. Since technologies have their origins essentially in ¬´ daydreaming ¬ª about potential realities, the arts are WAY ahead of engineers in defining and exploring avenues of development, since that is essentially what art does: project virtualities into symbolic form for sharing.

Thousands of deals are still live across laptops, electric toothbrushes, fans and more. What are the best Amazon Prime Day deals today? At a glance: You need to be a Prime member to access the deals, but Amazon is currently offering a 30-day free trial. After that, it costs ¬£8.99 a month and you can cancel any time before the trial ends. The Telegraph Recommended team, usually responsible for testing and reviewing products, is well-qualified to help you find the best genuine deals in the Amazon Prime Day sale. We've seen many sales events and know how to tell a good deal from a poor one. Read our tips on how to find the best deals to see how we do it. Every deal featured below has been checked using our filter system. This involves multiple team members, spreadsheets, and a healthy dose of scepticism. We don't just compare discounts to the RRP (recommended retail price). Instead, we track the average price of each product over six months and calculate the percentage decrease from that. Most products are rarely sold at their RRP, so we focus on genuine price reductions. We also only recommend items we've tested ourselves to ensure you're buying a product that works. Throughout the remaining hours of the sale, our experts across tech, home, garden, health, fitness, beauty, grooming and travel will post their top deals below, whether that's from the Amazon Prime Day sale or an even better offer from the high street that we think you should know about. Look out for deals on Shark, Ninja, Shokz, Eufy, Oral B and Amazon's own-brands like Kindle and Echo. We'll be here until 10pm to make sure you find real savings, and avoid anything that's not worth your money. There aren't tonnes of products for sale from those we've reviewed in our guides to the¬†best electric shavers, the¬†best beard trimmers and the¬†best hair clippers, but there are a couple. Here are the best: We've seen quite a few home security deals on popular brands like Eufy and Amazon's own-brands Ring and Blink. Here are the best deals we've found: It's always worth checking other retailers before you check out your Amazon basket. While we've been surprisingly impressed with the number of genuine deals in this week's Prime Day sales, there are still some products being sold for cheaper elsewhere. For example, the Asus Zenbook A14 is ¬£100 cheaper on Currys, despite it also being included in the Prime Day sales. Our reviewer, Alun Taylor, reckons it even gives an Apple MacBook a run for its money. ‚ÄúCompared to the MacBook, the A14 is better value once you've factored in a matching SSD, has a more colourful and larger albeit lower-resolution display, a better keyboard and more ports. It's also lighter and has better battery life.‚Äù Of course, the MacBook is still more powerful. You can find a good deal on the MacBook Air 2025 higher up this blog. Read Alun's full review of the Asus Zenbook A14 Surprisingly, we're not seeing many Prime Day deals on vacuum cleaners, which are usually well represented in Amazon sales. Dyson is running a sale, but many of its discounts were running before this week, and likely will continue after Prime Day. In our guide to the¬†best cordless vacuums, we have found one genuine deal on the¬†Gtech AirRAM, which is usually ¬£321.44. It's now ¬£281.30, which is a 12 per cent discount. In our guide to the¬†best vacuums for pet hair, the¬†Vax Air Stretch Pet Max, which is usually ¬£108.65, is down to ¬£79.99. That's a 26 per cent saving. Robot vacuums¬†are where we're seeing the most deals. Here are some of the best: Tonight. You can see a timer counting down in the top right corner of¬†Amazon's homepage. Amazon's Prime Day deals have been live since Tuesday, July 8. Some deals have only been fleeting, so if you see a deal you like the look of, it's worth acting quickly. You can usually bet on finding a decent deal on headphones during sales periods. We've done the hard work for you, scouring the Prime Day deals to find the genuine discounts on headphones we've reviewed: Our¬†Best Buy cordless fan, the¬†Duux Whisper Flex Smart Standing Fan has 15% off its usual price. Its average price over the last six months has been ¬£144. In the Amazon Prime Day sale, it's currently discounted to ¬£122.50. This isn't the cheapest price we've ever seen (it was ¬£15 cheaper in the last Prime Day sale), but it's still good value given the performance on offer.

The Telegraph Recommended team, usually responsible for testing and reviewing products, is well-qualified to help you find the best genuine deals in the Amazon Prime Day sale. We've seen many sales events and know how to tell a good deal from a poor one. Read our deals to see how we do it. Every deal featured below has been checked using our filter system. This involves multiple team members, spreadsheets and a healthy dose of scepticism. We don't just compare discounts to the RRP (recommended retail price). Instead, we track the average price of each product over six months and calculate the percentage decrease from that. Most products are rarely sold at their RRP, so we focus on genuine price reductions. We also only recommend items we've tested ourselves to ensure you're buying a product that works. Throughout the remaining hours of the sale, our experts across tech, home, garden, health, fitness, beauty, grooming and travel will post their top deals below, whether that's from the Amazon Prime Day sale or an that we think you should know about. Look out for deals on Shark, Ninja, Shokz, Eufy, Oral B and Amazon's own-brands like Kindle and Echo. We'll be here until 10pm to make sure you find real savings, and avoid anything that's not worth your money. 09:52 PM BST It's goodnight from us Thank you for joining us today. We hope you've managed to find everything you needed, for a genuinely good price. We'll be returning to our normal business of bringing you . No doubt we'll see you here again when sale season returns. It's only four months until Black Friday‚Ä¶ 09:36 PM BST Four tips for finding the best last-minute Prime Day bargains There are a couple of hours left to shop and it's easy to get caught up in the moment and buy something you may later regret. Before we log off for the day, here are some tips to help you shop savvily as the sale ends: Make sure you can't get it cheaper elsewhere: Use price comparison tools like Price Spy and Price Runner, look at your favourite high street retailers and consider second-hand options from trusted resellers like Back Market or Amazon Resale. Check to see if prices are genuinely at their lowest: Tools like CamelCamelCamel or Keepa show you how prices fluctuate throughout the year. This will help you assess whether you may be able to get it cheaper at another time and if it's as good a saving as advertised.Buy only things you already want: Try not to make a hasty impulse buy on something you haven't researched. If you've wanted it for a while, then you're less likely to regret your purchase.Think ahead: As we've said earlier, with the sun out you're unlikely to find discounts on garden furniture and most of the great deals on air conditioning have now disappeared. But if you know you need something in the autumn, like a dehumidifier, now may be a great time to buy. Demand for cold weather products is lower in July and therefore discounts may be better. Read our full advice on how to find the best deals 09:24 PM BST Why we're not recommending many smartphone deals Well, because there aren't many. Later in the year tends to be the better time to buy, since the new models mostly come out in early autumn. This is often followed by price cuts to the previous models. But, if your phone is in need of an upgrade and it can't wait, we have managed to find a few worth your consideration: 14% off Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra: Average price ¬£1,284, now ¬£1,04927% off Google Pixel 9 Pro: Average price ¬£936.41, now ¬£67914% off OnePlus 13: Average price ¬£912, now ¬£786.54 09:09 PM BST One of the best deals we've seen today Robot vacuums are increasingly popular.

1ly1f9p,2025-07-12 14:12:22,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Hello Everyone About 10 years back started noticing extreme harifall. Went to a doctor, he prescribed finasteride 1mg + minoxidil 2.5%, which was later increased to 5% then 7.5% and then eventually 10%. Used them for about 2-2.5 years with no results at all. Luckily there were no side effects either. Minoxidil did help grow those tiny babyish hairs but they never grew more than that. The shedding was extreme when it was started and when I stopped the medications and I don't think that the shedded hair were recovered, this makes me very scared of the shedding phase. Then after studies got stuck in a 9-6 job. I used to exercise whenever I got time and my diet was mostly clean. In the end of 2019, went for a transplant and got about 2000 hairs transplanted because I only wanted to cover the receeded areas in the front. Went to a small clinic rather than those big one's due to budget issues. They didn't prescribe finasteride or minoxidil to maintain and I was okay because I didn't get any results with them in the first place. Then covid hit hard. During the lockdown it was found that I have a congenital heart issue and my valve had to be replaced. I am on blood thinners and a medicine which keeps the heart rate low for life. And lo and behold this valve replacement has given me an ed for life. Went to an extreme depression phase due to this and due to some other personal stuff and my therapist prescribed some anti depressants few years back, though I have stopped taking them now. Fast forward to today, loosing native hair. My heart doctor says that I can take finasteride and use minoxidil, but told me to start from the lowest finasteride from the lowest dose and to monitor it regularly. But I just don't want to take the oral one. Few queries a.  Does it make sense to apply topical minoxidil which has finasteride in it? Has this combo given results to anyone and does it get absorbed in the blood? b. Is topical min + fin solution having any shedding phase when it is started or stopped? c. I used to use minoxidil which used to come in an oil/serum form but nowadays people are using the same in a foam form. Which one is better out of the two? And should it be applied only on the affected area or the whole head? d. Do PRP sessions really help? Is there any scientific research behind it? I have stopped taking them because a. the price have increased by like 5x and b. earlier the clinic used to run the blood sample in that machine for 15-20 mins and nowadays they run it for less than 5 mins. When I asked about it, they said that they have a new machine which processes it in less time, which I think is a crappy reason. e. Using baby shampoo like every alternate day as told by the clinic. Do I need to change this too after starting minoxidil? How does nizoral/keta shampoo help one here and how often should it be used? f. I have seen many people using a solution which has minoxidil + finasteride + dutasteride (or either one of them) + tretonin. Is fin + duta + tret combo needed? How does tret help one in a situation like this?"

1lyjm63,2025-07-13 04:08:44,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ As most people know, the official Oral B replacement heads are far too overpriced. The problem I have is that every generic branded replacement toothbrush head I've tried were subpar. Their fit is a little off, so there's a lot of rattle, and you can feel the fact that the head isn't vibrating as much/strongly as it does with an official replacement head. Because of this I'm apprehensive on buying generics online from Amazon/Temu/Aliexpress. I would be stuck with a bunch heads at once if they turn out to be bad (in addition to wasting money). The top listings always have a bunch of great reviews, but I can't help but think that many people either don't notice this flaw that I have, or have lower standards. Because there are some reviews that do point out the same issues I have. So does anyone know of a sure-fire way to get good quality generic Oral B toothbrush heads?"

Ogni volta che accettiamo passivamente una decisione presa altrove ‚Äì che sia un dazio, una guerra economica o un'ingiustizia globale ‚Äì stiamo solo rimandando il momento della nostra dignit√†. Ma c'√® una forma di attivismo che √® alla portata di tutti, ogni giorno, in silenzio e con coraggio: scegliere cosa comprare e cosa rifiutare. Dal 1¬∞ agosto gli Stati Uniti, per voce di Donald Trump, hanno annunciato nuovi dazi pesanti contro l'Europa e altri paesi. Una mossa unilaterale, punitiva, che rafforza l'idea di un mondo diviso in blocchi dominati da interessi privati. Ma noi, persone normali, abbiamo un potere che sottovalutiamo: il potere del consumo consapevole. Basta con l'America nel carrello Non stiamo parlando di odio, ma di coerenza. Se veniamo attaccati economicamente, se l'Europa √® trattata come colonia commerciale, perch√© dovremmo continuare ad arricchire le multinazionali americane con i nostri acquisti quotidiani?

Asus, Samsung, Bosch sono opzioni solide e fuori dal circuito USA. Smetti di pensare che non serva a niente. Serve eccome. Se milioni di europei smettono di comprare americano, il messaggio arriva forte. Colpisce dove fa pi√π male: nei profitti. Attivismo √® anche questo Non servono bandiere n√© cortei. Serve coscienza.

Although of course you may never get used to it, and that's ok! If the vibration in your hand is the biggest problem but you like it otherwise, you could consider wrapping the lower handle in something that muffled the vibrations, like that bendy foam that comes in packages sometimes, or just a washcloth. In any case, as other folks have written, you don't *need* to use an electric toothbrush, unless you want to. If you or your partner are concerned, using mouthwash after brushing is an alternative way to up your oral hygiene game. But honestly, if you're flossing already and brushing (not too hard) then you're doing great! If your dentist has concerns, you could consider changing your habits, but if not I wouldn't worry to much. I¬†stuck with it, personally, because I hate hate hate the feeling of anything on my teeth, and I feel much cleaner using my electric toothbrush. But that's a personal decision. I have an Oral B which I got specifically because it's a little quieter than others. It still makes noise though‚Ä¶ Generally, I try to distract myself by getting into a Wikipedia rabbit hole while I brush, or an article that I've been looking forward to. Honestly, the thing I like the least is that there's more 'spray' (sorry, gross!!!!) from the brush vibration, but I try to counter that by brushing right before I shower, or at least before I get dressed. If I'm too overwhelmed to do that, I'll let myself brush my teeth in the shower (usually while listening to an audiobook for distraction.)"
n2xbgzf,2025-07-13 16:54:04,en,REDDIT,‚Äâ They go on sale all the time. Monitor weekly ads and keep it in your Amazon cart. I only buy the Oral B heads on discount or with manufacturer coupons.
n2y0kq5,2025-07-13 18:56:47,en,REDDIT,‚Äâ Exception to this is any electric toothbrush. I got an oral b for 50 CAD off of amazon and it is so much better. Never had a single cavity since then.
