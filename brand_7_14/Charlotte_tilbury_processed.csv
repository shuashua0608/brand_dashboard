mov_306AA1924382C0774F32CB78D76002D5,2025-06-17 05:43:16,en,WEB,"  Coveting a healthy-looking color for summer skin? NEWBY HANDS asks five A-list makeup artists to share their best bronzer tips – from PAT McGRATH's beautiful 'sun-sculpted' look to GUCCI WESTMAN's ultra-authentic 'tan' and SIR JOHN's double-bronzer trick Gucci Westman “'Real' skin is my thing, and my makeup has always been about looking authentic, so, when I use bronzer, I like to blend it over my eyelids, forehead and cheeks, and take it right up under the eyes, where we naturally catch the sun – but I don't use it on the lower face. You don't apply bronzer like you do blush, as it's about pushing the skin to a deeper tone. Don't do that classic three-shape over the face, either – over the forehead, cheekbones and jawline – as it doesn't work. If you're naturally oily, I also use pressed powder around the nose and T-zone, then apply my Westman Atelier Vital Skin Foundation Stick as a concealer, applying it with the Spot Check Brush to target where it's needed so it's much more believable.” Pat McGrath “It's incredibly easy to enhance bone structure and add warmth to the face with bronzer – it's what I like to think of as a 'sun-sculpted' effect. Using a fluffy brush, start with a light touch and build up gradually, sweeping it within the depth of your cheekbones, along the temples and around the perimeter of the face. Applying it where the sun would naturally add warmth gives that perfect sun-kissed look, and I also love to add touches of bronzer to the nose to create the ultimate sun-sculpted finish. Powder bronzers are extremely long-lasting and blend seamlessly with foundation, blush and highlighter, too; the Pat McGrath Labs Divine Bronze Collection is formulated with a blend of oil-absorbing powders and uses translucent, soft-focus pigments to ensure that it leaves your skin with no cast or cake-like effect. When it comes to which texture is better – cream or powder – it depends on your preference. I do, however, recommend powder bronzer even if you're also using a cream. Powder bronzer is great for layering over cream bronzer to help make it longer wearing, and powder bronzers are also quite easy to apply and blend.” “I always do two bronzers: a cream and then a powder. Even when I do brows, I use a pencil, then set it with a shadow, and when I do a cream blush, I'll set it with a little bit of powder blush. That duality when you're using two [textures] gives you a Teflon-like base. Even if you're using the most minimal amount, I like to set things. I like to use a cream foundation stick as a bronzer (go for a shade that's deeper and warmer than your complexion) and buff it in with a big fluffy blush brush – it's a beautiful way to bring in a little bit of a halo effect with a bronzed glow. Buff it in, then don't be afraid to set it with a powder bronzer – I like the ones from Tom Ford Beauty or Nars. Where you start is where you'll deposit the most color, so begin away from the center of the face, around the hairline, then bring everything in [by blending] a little bit across the cheekbones, underneath the jawline – this is important as we all neglect that area – and across the bridge of the nose.” Katie Jane Hughes “My favorite bronzer texture is a cream formula, and I always apply it after skincare but before makeup. You want to blend it down the neck and chest if they are visible, and be sure to really reinforce your application along the hairline, too, to make sure it looks as natural and 'real' as possible.” Daniel Martin “To get that natural 'tan', I like using two fingers – ring and middle – to apply the bronzing product on the highest parts of the face. Using your fingers this way, and not a brush, means you have more control and can build up the color little by little, rather than applying it full throttle; I use my hands a lot to build up makeup. To get that second-skin finish, you want to feel as if you're working the bronzer into your skin – I do like Charlotte Tilbury's Beautiful Skin Sun-Kissed Glow Bronzers, as they have that velvety, creamy finish that will hold in the heat.” Summer accessories to amp up your glow 5 items RELATED READING The model featured in this story is not associated with NET-A-PORTER and does not endorse it or the products shown"

016278917CB2F38D1E666B4EE2D01596,2025-06-18 06:23:51,en,PRINT,"  In March, Asian Paints had a swish opening for Nilaya Anthology, its gallery-style decor store in the heart of space-starved Mumbai. Hailed as the most ambitious interior design showroom in the country, and spread across 100,000 sq.ft., it is the size of almost two football fields. At the launch, guests sipped Veuve Clicquot Champagne while admiring wares from Milan's haute design gallery Nilufer, Vikram Goyal's museum-worthy brass creations, and whole rooms devoted to bespoke Italian-designed kitchens, bathrooms, home spas and furniture from Europe and the Far East. In a city where fancy store openings happen on an almost weekly basis, it was, by far, the grandest, buzziest opening party. “This is easily India's most luxury-focused retail concept,” says Greg Foster, artistic director at Jaipur Rugs and former editor of Architectural Digest India. “To have designs from Nilufar, one of the world's most important galleries, alongside fabrics from some of the most prestigious European textile houses, fabulous carpets from Jaipur Rugs, certified Indian antiquities from Natesan's [and more], all under one roof, would be a fabulous concept anywhere in the world, let alone in Worli.” Foster recalls how the debut collection of art works shown by Sabyasachi's Art Foundation — a series of female forms by artist Atish Mukherjee, in a contemporary take on the Bengal School of Art — were sold out on opening day. The prices ranged from ₹13.5 lakh to ₹52 lakh, and “people were fighting to buy them”, he shares. India is experiencing a retail boom, and luxury consumers are increasingly spoilt for choice as a proliferation of high-end, museum-esque stores are opening across the country. Western high-end brands too are launching targeted collections for the Indian customer. Four years ago, Bulgari, the Italian luxury fashion house that retails, among other things, classic jewellery with price tags that can easily go over ₹1 crore, debuted its version of the mangalsutra. The brand, which priced the piece at a fraction of their in-house designs, at around ₹13 lakh, hired actor Priyanka Chopra Jonas as its brand ambassador. In 2022, Louis Vuitton, the French luxury fashion house, which generated €20 billion in revenue globally, produced a capsule Rani Pink collection of shoes just for India for the festive season. And last year, long-time Indophile and fancy shoe designer Christian Louboutin, whose designs walk down red carpets at Cannes and the MET Gala, showcased a Diwali edit with velvet and brocade sandals and stilettos embroidered with zari. Many buyers who once limited their purchases to when they travelled abroad are no longer waiting to do so, instead preferring to shop in India. A day before luxury content creator Pooja Advani was leaving for her summer holidays to the U.S., she got a WhatsApp alert from a salesperson at Le Mill in Mumbai. The chic multi-brand luxury concept store was letting her know that the latest Alaïa collection had arrived. Advani, known for her trendy style in the city's social circles, had wanted a pair of the celebrated Parisian brand's sandals, prices for which start at an average of $900 (approx. 77,000). She did a quick online price comparison between India and the U.S., and immediately bought it. “I got the tip in advance, they had my size, the price compared, and I didn't have to leave my home. It's these small conveniences that make it easier to shop for luxury in India,” she says. Advani is just one of many clients that the Le Mill sales team has been steering towards the most au courant fashion as soon as it lands in the store — through a mix of WhatsApp messages and calls. Hitesh Rathod, creative director of Le Mill, says: “Many key pieces are sold even before they get uploaded on our website because our VVIP clients know exactly what they want,” he says. Luxury retail is not just about exclusivity anymore, it is also about accessibility. Especially in India. Over the past decade, a new affluent class has emerged, as the start-up culture and rise in stock market performance led to greater wealth generation amongst the top 2% of the population, many of them younger entrepreneurs. This class is more brand conscious and globally exposed. And after COVID-19, there appears to be a psychological shift amongst the rich to enjoy their lives and live in the present. This means that while there are still big numbers online (the e-retail market has surged to approximately $60 billion in gross merchandise value, according to global management firm Bain & Company), there is renewed interest in offline. “We are definitely seeing a strong resurgence in offline retail, particularly in the premium and luxury lifestyle segment,” says Abhishek Agarwal, founder of Purple Style Labs, which owns Pernia's Pop Up, the multi-brand fashion store, which recently took over the lease of the iconic 53,000 sq.ft. Ismail Building in Mumbai's Fort neighbourhood. Its counterpart in Chennai, on upscale Khader Nawaz Khan Road, is equally popular among wedding shoppers who browse their aisles and iPads, the latter making it easier for shop assistants to source from stores anywhere in the country. “There is a noticeable rise in omni-channel behaviour, where people are browsing collections online but coming to our stores for a deeper experience. While the pandemic significantly accelerated digital adoption, physical retail has come back with greater experiential demand,” he adds. Pernia's Pop Up is planning more large format stores in Mumbai, Delhi and New York. The proliferation of big and new players across India is strengthening this, be it malls such as Palladium and Emporio or the Ambani's Jio World Drive — which opened in 2021 with a roster of luxury brands making their debut in the country — or single-brand stores. The Collective, Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail's multi-brand offering, for instance, is growing in scale, and recently opened three new stores, bringing its total number to 40 across India. Adding to the mix is a slew of international brands entering our shores. Swiss watch imports grew nearly 30% in the first three months of 2025. Brands such as Breitling opened new boutiques in Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune and Gurugram, while Frank Mueller has plans to expand in Mumbai. “Today's luxury retail is about immersion, not just inventory. Store formats — whether standalone or mall-based — are being designed to create a high-touch, narrative-driven experience,” says Pranav Saboo, MD & CEO, Ethos Limited. “At Ethos, we've adopted a hybrid model. Our mono-brand boutiques are housed in luxury malls to capture footfall, while our large-format experiential spaces like City of Time in Gurugram, allow for deeper engagement. Interestingly, we're seeing hefty-ticket purchases even in mall stores, provided the brand story and experience align with consumer expectations.” Long gone are the days when prestige beauty products — part of celebrities' skincare routines, from actor Jennifer Lopez (a La Mer fan) to musician Taylor Swift (Chanel and Charlotte Tilbury) — were covetously purchased by Indians while on holiday. Today, Reliance-owned Tira Beauty, which debuted in 2023 to focus on high-end beauty, has opened 17 stores across India, while Nykaa announced plans for 350 stores by the end of the year. At the launch of the sprawling Tira store at Palladium two months ago, women across age groups were testing YSL lipsticks, Estée Lauder and La Mer skincare, Prada perfumes and K-beauty offerings while sipping on cocktails and Champagne. “Having a big store like this in the heart of Mumbai to browse in and test products, with good sales staff is helpful...."

mov_FB6ED16290307B5F31FEEA60C86D16B9,2025-06-18 09:00:44,en,WEB,"  I have never known a category soar as suddenly as setting spray. It existed for aeons, with the best of them (Urban Decay's All Nighter, £29.50, which still has second-to-none longevity) rarely threatened by anything new. But countless sprays have launched in the past year, all of them promising to significantly increase the lifespan of makeup. There's an argument that “fixing sprays” and “setting sprays” have different purposes (locking down makeup versus providing a more unified, less powdery finish, respectively), but I dismiss it because it's based on the generous assumption that the marketeers who name products according to popular Google search terms give a hoot for semantic nuance. Here, I mean sprays that do all of the above, drastically reducing makeup fade and wear, even during dancing, hot flushing or perspiring. My favourite in recent years is Charlotte Tilbury's Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray (£32), since it best combines staying power with a natural, complexion-enhancing look. It scores extra points for its ability to stay smooth when powder or an evening makeup change is later applied over the top. When I arrived for a 16-hour day and realised I'd forgotten to apply this spray, I went to buy one But giving it a run for its money is Fenty Beauty's new You Mist (£28). This has a finer spray, no fragrance and comparable staying power. It doesn't have the same satiny look, but is similar in that it doesn't alter the texture of makeup. It's a fantastic product upon which I've become so dependent that last month, when I arrived in London for a 16-hour day and realised I'd forgotten to apply it, I went straight to Boots to buy one. The best setting spray on the high street is Milani's Make It Last (£14.50). It is an excellent performer at a fair price that keeps makeup fast without dryness, itchiness, tightness or colour changing. However, I specifically mean the spray marked “Original”. I recently bought the SPF version in the US and my eyes streamed profusely until I washed it off. The lasting effect of L'Oreal's Infallible 3-Second Setting Mist (£9.99) is phenomenal, but it is pipped by the Milani because it smells a bit too much like hairspray. If you find setting sprays feel too wet upon application, Kosas's new Cloud Set Airy Setting + Smoothing Mist (£32), does exactly what it says on the pack. The unfragranced, monsoon-like mist coats evenly, coolly and comfortably, and gives a smooth, slightly blurry finish.

mov_23407F6F0F4B1E9CAB56ACD92E79F1DE,2025-06-18 13:00:49,en,WEB,"  The summer jacket is one of the trickiest bits of your wardrobe to get right, because nobody really wants to wear one. I mean, isn't summer supposed to be lovely and warm? Isn't that sort of the whole point of a summer wardrobe? Sandals and shorts exist to celebrate carefree, balmy days. Sunshine is the raison d'etre of a sundress. The very existence of a jacket is a summer buzzkill. But you need one. Sorry, but you do. Seasons are unpredictable, heatwaves break, darkness brings a chill. So you definitely have to put some thought into a summer jacket unless you want your fabulous summer outfits to end up hidden beneath some random hoodie you grabbed off the banister. Your summer jacket needs to do two things. It needs to keep you warm and dry when the weather turns chilly or wet. And somehow, at the same time, it needs to keep your summer vibe bouncing along, rather than kill the mood. Like I said: tricky. The vibe works best when the jacket is deliberately mismatched, a contrast to the summery pieces beneath The most common mistake we make is to buy a summer jacket that is all summer and not enough jacket. Case in point: I once bought a jacket made of broderie anglaise. I was young and foolish, but still, what on earth was I thinking? In the changing room mirror, it paid visual lip service to the concept of jacket-wearing. The problem was, once I got outside, it wasn't actually warm. The most iconic summer jacket looks are where the jacket is there to do a job. It feels like a simple, low-key foil to summery clothes. I'm thinking of Alexa Chung at Glastonbury, in a waxed Barbour jacket over hotpants and bare legs. I'm thinking of Marilyn Monroe, hugging a sturdy Lee Storm Rider denim jacket over her flimsy white blouse on the set of The Misfits. The vibe works best when the jacket is deliberately mismatched, a contrast to the summery pieces beneath. You know that thing when you sling a tuxedo jacket – yours or someone else's – over your party dress to walk home? That. A Barbour jacket still works. I love my Barbour and will be once again wearing it at Glastonbury this year – the classics are classics for a reason, after all. And a denim jacket can be a brilliant holiday piece: it has pockets; blue denim is basically a neutral, so the colour works with everything; you can shove it on a luggage rack and it won't crumple, and the texture is a nice contrast over beachy crochet or linen. This summer, fashion is serving up three alternatives: the barn jacket, the leather blouson, and the haute anorak. The barn jacket (squared off and contrast-collared like this one by H&M) works for exactly the same reason a Barbour jacket does, so if you invested in one this winter, you are in clover. The leather blouson (roomy at the shoulders and sleeves, collared, and gathered at the hip) is the more lo-fi cousin of the biker jacket. Your reference here is either John Nettles in Bergerac, or Justin and Hailey Bieber on a courtside date night, depending on your vintage. At the most recent round of shows, the slightly geezerish leather blouson was edging out the blazer as the look to be seen scooting around town in, accessorised with a slicked-back bun and a banana-shaped bag under one arm. The haute anorak, like this one from Iets Frans, meanwhile, is exactly what it sounds like: a raincoat, but fancy. A raincoat like this which has main character energy is also a smart choice if not getting your hair wet in the rain is of equal concern to you as keeping warm. With Oasis back on stage any minute, this is the perfect moment to pull out your most obnoxious anorak. Wear it zipped to the chin for extra attitude. A caveat to this. None of it is going to work if you are going to, say, a wedding. For that you need a summer jacket that harmonises sweetly with your outfit, rather than riffing off it. A sleeveless dress with a matching jacket is a summer occasion investment worth considering here. But never forget: it's a hard pass on the broderie anglaise.

The luxury British beauty brand is now the official exclusive partner of the DCC for makeup, skincare, and fragrance, making this Tilbury's first-ever U.S. sports collaboration. The partnership comes on the heels of growing interest in the cheer squad, reignited by the viral success of Netflix's America's Sweethearts documentary.

It's here — in the intersection of discipline, beauty, and performance — that Charlotte Tilbury steps onto the field. “This is makeup you can dance and cheer all day and night in, that feels light-as-air and stays flawless,” said Charlotte Tilbury, president, chairman, chief creative officer, and founder of the brand. “I have curated a beauty wardrobe of cheer-proof beauty icons that are the perfect fit for the DCC.” The collaboration launched in early June and is more than just cosmetic — it's about confidence, performance, and self-expression.

Fans can expect immersive activations at AT&T Stadium, exclusive digital content with DCC stars, and even Charlotte Tilbury touch-up stations. For Charlotte Jones, Dallas Cowboys co-owner and chief brand officer, the match goes far beyond makeup. “This isn't just about beauty products,” Jones said in a press release. “It's about aligning with a brand that shares our values of empowerment, self-expression, and excellence. When women lift each other up, we don't just step — we leap into greatness.” Image Credit: Screenshot, X / @DCCheerleaders Image Credit: Screenshot, X / @DCCheerleaders Tilbury echoed that sentiment: “As a female founder, I'm so proud to support these remarkable young women and to create the looks that will define the 2025–2026 season.” MORE NEWS: TikTok Star's Toddler Drowns While Mom's Away, Dad Distracted by Newborn [WATCH] This isn't Charlotte Tilbury's first step into the sports arena.

And there's nothing worse than picking up a new tube just to learn that you can't, in fact, pull off the same bright red shade as Taylor Swift. Our beauty experts think the best lipsticks for everyone come in muted shades, like light pinks, beiges, and barely-there glosses. For this piece, we looked to beauty industry leaders like Allure, Cosmo, and our celebrity style gurus like Reese Witherspoon and Kelly Ripa. Each shade comes recommended from fellow beauty editors, stylists, Amazon shoppers, or our own staff members. Quick OverviewSee 10 more Swipe of these shades will give your pout some punch, even on those ""no makeup"" makeup days. No matter your skin tone or lip product preference, you'll be able to find a shade that's perfectly you on our list. Read on to discover all our favorite universally-flattering lipsticks below. For a kiss of barely-there color, opt for this fetching shade. This hyaluronic-acid-infused lipstick provides a natural-looking hue in a sheer application. Many reviewers on Amazon have professed their love: ""This is my all-time favorite lipstick! This is probably my sixth or seventh tube. I never repeat-buy lipsticks like that! It's so natural looking, but enough to give your lips a blush of color. I love that it has SPF too."" $35 at Amazon This gorgeous velvet lip tint is as much fun to apply as it looks. It doesn't look like a conventional lip stick (more like a nail polish bottle), but once it's applied, it provides an intriguing matte shade that looks incredible on all faces. Nearly 30,000 shoppers swear by it, calling it ""wonderful,"" ""lightweight,"" and their ""go-to shade."" $10 at Amazon How about a lip balm that creates a customized color just for you? Glimmer Balm glides on clear, then teams up with your skin's pH to almost magically create the perfect shade of pink to flatter your exact skin tone. It's also super moisturizing, giving the look of lipstick but providing the texture of a balm. One reviewer said: ""This lip balm is so amazing. I've never used anything like it before. You will love it, too. It has just the perfect shimmer, is barely noticeable, and it really does change color on your lips almost immediately. I am amazed at how long it stays visible; I've tried lots of lipsticks that claim to stay on and don't. This one really does. You're going to love it!"" $17 at Amazon This lipstick is a favorite among editors at Allure, who named it the best matte lipstick of 2024. It comes in nine satin shades and eight matte ones, all of which look gorgeous when applied. We particularly love the Classic - Neutral shade, which adds a bit of texture without drastically over-coloring your lips. $26 at Merit This moisturizing lipstick/balm hybrid delivers a pretty flush of color to enhance your natural lip shade while brightening your overall complexion. The color is buildable too, so you can reapply as needed until you find the coverage you crave. Nearly 2,900 verified Amazon shoppers adore this lipstick as much as we do and bless it with flawless five-star reviews. One said: ""The perfect sheer look with a hint of color; it smells great and feels really nice on the lips. It's perfect for a no-makeup makeup look, and the product looks expensive. Really good find — I'm glad I finally found the perfect lip moisturizer!"" $9 at Amazon We spotted Reese Witherspoon in this Clinique shade this year, and while she would look incredible in just about anything, we loved the way this lipstick shined. It comes in quite a range of shades, but we love the AM Blushing Pop color pictured here. $26 at Amazon Lip nourishment meets luminescent color with these shimmery faves! There are eight hues to choose from, each available in a 4-pack, but the Fig shade looks especially great on just about everyone. The formula is sure to please, too, thanks to therapeutic ingredients like sunflower oil and vitamin E. More than 5,300 Amazon reviewers love this one as their everyday lippie...."

Promising reviews: ""This stuff is so legit I've gone through three bottles. Adds the perfect glow to your skin!

Catrice ""Instant Awake"" Under Eye Brightener, which will be your holy grail for concealing and brightening dark circles under your eyes when your schedule is throwing you for a loop. This lightweight, color-adapting formula is designed for truly ~invisible~ coverage that makes a drastic difference — one that a lot of reviewers compare to the $33 Becca version. The color-adaptive formula is designed so one of two shades will work on any skin tone. Promising review: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable.

I personally will live, breathe, and die by the magic of $25 ""universal"" Black Honey version — it lasts FOREVER and also functions as the perfect blush — but it sells out so often that I am also deeply relieved to know it has a cheap alternative in case of lip emergency!

I am a Clinique Black Honey lip fan, and this gives me the same look for a fraction of the cost. I love it and have several that I keep in various spots.

myr29ix,2025-06-20 03:34:24,en,REDDIT,  So - I'm reading some comments here and looking at your photos and I have very similar eyes to you. First - I actually prefer your make up trial photos to all the rest. I think the lashes are really nice. I also know exactly why the artist didn't use liner all the way around into the inner corner - I have small eyes and that just makes them look even smaller and less open. I can not use liner into the inner corner. I've also read comments suggesting you put something in the bottom lash like mascara and/or liner. Like you - again I have small eyes as well as dark circles and some texture under my eyes ( literally same situation going on down there). Anything on my bottom lashes makes my under eye look darker and draws attention to imperfections there while again making my eyes look even smaller. I am also the same age as you I think and have the exact same skin and eye colour as well as hair colour. I can tell you what has worked for me. 1. Stick to dark brown eyeliner - the black is too harsh as we get older. I thought someone was going to have to pry my black eyeliner out of my cold dead hands but then I tried Charlotte Tilburys Feline flick eyeliner pen in brown. It's the perfect shade of brown. Not too dark- and not too cool for my ( our) skin tone. I highly recommend this. Black mascara is still more flattering than brown on me though. 2. The under eye situation has been the Bain of my existence. I have bought over 300 concealers - all of them aged my under eye making it look dry and crepey until I found the following products. I start with Sheiseido benefiance under eye cream. It's super rich. After it has soaked in a bit I put a tiny bit of the Sisley eye contour mask on top. This is expensive but amazing to use every night as well as under my concealer. I promise you will love this. If not - you can return it. Sisley takes returns and everything else I'm going mention can be bought at Sephora and can also be returned if you don't like it. Next I do my eye makeup and my base avoiding foundation on the under eye. Then add another light layer of the Shiseido eye cream. For concealer I mix Kulfi main match concealer in Rose rush with Charlotte tilbury beautiful skin concealer in shade 8 and blend it first with my fingers the a brush - then fingers again. It lays beautifully under the eyes. With all of those steps I am for the first time in my life able to use powder to set my eye concealer both over and under my eyes. ( I don't use the Sisley mask on my eyelids if I'm wearing makeup. Nighttime yes - but for eyeshadow I just use the Shiseido benefiance with concealer). Once the concealer is blended I immediately set with Huda easy bake loose powder. I use pound cake or pound cake mixed with the light peach. This combo lasts all day without cracking and scaling and it actually covers dark circles wellie making my wrinkles look less noticeable rather than worse as most concealers do. 3. Eyeshadow - I have to use a bright light colour on the lid. Then a light brown in the crease and a darker brown in the outer corner. I also use a highlighter in the inner corner and just on the very inner part of the lid. The one I use is no longer available but a close second is benefit tickle? I think. There are two shades cookie and tickle - the pink gold one is not good. There is a lighter shade that is described as being lighter and more silver which I normally wouldn't think is good for me. I initially purchased the pink gold one and that was a mistake. Sorry - I forgot which is which atm. The eyeshadow pallette that suits me best is the Charlotte Tilbury exagger eyes quad. The key with that is to use your finger or a dense bush to pick up the lighter lid shade and your finger to apply the sparkle shade just in the centre of your lid to the outer corner. You really need to work your finger into the sparkle shade to warm it up and then apply it....

1lh7fdk,2025-06-21 21:33:16,en,REDDIT,"  To elaborate, I'm 16 years old, and I have terrible hyperpigmentation where my smile lines are. I don't have fine lines there. Right now, I go to a dermatologist and use tretinoin to lighten it. I attached a picture of what I look like. I'm sorry if I look greasy or shiny; I just did my skincare and I don't have any filter on. Whenever I put makeup on that area it creases where I smile. I feel like if I don't put on a lot of product it's not covering up the marks but then it creases. It looks like I'm trying way too hard and I feel so insecure. It takes me three hours to get ready and it's so annoying. I feel like crying after because it looks so terrible. I know that having your makeup crease is normal but I don't think it should be that obvious the moment I put makeup on. My morning skincare routine: Oil cleanser, foam cleanser, toner, moisturizer, and lastly sunscreen. I have combination skin and I wait 5-10 minutes before applying makeup so everything soaks in. The order I apply my makeup products: Huda Beauty color corrector in shade Peach, Haus Labs concealer in shade 31, Charlotte Tilbury setting spray, and finally the Laura Mercier loose longwear setting powder in shade Honey. I use brushes from amazon to blend it out. Is there a special technique I'm supposed to do? Any advice would be extremely helpful. Thank you so much!!"

Our beauty team has curated a list of the top viral beauty trends that are not only buzzworthy but also totally wearable. Whether you're on the hunt for your new beauty staple or seeking some inspo for your next trip to the hair or nail salon, here's what's hot right now... READ MORE: Skincare guru Caroline Hirons on the two products every teen should use – and what to avoid READ MORE: 'I've tried dozens of foundations but this one always gets me compliments' 10 biggest beauty trends for summer 2025 Mocha bronde The Princess of Wales, Rita Ora and Lisa have all been sporting a mocha bronde hair colour recently (Image: Getty, Instagram @ritaora) Pantone's Colour of the Year, Mocha Mousse, is making waves in the hair world too, and mocha bronde is the it-shade for summer, according to hair stylist and trend guru Tom Smith. He describes it as ""monochromatic and muted"", reports the Mirror. At the salon, don't just ask for any brown – specify mushroom and coffee tones with no caramel highlights, says Tom. To maintain the colour, treat your locks bi-weekly with a blue or purple shampoo, like John Frieda Blue Crush Blue Conditioner, curerntly £6.89. Tubing mascara Tubing mascara might be the answer if you find your regular formula always smudges (Image: Too Faced, Revolution) Struggling with panda eyes in the summer heat, or while you swim? Make a switch to tubing mascara. Forget the messy smudges of old-school mascaras – these use polymers to wrap each lash in a smudge-free 'tube', offering length and a firm hold. The best part? They're a dream to remove. Just a bit of warm water and a gentle rub, and they'll slip right off, particularly great for those with sensitive eyes. Too Faced Ribbon Wrapped Lash Mascara , £28 – check out my full review of this mascara here Revolution Wrap Lash Tubing Mascara , currently priced at £7.99 (usual price £10.99) Popular Korean beauty brand Belif has just launched into the UK (Image: Marie Francesca Photography) Korean beauty isn't a new trend, but with the recent UK launch of popular K-beauty brands like Beauty of Joseon at Boots and Belif on Beauty Bay and Amazon, it's now easier than ever to give them a go. Korean formulas are renowned for their hydrating properties and dewy finish, yet they're incredibly lightweight, making them perfect for summer when slathering on heavy cream in hot weather might not be so appealing. SPF superstars Three of our favourite facial SPFs this summer (Image: Merit, Ultra Violette, Olay) Sunscreen is often viewed more as a necessity than a luxury, but facial SPF formulations have significantly improved – so there's really no reason not to wear it daily. Merit's The Uniform Tinted Mineral SPF 50, £34, launched with a waitlist of over 20,000, while beauty editors have been raving about Ultra Violette Future Fluid SPF 50+ Superlight Mineral Skinscreen, £38. Designed to be make-up-friendly, Olay Brighten and Glow Vitamin C Moisturising Fluid SPF 50+, £26, looks set to be the high street's top choice – and you can often find it on sale, too. Fruity fragrances Three gorgeous fruity fragrances to try this summer (Image: PHLUR, Ariana Grande, Jo Loves) Perfumes take their inspiration from fruits, with juicy concoctions creating dreamy scents. Try PHLUR Peach Skin Body Mist, from £25, Ariana Grande R.E. M. Cherry Eclipse Eau de Parfum, currently £36 (usual price £45), or Jo Loves With Love From Como, £135, with zesty notes of grapefruit and clementine. And look out for a lip-smacking new launch from Jo Malone London next month. Sunscreen oils Bali Body's new Watermelon Sunscreen Oil SPF 50 (Image: Bali Body) They're back – but with a big difference. Unlike the sometimes dangerously low (or even no) protection tanning oils of the past, Bali Body's new Watermelon Sunscreen Oil SPF 50, £22.95, comes with super-high broad spectrum sun protection for that gleaming-limb look without risking your skin. It smells incredible, too – like summer in a bottle. Neck care Two neck creams worth checking out (Image: Boost Lab, PRAI) In summer there's little chance to hide under high-neck jumpers, so if you're not already paying attention to the skin under your chin, you really should be, say the experts and – judging by all the new neck creams being launched and the interest we get from readers whenever we write about them – it's clearly an area worth paying attention to. Boost Lab's Edelweiss Neck Firming Serum, £24.99, is good value with impressive shopper results, while Prai Ageless Throat and Decolletage Creme, £31.99, continues to be the best-selling neck cream at M&S...."

Y es que, en plena era de los labios protagonistas, ya no hace falta pasar por el quirófano para lucir una boca carnosa y seductora. Aunque el ácido hialurónico ha sido el retoque estrella en los últimos años, cada vez son más las que prefieren realzar su sonrisa con cosméticos bien elegidos… y trucos de maquillaje que hacen magia. La tendencia es clara: labios más definidos, jugosos y con ese toque de volumen natural que eleva cualquier look. Para lograrlo, el mercado ofrece una auténtica constelación de productos… desde glosses que aportan brillo y efecto visual de grosor, hasta labiales con fórmulas estimulantes que hacen que los labios se hinchen levemente gracias a ingredientes picantes como la menta o la canela. Pero… ¿Sabías que existen famosas que apuestan por métodos mucho más sutiles (y económicos) para conseguir el mismo efecto? Una de ellas es Scarlett Johansson, y sus trucos están al alcance de todas. Artículo relacionado Los labios irresistibles y sin pinchazos de Scarlett Johansson: el secreto mejor guardado para una boca con volumen La icónica actriz de Nueva York se ha convertido en un referente absoluto en cuestiones de estilo y belleza. A sus 40 años, sigue manteniendo ese halo de sofisticación natural que tantas desean. ¿Su secreto? Saber potenciar lo mejor de sus rasgos sin caer en excesos ni complicadas rutinas. Sus labios, sin duda, son una de sus señas de identidad: carnosos, definidos y siempre bien cuidados. Y lo mejor es que su forma de maquillarlos combina hidratación, técnica y productos acertados. Su objetivo no es transformarlos, sino resaltar su forma natural y lograr ese efecto “segunda piel” que tanto favorece. Artículo relacionado Cómo conseguir labios con volumen sin rellenos Para Scarlett, cuidar los labios es tan esencial como aplicar una buena base de maquillaje. La actriz ha revelado en varias ocasiones que suele tener los labios secos cuando llega de golpe el verano o el invierno, por lo que opta por productos multifunción que nutren en profundidad y aportan, además, un toque de volumen. “Me encantan los bálsamos que hidratan, pero también dan ese efecto de labios llenos y brillantes, sin necesidad de rellenos”, confesó a Byrdie. Aplica este tipo de bálsamos como primer paso, antes del labial de color, y consigue una textura suave, flexible y lista para el maquillaje. El resultado será un look natural, jugoso y con ese acabado ""boca mordida"" que todas queremos. Artículo relacionado Efecto mordido: el truco chic para maquillar los labios Uno de los gestos más sutiles y eficaces de Scarlett es el conocido efecto mordido, una técnica que aprendió de su maquillador de confianza, Hung Vanngo. Se trata de aplicar un labial rojo suave solo en el centro de los labios y difuminarlo hacia fuera con los dedos o una esponjita. ¿El toque final? Un poquito del mismo tono de rubor en mejillas y nariz para lograr ese efecto monocromático que armoniza todo el rostro. Este juego de color crea una sensación óptica de volumen sin delineados marcados ni capas gruesas. Perfecto para el día a día o para una cita especial con cero esfuerzo. Exfoliar, el paso olvidado que transforma tus labios Uno de los errores más comunes es aplicar color sin preparar previamente la superficie. Scarlett lo tiene claro: labios bonitos son labios cuidados. Exfoliante labial delicado en barra de Kiko Milano/ AMAZON Por eso, antes de maquillarlos, realiza una suave exfoliación con un producto a base de azúcar que elimina pieles muertas y alisa la textura. Luego aplica bálsamo, retira el exceso con un pañuelo y procede al color. Un paso sencillo que marca la diferencia en el acabado. El delineador: tu mejor aliado para redefinir la boca Aunque sus labios son naturalmente definidos, Scarlett no renuncia al poder de un buen lápiz labial. Entre sus favoritos están Spice de MAC y Pillow Talk de Charlotte Tilbury, tonos neutros y versátiles que ayudan a perfilar con discreción, aportando estructura sin rigidez. Una barra de labios Pillow Talk/ charlottetilbury.com Ella los combina con Lip Oasis de The Outset —producto labial repulpante, del cual, por cierto, es imagen y embajadora— un tratamiento de labios con péptidos voluminizadores y agentes hidratantes que actúa como bálsamo y tratamiento a largo plazo. Un combo perfecto para quienes buscan belleza y cuidado en un solo gesto. Lip Oasis de The Outset/ CULTBEAUTY El truco luminoso de Scarlett Johansson, cómo usar el iluminador Un gesto que no falta en el ritual labial de Johansson es aplicar iluminador en el arco de Cupido. Esta técnica, muy utilizada por los maquilladores profesionales, acentúa la curva superior del labio y crea un efecto de mayor volumen visual gracias a la luz que reflejan los pigmentos. Ideal para equilibrar proporciones y destacar la zona sin necesidad de maquillaje excesivo. Otro truco viral (e inesperado) de Anne Hathaway volumen exprés..."

Shot by Erik Umphery in Decatur, Georgia, the Real Housewives of Atlanta star is radiant in a glam photo shoot inspired by the 1995 film Waiting to Exhale. The romantic comedy follows a group of four friends, Bernadine (Angela Bassett), Savannah (Whitney Houston), Robin (Lela Rochon) and Gloria (Loretta Devine). Styled by Jeremy Haynes, Williams takes her rightful place among these powerful and iconic women.

Steve Madden shoes. Fiery Jewelry. Haynes wanted to emulate the ""powerful"" style of the mid-'90s that's reflected in the film. ""I think everything comes back full circle,"" he explains.

The stylist fit Williams in menswear-inspired looks such as a pinstripe jumpsuit and structured white blazer which he balanced with more feminine styles like a figure-hugging, floral-print dress. A standout piece, says Haynes, is the full Dolce & Gabbana ensemble Williams wears for the shoot's car scene.

Pristine Jewelry. Switching from look to look is no easy feat, and Carlos says that ""prep was key"" to making sure the transitions ran smoothly. ""I prepped and styled all the wigs the night before, so everything was ready to go,"" he recalls. ""Also, a thorough consultation with Porsha before the shoot also worked wonders. It helped me get a clear sense of her vision so I could show up fully prepared and aligned with the creative direction."" Williams' stunning styles were achieved with the help of Kenra and ORS Hair Care products. for styling and finishing. ""Everything was locked in place with my signature product, The Dose Lace Spray — which is launching soon!"" says Carlos.

Before starting on the glam, Williams' skin was prepped using the Almay Moisturizing Makeup Remover Cleanser, as well as Meaningful Beauty Youth Activating Melon Serum, Charlotte Tilbury Magic Serum and Magic Cream. (Williams is an Almay spokesperson.)

Shot by Erik Umphery in Decatur, Georgia, the Real Housewives of Atlanta star is radiant in a glam photo shoot inspired by the 1995 film Waiting to Exhale. The romantic comedy follows a group of four friends, Bernadine (Angela Bassett), Savannah (Whitney Houston), Robin (Lela Rochon) and Gloria (Loretta Devine). Styled by , Williams takes her rightful place among these powerful and iconic women. ""Porsha and Bernie's character have a lot of similarities,"" Haynes tells PEOPLE about the shoot's concept.

The stylist fit Williams in menswear-inspired looks such as a pinstripe jumpsuit and structured white blazer which he balanced with more feminine styles like a figure-hugging, floral-print dress. A standout piece, says Haynes, is the full Dolce & Gabbana ensemble Williams wears for the shoot's car scene.

Pristine Jewelry. Switching from look to look is no easy feat, and Carlos says that ""prep was key"" to making sure the transitions ran smoothly. ""I prepped and styled all the wigs the night before, so everything was ready to go,"" he recalls. ""Also, a thorough consultation with Porsha before the shoot also worked wonders. It helped me get a clear sense of her vision so I could show up fully prepared and aligned with the creative direction."" Williams' stunning styles were achieved with the help of Kenra and ORS Hair Care products. for styling and finishing. ""Everything was locked in place with my signature product, The Dose Lace Spray — which is launching soon!"" says Carlos.

Why trust us? From dry shampoo to SPF and cordless hair tools, don't forget these little luxuries Whether you're packing for Glastonbury this week (lucky you), heading Reading & Leeds for the first time or getting ready for Latitude, festival season is here – and when it comes to packing, preperation is key. As well as non-negotiable essentials like tents, sleeping bags, SPF and camping chairs, your checklist shouldn't neglect the little luxuries that can make camping in a field for four days slightly more bearable (hello air beds, your favourite pillow, earplugs or Hunter wellington boots à la Kate Moss and Alexa Chung). While the less high maintenance among us might get by with just a toothbrush and baby wipes (no judgement here), others require a little more TLC in the camping field – myself included. From cordless hair tools and dry shampoo to give some oomph to three-day old locks, to instant tan or tinted SPF's for coverage and UV protection, plenty of products made my time at Glastonbury two years in a row a whole lot smoother (particularly when you're limited to shared showers and portaloos with no privacy). To help ensure you don't forget anything, I've rounded up the beauty essentials you need for your next festival (after all, we can't all glamp in a luxury bell tent with the A-listers). Garnier mighty micellar bundle: £10, Boots.com Your usual skincare regime will likely be neglected while your camping in a festival field. Streamline your routine to just Garnier's miscellar water for removing make-up and cleansing. Complete with reusable eco pads, the gentle formula cleanses skin without stripping it of moisture. A festival make-up bag hero. While a cordless hair tool may not be deemed an “essential”, it can certainly make the experience a lot nicer. Adding texture and life back into three-day old hair, BaByliss's cordless waving tool creates soft, loose waves for an effortlessly tousled look (even if you haven't showered in a while). Charlotte Tilbury's airbrush setting spray is a cult classic for good reason. Keeping make-up in place for up to 16 hours, you can apply in the morning and still look fresh in the dance tent at 2am. The water-like formula is packed with skin-loving ingredients (think aloe vera, hydrating Japanese green tea and resin) to prevent clogged pores and avoid your make-up settling into fine lines. You're sure to appreciate the fresh, floral fragrance on day three in the field, too. CeraVe AM facial moisturizing lotion SPF50: £13.20, Amazon.co.uk One of our favourite face SPFs for 2025, CeraVe's facial moisturising lotion ticks every box. The consistency is more like a traditional moisturiser, though it isn't sticky or greasy on skin. “You're left with is a healthy-looking glow, and I love how make-up wears on top of this formula, and the finish of it means it makes a great primer,” our beauty reviewer said. “Plus, like all CeraVe products, it's bolstered with hardworking ingredients that nourish, protect and hydrate your skin.” A non-negotiable for festival season that saves you packing both a moisturiser and SPF. Living Proof perfect hair day dry shampoo: £18.70, Amazon.co.uk No festival beauty haul is complete without dry shampoo. Unlike other formulas, Living Proof's dry shampoo actually cleans hair while eliminating oil, sweat and odor (perfect for camping in a field). Freshening up your tresses between washes thanks to the brand's triple-action cleaning technology, it releases a fragrance that lingers throughout the day. Hawaiian Tropic hydrating protection sunscreen lotion SPF50: £6.80, Amazon.co.uk Whether it's a day event or camping affair, you're far more exposed to the sun at a festival than your usual day-to-day, making a body SPF an essential. Offering 12 hours of hydration, Hawaiian Tropic's body SPF is powered by cocoa and shea butter. “It's not sticky or greasy; it sinks in quickly and leaves the skin feeling supple and nourished,” our beauty expert said in their review. At less than £10, the dual purpose formula is pleasingly affordable, protecting your skin from UV's rays during a long day dancing in the sun. Pampers sensitive skin baby wipes: £1.25, Boots.com If you need a quick wipe down and freshen up, then baby wipes are a handy addition to your festival arsenal (especially if the showers aren't up to scratch). This Pampers pack promises to nourish, soften and hydrate skin. Plus, there's 52 wipes inside meaning you can easily share a pack among friends. Burning your lips is never fun, particularly at a festival. Enter Ultrasun's ultralip balm. The SPF30 formula is designed specifically to protect your lips from UV rays while moisturising any dryness. Fragrance free and sheer, it can be used over lipstick or gloss and topped up throughout the day. Whether you're post-port aloo or mid-set at the main stage, a hand sanitiser is an essential in your bum bag. Keep bacteria away and maintaining a feeling of freshness, Haan's range of hand sanitisers are perfect for on-the-go use thanks to the compact spritz design. In fact, our reviewer said: “The award for most innovative hand sanitiser has to go to HAAN, whose flat pocket-friendly sprays make application cool, easy and even a little fun.” Finalise your festival packing list with our ultimate checking list"

mzlgtfz,2025-06-24 22:31:15,en,REDDIT,"  Moisturizing helps a lot. Different products work for different people, but neutrogena hydro boost face wash works for mine and I also use a sulfur+salicylic acid soap by Revitale on Amazon that helps as well. I use it on my body and face. I'll spray my legs with TendSkin and use the CeraVe rough and bumpy cream on them too and it seems to help if I leave them alone. I had some luck with a bar of kojic acid soap before I relapsed. These all take about 3wks for me to see real improvement but they help so much. For skincare I use the Cosrx snail mucin serum and I swear by the Charlotte Tilbury magic cream. Rosehip and sea buckthorn oil also do wonders for dark spots and speed up healing. While I'm waiting for my legs to heal I've been wearing tights under shorts or cute light material leg warmers to hide most of the damage with fashion lol."
mov_731D53256E116EF1FE3FD2E52792F243,2025-06-25 07:44:30,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Mascaras versprechen den perfekten Augenaufschlag. Imtest hat beliebte Wimperntuschen genauer unter die Lupe genommen. Das Ergebnis überrascht: Der Testsieger erregt Aufsehen, eine günstige Drogerie-Mascara überzeugt mit starker Leistung. Ein Augenaufschlag wie auf dem roten Teppich – dafür braucht es entweder falsche Wimpern oder eine starke Mascara. Auch einige Männer setzen laut Social Media zunehmend auf das Wimpern-Upgrade. Mascara verleiht Ausdruck, färbt, verdichtet und lässt die Wimpern länger wirken. Imtest hat verschiedene Produkte getestet – mit einem überraschendem Ergebnis. Charlotte Tilbury gewinnt den Mascara-Test An die Spitze der besten Mascaras schafft es bei Imtest die teuerste Wimperntusche im Test: Die ""Legendary Lashes Volume 2"" von Charlotte Tilbury überzeugt mit ihrer einfachen und schmierfreien Anwendung und bekommt dafür die Note 1,7 (gut). In puncto Volumen, Länge und leichtes Auftragen schnitt die Mascara am besten ab. Die Wimpern wirken lang, voluminös, dichter und sehen nicht aus wie Fliegenbeine. Das Make-up deckt hervorragend und verwischt selbst bei Regen nicht. Farbe: Schwarz Inhalt: acht Milliliter Wasserfest: ja Die starke Farbintensität lässt das Augen-Make-up laut der Tester jedoch schnell unnatürlich wirken. Für alle, die einen dezenten Look bevorzugen, ist die Designer-Mascara daher weniger geeignet. Wer hingegen den glamourösen Kim-Kardashian-Style oder echten Hollywood-Flair sucht, liegt mit diesem Produkt richtig. Ein Haken: Die ""Legendary Lashes Volume 2"" kostet satte 34 Euro – bei nur acht Millilitern Inhalt. Hinweis: Die Preise sind volatil und die Händler passen bisweilen auch die unverbindliche Preisempfehlung (UVP) an. Sollten sich die Preise von den hier angegebenen unterscheiden, haben die Händler sie nach Veröffentlichung des Artikels geändert. Testsieger mit Schadstoffen – wie schädlich ist Formaldehyd? Trotz Testsieg steht Charlotte Tilbury in der Kritik: Imtest entdeckt in der Mascara Spuren von Formaldehyd – ein Stoff, der in hohen Mengen als potenziell krebserregend gilt, in kleinen Mengen die Schleimhäute reizen kann. Damit ist die teure Wimperntusche nicht allein: Auch ein Produkt von Max Factor enthält den Stoff und landet – nicht nur deshalb – auf dem letzten Platz im Test. Drogerie-Mascara von Essence holt sich den Preis-Leistungs-Sieg Der Testsieg von Charlotte Tilbury wirft Fragen auf: Muss gute Mascara teuer sein? Imtest verneint – auch L'Oréal Paris und Essence überzeugen, ganz ohne Formaldehyd. Die ""I Love Extreme Crazy Volume""-Mascara liefert zwar weniger Volumen und Schwung als das Luxusprodukt, schenkt aber dennoch einen glamourösen Look. Endnote: 2,1 (gut). Farbe: Schwarz Inhalt: zwölf Milliliter Wasserfest: nein Essence ""I Love Extreme Crazy Volume""-Mascara 2,39 € (199,17 € / l) 2,99 € (249,17 € / l) Zum Angebot bei amazon.de Trotzdem: Zu Beginn kommt sehr viel Produkt mit, und die Wimpern verkleben schnell, wenn man beim Auftragen nicht aufpasst. Den Regentest überlebt sie ebenfalls nicht so gut. Dafür punktet aber ihr günstiger Preis: Die Mascara von Essence gibt es bereits für 2,39 Euro online und in Drogerien. Für das Geld ist die Wimperntusche dann doch eine fabelhafte Alternative zur hochpreisigen Mascara von Charlotte Tilbury. Das Drogerieprodukt für ein paar Taler kommt mit dem dritten Platz im Test relativ nah an den Testsieger heran – damit ist Essence klarer Preis-Leistungs-Gewinner. Bei der Stiftung Warentest landet die Mascara im Mittelfeld. Der Test zeigte erstaunlicherweise, dass das Drogerie-Produkt sogar um Haaresbreite mit einer High-End-Mascara von Dior mithalten konnte. Air Volume Mega Mascara von L'Oreal Paris: Was hat die preisliche Mittelklasse zu bieten? Die Air Volume Mega Mascara von L'Oréal Paris punktet im Test mit ihrem sichtbaren Volumen- und Längen-Effekt. Positiv fällt auf: Die Tusche lässt sich leicht verteilen, verklebt kaum und hält auch im Alltag zuverlässig. Zwar reicht sie in Sachen Schwung und Glamour nicht ganz an den Testsieger heran, doch mit solider Performance und ohne bedenkliche Stoffe landet sie verdient auf einem der oberen Plätze – eine verlässliche Wahl aus der Mittelklasse. Auch bei Stiftung Warentest wird die Wimperntusche gelobt und bekommt eine Bewertung von 2,4 (gut). Farbe: Schwarz Inhalt: 9,4 Milliliter Wasserfest: nein L'Oréal Paris ""Air Volume Mega""-Mascara 10,59 € (10.590,00 € / l) 14,99 € (14.990,00 € / l) Zum Angebot bei amazon.de Vor Regen oder Tränen sollten die Wimpern mit der Air Volume Mega Mascara jedoch geschützt werden, denn im Test verschmierte sie im Regentest...."

mov_EF653D116166B725FB342FA7668C56EC,2025-06-25 10:21:01,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Carlos Martorell nació en Barcelona en diciembre de 1944 en el seno de una familia de la sociedad barcelonesa. Desde muy joven destacó por su personalidad muy especial, irrepetible, unas veces arrebatadora y otras difícil, pero encantadora como la de los genios. Si he conocido a una persona entregada a servir a los demás para que disfruten ése es Carlos, capaz de conseguir que lo más difícil parezca fácil. Antes de seguir, solicito humildemente un homenaje público del Govern balear, en el que sus amigos podamos darle las gracias por todo lo que nos ha hecho vivir y disfrutar sin pedir jamás nada a cambio. La carrera profesional que eligió Carlos se aleja bastante de la que a priori se esperaba de él. Estudió Derecho en la Universidad de Barcelona. Comenzó su carrera de relaciones públicas a los 18 años organizando los momentos recreativos de los congresos internacionales de medicina, siendo su padre presidente de la Sociedad Internacional de Cirugía Cardiovascular. Es colegiado fundador del Col·legi de Publicitaris i Relacions Públiques de Catalunya. Impartió clases en la Universitat Internacional de Catalunya. En Carlos nada ha sido un regalo, al contrario, todo ese mundo que nos hubiese gustado vivir fue la consecuencia de un esfuerzo sobrehumano que, como pasa siempre en España, pocos saben entender y valorar. Ya es hora de que les demos las gracias a los que nos han hecho la vida bonita. Los que no lo conocen fliparán cuando les hable de sus logros y hazañas. Empiecen a flipar como si estuviesen en una de esas fiestas alucinógenas que creó Carlos. En 1963 fue a conocer la isla de Ibiza, entonces virgen y pobre. Se enamoró y abandonó su carrera de Derecho, en el quinto curso, para instalarse a vivir en la Ibiza hippy, en 1968. Y habló tanto de Ibiza que ese año Oriol Regás, propietario de la discoteca Bocaccio de Barcelona, le encargó que organizase un viaje para que unos 110 clientes de la discoteca pasasen tres días divertidos en la aún desconocida Ibiza. Volaron en un avión alquilado de Spantax, ocuparon todo el Hotel Montesol y bailaron todas las noches en la muy pequeña discoteca Lola's, donde Carlos había organizado la Noche de Blanco. La expedición tuvo mucho éxito y fue la primera vez que la prensa española publicó titulares como «Fiesta en Ibiza». Inconscientemente había plantado la semilla del exitoso ocio nocturno. En 1969 le enseñó la isla a Ricardo Urgell, que decidió abrir el Pacha de Ibiza. Y Carlos le ayudó a organizar la fiesta de apertura. Y, desde entonces, Carlos no paró de colaborar con Pacha, llevando a bailar incluso a miembros de la realeza como los Reyes de Bulgaria, la Princesa María Gabriela de Saboya, el Conde de Barcelona, padre del Rey Juan Carlos, la Infanta Elena, miembros de la familia de Raniero de Mónaco y muchos famosos nacionales e internacionales. Más adelante organizó las aperturas de las discotecas Amnesia, Charly Max y KU (hoy Unvers). Para la apertura de Amnesia fue a Nueva York a comprar los discos de vinilo. Y su invitada principal fue la actriz Ursula Andress. Para la apertura de KU tuvo una idea premonitoria y ecológica. Organizó el Funeral por el Mediterráneo llenando con cientos de botellas de plástico la gran piscina. Y todos los invitados iban en procesión, alrededor de las aguas, con velones en las manos, vestidos de luto obligatorio, con el Réquiem de Mozart. Carlos habla cinco idiomas y ha sido modelo de publicidad para White Horse y Desigual. En 1971 compró un triplex en Dalt Vila, que filmé para mi programa House & Style. Y alquiló una casa sin electricidad, en Sant Carles, donde pasó 35 mágicos veranos. En 1972 viajó a Nueva York y, desde entonces, pasó 17 otoños seguidos en la gran ciudad. Allí trabajó como periodista fotografiando y entrevistando a personajes muy famosos como Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger, Grace Jones, Halston, Elsa Peretti, Paloma Picasso y Liza Minelli, entre otros. Hace periodismo y colabora con el Diario de Ibiza, el Periódico de Ibiza y la revista Ibiza Live Report. Y desde hace cinco años cuenta todos los jueves las Historias de Carlos Martorell en Onda Cero Ibiza y Formentera. Durante un tiempo trabajó para la introducción del arquitecto Ricardo Bofill en París. Y es asesor de prensa del arquitecto José Ribas. Hay relaciones públicas modernos e influencers que no saben quién es esta leyenda viva que inventó una forma de trabajar para ellos. Javier Escobar y otros aprendieron mucho de su maestro. Carlos reclama su lugar en este mundo donde cabezas infantiles ganan fortunas. Ha escrito dos novelas Réquiem por Peter Pan en Ibiza (traducida en inglés en digital) y La memoria enjaulada, sobre el Alzheimer. Ambas en venta en Amazon. Y publicó el libro El Baile de Pacha, que es una joya, con Toni Riera. El Consulting de Carlos Martorell se ha ocupado de la organización de eventos, promoción y divulgación de marcas. Y entre sus clientes están Dior, Loewe, Armani, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein, Etro, Chopard, relojes Chanel, Polo Ralph Lauren, Mango, Swatch, Cartier, Tiffany, Rabat, Virgin Galactic, Charlotte Tilbury y Bru&Bru. Otra de sus especialidades es la promoción de restaurantes y hoteles, como el Montesol, Ibiza Gran Hotel, Standard Hotel y el agroturismo Atzaró, donde colaboró para las fiestas de Mango de Penélope Cruz y su hermana Mónica, y del perfume Lady Rebel. Además, ha hecho varias exposiciones de sus fotos de la India y Haití. Y ha decorado restaurantes y varias casas particulares. Su gusto estético, en cualquier ámbito, es fabuloso. Una clase auténtica sin coches de lujo ni brillantes en las orejas...."

It's about feeling in control, however dispiriting the conditions. I don't mean smart as in Sunday best. It's not 1963. And I don't mean something you can go straight to a boardroom meeting in, either. It's not 1993. I'm talking about simple tricks to look sleek. Coordinating colours (that includes shoes or trainers), strong contrasts (stripes, checks, simple graphic prints), some unfussy silver or gold jewellery for a finished look (nothing pricey, it's easily lost on-board), fabrics that look considered rather than just grabbed from your gym bag, and a tailored element you can pop on when you've arrived. If those boxes are ticked, most of the outfit can be a blend of casual stretchy and loose. A simple 100 per cent organic cotton T-shirt is a good start (try navygrey.co), or something with an integral, non-wired bra that still offers support (M&S has options). Athletics brands such as Vuori, Sweaty Betty and Alo Yoga have all branched into a category I'll call travel trousers, which are game-changers (yes, if you're flying business they'll give you PJs but they're generally nylon, which might be fine on your legs but not round your armpits). I wore these Lululemons on a 23-hour flight to Sydney recently (including a three-hour stopover in Doha, where the Four Seasons-quality showers make all the difference). Lululemon also sells pleat fronts with stretchy waistbands. They're all as synthetic as Hollywood plastic surgery, but easy to wash, although mine have faded a bit. High Sport, the OG of stretch trousers, has super- stylish cotton kick flares… for £680. Alternatively, Baujken's jogger-meets-smart in sustainable, Ecovero and Lenzing, worn with a blazer and the right shoes, would work for our smart-vibes matrix. Cotton knits are cooler than wool and more straightforward to wash. Cardigans are easier to take on and off: for extra smartness, make it a cardigan jacket. If you're partial to a soft scarf (every micro luxury helps), Cornelia James's ultra-lightweight, 6ft- long shawls are heaven – and take up almost no space. Speaking of which, a tote with a separate compartment for your laptop or iPad is ideal to safeguard it from liquids. Aspinal's London Tote has the internals just right. I pop my scarf, Kindle plus charger and potions in separate pouches in it so that I can keep essentials next to me without having to disturb my neighbour constantly by reaching into the overhead locker. Stow London has excellent clear travel accessories – pricey but durable. Skincare supremo Keren Bartov recommends plenty of massaging with facial oil and repeat applications of moisturiser and hyaluronic acid, particularly on your neck. And SPF. Those rays at 35,000 feet are real. And boring as it is, drinking a minimum of 1.5 litres while on an eight-hour flight is transformative. Take your gua sha stone with you and use it for instant depuffing. No one will bat an eye at your on-board spa session, possibly because they're wearing a sheet mask. Final touch as you land? A swipe of bright lipstick or whatever your one desert island cosmetic is: previous 24 hours erased. Your in-flight wardrobe...

The actor, 64, and the human rights activist lawyer, 47, attended The King's Trust and TKMaxx & Homesense Awards in London, on Thursday, June 26. For the occasion, the Wolfs actor kept his look classic and wore a navy blue suit with matching slacks. The star completed the outfit with a white button down shirt — worn with a few buttons undone for a casual vibe — black dress shoes and black aviator sunglasses. The star's hair was also back to its signature silver fox gray, which returned following the completion of his run on Broadway for Good Night, and Good Luck. Nicky J Sims/Getty George Clooney (left) and Amal Clooney attend The King's Trust and TKMaxx & Homesense Awards 2025 at The Royal Festival Hall on June 26, 2025 in London, England. Amal wore a simple dress for her and George's date night — the activist attended the event in a bright white column gown with an oversized metal piece that formed a halter top around her neck. The dress also featured a thigh-high slit on each side of the dress to allow ease of movement.

Prior to their London outings, George and Amal attended the 2025 Tony Awards on June 8 and channeled old Hollywood glamour for the event. The actor, who was nominated for best actor in a play for Good Night, and Good Luck, wore a black tuxedo with a matching black bowtie.

The ER actor added that Amal would ""be glad when it's gone,” because the color made him look “like [I'm] going through some horrible midlife crisis. I'm 64 — midlife is a little stretch."""

The dress also featured a thigh-high slit on each side of the dress to allow ease of movement.

Prior to their London outings, George and Amal attended the 2025 Tony Awards on June 8 and channeled old Hollywood glamour for the event. The actor, who was nominated for best actor in a play for Good Night, and Good Luck, wore a black tuxedo with a matching black bowtie. Amal embraced another fitted silhouette, but wore an off the shoulder gown covered in pearls.

The ER actor added that Amal would ""be glad when it's gone,” because the color made him look “like [I'm] going through some horrible midlife crisis. I'm 64 — midlife is a little stretch.""

Terez & Honor eyelash serum to help grow those lashes to new heights! Just apply this along the lash line every night to help give you the natural falsies look. Plus, this works on your eyebrows as well! No lash serum will work overnight, but with consistent use, you'll be able to see longer and fuller looking lashes! Promising review: ""I've always been skeptical of lash serums like this, but the reviews were great, so I decided to try it. After using for a few weeks, I noticed that my eyelashes had grown to the point that they touched my eyebrows! I honestly didn't think this was going to work, but was pleasantly surprised when it did. It works great to grow out your eyebrows as well!"" —Erin Get it from Amazon for $22.49. 2. L'Oréal Paris Elvive 8 Second Wonder Water for those of you who don't have the time *or* the money to be sitting in a salon chair all day but still want some luscious-looking locks. Leave this lamellar water treatment in for 8 seconds, yes... 8 seconds only, and rinse out for silkier, shinier, healthier-looking hair. Promising review: ""I don't usually do reviews on products, but for this one I absolutely have to. I have 3c type hair and struggle with a lot a breakage, unmanageability, and moisture. When my mom mentioned this product to me, I didn't take her seriously because of the simple fact that we have two completely different hair textures. I never would have thought this brand would work on my hair ... I have never in my 22 years felt my hair like this. I feel like I have a completely different head of hair. This product is so amazing and I will FOREVER be using this product in my hair regimen."" —Theressa Hailey Get it from Amazon for $10.97. 3. An Anua pore-clearing cleansing oil that'll visibly remove any makeup, sunscreen, or excess sebum from your long day. This K-beauty product (formulated with soothing heartleaf extract) is perfect for anyone looking to double cleanse, and it'll glide on your face so smoothly. Promising review: ""My skin is *super* sensitive, but as I've aged (44 years), I feel like my pores have become more visible. I hadn't used an oil cleanser before and wasn't 100% sure how it should all work. The Anua oil cleanser works how we all once hoped Biore pore strips would work back in the day but without any pain or irritation. My skin is combination skin, so I have to be really careful about not drying out the dry spots (and getting eczema) and not over-hydrating the oily spots (and getting a breakout). I rub the oil on my face as the first part of my cleansing routine; I massage it in for ~60 seconds and then put a small amount of water on my fingers and begin rubbing that on my face. The water starts the emulsification process and helps to clean out everything the oil has bonded to/mixed with. Then, I just rinse it clean and use a gentle cleanser afterward. I haven't had any irritation, redness, or fallout from adding this product to my skincare routine. I love it. I am almost through my first bottle and if I go a few days without using the cleanser, my pores become more visible/dirty again. I will definitely keep purchasing the Anua oil cleanser."" —Tassa Get it from Amazon for $17.69. 4. A waterproof eyeliner stamp if you know all too well the struggle of making the left eyeliner match the right eyeliner only to find that you went overboard and turned yourself into a raccoon. Thanks to this, all you need to do is stamp the wing on the outer corner of your eye and flip it over to the fine tip to finish off the job! Promising review: ""This eyeliner is worth the buy, do it now!!! It is very easy to apply and once it is on, it stays in place unless you wipe it off. I love, love, love this eyeliner. —Catrinna F. The Flick Stick comes from New Zealand-based brand and small biz Lovoir Beauty. Get it from Amazon for $14.98 (available in three sizes and a combo pack). 5. A cruelty-free extreme hold eyebrow gel, a nonsticky formula that's literally called ""The Brow Glue"" — and for good reason because it holds for up to 16 hours!..."
mov_F64D4409A3150497C15809C5F54F13F7,2025-06-27 10:24:35,en,WEB,"  The global Makeup Market is rapidly transforming, not just in terms of products but in how consumers interact with them. Augmented reality (AR) and virtual try-on technologies are revolutionizing the way shoppers discover, test, and purchase makeup. These innovations have become key differentiators for beauty brands, creating immersive, personalized, and convenient experiences that bridge the gap between physical and digital retail. As consumer behavior shifts toward e-commerce and contactless engagement, AR-powered tools are reshaping the beauty retail landscape—offering users the ability to try on lipstick, foundation, eyeliner, and more with just a smartphone camera or webcam. What was once a novelty is now a necessity for forward-thinking makeup brands and retailers. A New Era of Virtual Beauty The beauty industry thrives on visual impact, and AR has proven to be a perfect fit. With virtual try-on (VTO) solutions, consumers can see how a makeup product looks on their face in real-time, without ever opening a tube or swatching a palette. This technology uses facial mapping and machine learning algorithms to detect skin tone, facial features, and lighting conditions, delivering a surprisingly realistic application. These tools are especially helpful when shopping online, where the lack of physical interaction traditionally hindered cosmetic purchases. Now, consumers can experiment with dozens of shades and styles, try different combinations, and make confident decisions—all from their smartphones. According to a recent study by Perfect Corp, a leading AR beauty tech company, brands that integrated VTO technology saw a 200% increase in conversion rates and a 30% decrease in product return rates. Clearly, this innovation is not just about novelty—it's driving measurable results. E-Commerce Integration and Consumer Empowerment As e-commerce continues to grow, AR and VTO tools are becoming essential components of online beauty retail. Major platforms like Sephora, Ulta, Amazon, and Nykaa have embraced AR solutions, integrating them into product pages to enhance user experience. Consumers can now try on multiple products in one session, compare shades, and receive personalized recommendations based on their preferences and skin tone. This interactivity empowers consumers, especially younger, tech-savvy shoppers who expect engaging, personalized shopping experiences. It also fosters inclusivity by allowing users of all skin tones, face shapes, and ages to visualize products tailored to their unique features—addressing a long-standing issue in the beauty industry. Additionally, AR tools eliminate the hygiene concerns of traditional in-store testers, a concern that has grown since the COVID-19 pandemic. With safety and convenience top of mind, virtual try-ons provide a seamless and sanitary alternative that enhances brand trust and consumer satisfaction. The Role of AI and Personalization Augmented reality in the makeup market is increasingly being paired with artificial intelligence (AI) to offer hyper-personalized beauty experiences. AI analyzes user data—such as facial structure, skin tone, and past preferences—to generate curated product suggestions and customized beauty routines. For instance, AI-powered tools can recommend the ideal foundation shade, suggest complementary lip colors, or create full makeup looks based on current trends. Some platforms even allow users to upload photos for detailed skin analysis, identifying concerns like redness, pigmentation, or dryness, and pairing them with suitable products. This level of personalization not only enhances the shopping experience but also strengthens brand loyalty. Consumers are more likely to return to a platform or brand that understands their needs and delivers relevant solutions. Bridging Online and Offline: The Omnichannel Advantage AR isn't limited to online channels. Forward-thinking retailers are bringing the same technology into physical stores to enhance the in-person shopping experience. Interactive mirrors, smart kiosks, and AR-enabled screens allow customers to try on products without touching them—adding a futuristic, fun, and contactless dimension to brick-and-mortar retail. For example, L'Oréal's ModiFace platform has been deployed both online and in stores, allowing users to virtually apply lipstick, blush, and eyeshadow with a high degree of accuracy. Charlotte Tilbury and MAC Cosmetics have also implemented smart mirrors in flagship locations to attract foot traffic and increase engagement. This omnichannel approach ensures consistency across all touchpoints, offering customers a seamless transition from digital exploration to physical purchase—or vice versa. Boosting Engagement on Social Media Social media platforms are also integrating AR technology, giving brands new ways to engage audiences. Instagram and Snapchat filters allow users to try on makeup in-app and share their looks with followers, driving organic reach and user-generated content. TikTok, already a beauty trend hub, is testing AR features that enable branded try-on experiences within videos. Such integrations blur the lines between entertainment and shopping, turning product discovery into a viral, shareable activity. Influencers and content creators can demonstrate virtual try-ons in real-time, expanding reach and building credibility through interactive storytelling. Challenges and Future Potential While AR and VTO tools are revolutionizing the makeup market, challenges remain. Ensuring color accuracy across different devices and lighting conditions is still a technical hurdle. Additionally, some users express concerns about data privacy and facial recognition technologies, urging brands to implement strong ethical practices. However, the future of AR in beauty is promising. Advancements in 3D rendering, real-time facial tracking, and haptic feedback could eventually lead to even more immersive experiences. Brands may soon offer fully virtual makeup tutorials, avatar-based consultations, and live AR beauty shows. Conclusion As the makeup market evolves, augmented reality and virtual try-on tools are becoming essential to meet the expectations of modern consumers...."

Learn more Jones Road knows a thing or two about no-makeup makeup and its new Just Enough Tinted Moisturiser has arrived in time for hot summer days. The formula is said to be light and breathable but also provides coverage wherever needed, perfect for covering blemishes. Designed to use as a last step of skincare, the moisturiser is available in 16 shades catering to pink, neutral, yellow, red and golden undertones. Shoppers have been heaping praise on the product, with one 85-year-old saying it made her realise: ""I do not need a heavy foundation."" The non-comedogenic formula includes Sodium Hyaluronate, a great humectant that is smaller in size than hyaluronic acid, which helps restore suppleness and improve the appearance of dry skin. It also protects skin's moisture barrier from water loss.

It really is Just Enough."" For a more accurate shade match, shoppers can try Charlotte Tilbury's Unreal Skin Sheer Glow Tint Hydrating Foundation Stick, £35, which comes in 20 shades.

I delved deeper and data shows a more nuanced story. Turns out, Pricing is not Sephora's main struggle ! Some key highlights on the data - The share of beauty and personal care sales taking place online in the US, increased from 35% in 2023 to 39% in 2024. - Amazon's share in beauty and personal care e-commerce increased to 47% from 44% during this period. - Sephora, the second-largest online retailer for beauty and personal care in the US, experienced a slight market share dip from 10% in 2023 to 9% in 2024 despite growing value sales. - Color Cosmetics and Skin care collectively form nearly 70% of Sephora's online sales in the US, both categories experienced a decline in online sales. - Most top-performing brands in colour cosmetics, including Charlotte Tilbury, Rare Beauty, and Sephora, had higher average prices at Amazon compared to Sephora in 2024. Despite lower prices, these brands experienced sales declines on Sephora. - Charlotte Tilbury, continues to decline across both retailers. - In skin care, most brands posted growth on Amazon in 2024 despite higher average prices. While Laneíge, Sol de Janereiro, Claudalie and Tower 28 saw lower prices on Amazon, these brands performed well across both retailers, with higher share of sales made via Sephora online. ➖ Source: Euromonitor International Read on to know what really should matter more for Sephora and its peer retailers in today's e-commerce landscape : http://bit.ly/3TNr8U7 #brandstrategy #ecommerce #sephora #amazon Fortune #digital #beauty Huda Beauty Rare Beauty NARS Cosmetics TATCHA  Charlotte Tilbury Beauty"

53250758ddb4979f89fffaaa34e2ada2,2025-07-02 00:01:00,en,WEB,"  1. An absolutely genius device called a ""Supoon"" — this perfectly sized spoon not only helps you scrape every last bit of food from the container (think: peanut butter, yogurt, cream cheese, etc.) but also has a unique design that keeps it away from the countertop when you set it down! This is about to prevent SO many ""babe, stop leaving your peanut butter spoon on the counter"" arguments. Natalie Brown / BuzzFeed ""When I impulse-bought this mini spatula (called a ""supoon"") at the grocery store a few years ago, I knew it was good, but not THIS good. See that little dip in the neck? That means you can set it down on the counter and whatever's on it won't end up touching said counter. Here's a few of the many things I use this dishwasher-safe beauty for — and yep, it makes it into basically every dishwasher load, I use it THAT frequently. - Scraping every last bit of sauce, curry, salad dressing, or soup out of takeout or leftover containers, like in the picture above. This happens several times a week. I want every bit of all that flavor!! - Measuring out a few teaspoons of water when re-steaming takeout rice in the microwave. - Scraping out yogurt, hummus, salsa, hot sauce, peanut butter, expensive Bonne Maman jams, etc., etc., when I'm down to the last little bit of each. (It's too big for most beauty products, but that's fine.) - Mixing together a quick stir-fry sauce in a measuring cup, then scraping that sauce out of the cup into the pan, all with a single utensil. - Scrambling together a mixture of eggs and whatever else I want in a bowl and scraping all of that into a pan. - Scooping pancake batter my MIL sent over into a pan to make my 9-month-old fresh pancakes, including scraping the last bits out to get as much pancake as possible. Like, I know I functioned in the kitchen before I had this, but this saves me so much time scraping over and over with a spoon. And that price! A no-brainer. "" — Natalie Brown Get it from Amazon for $6.99 , and find more sizes and colors on the Dreamfarm Amazon Store Page . 2. Miss Mouth's Messy Eater Stain Treater Spray , which is so effective that you'll remain suspiciously calm the next time your tot's chocolate milk makes its way from their sippy cup to the couch cushion. Or when your glass of merlot faces a similar fate. Just spray, blot, rinse, and pour another. Heather Braga/BuzzFeed "" My 1-year-old is a big ice pop fan, so I've got a long life ahead of me to be filled with stain removal. In the above photo I held her while she sucked down a red ice pop on a 90 degree day. Naturally, it dripped all over my white tank top (note to self: stop wearing white around these kids). I was actually kind of excited because it meant I got to put my newly purchased bottle of Miss Mouth's Messy Eater Stain Treater Spray to the test! I followed the directions on the bottle that said to dampen the stained area, spray it with the stain remover, then pop it into the washing machine as usual. What do ya know — it really worked! Completely cleared away all the red stains! Not sure what witchcraft has been used to make this product, but I'm here for it."" — Heather Braga Promising review: ""My 1-year-old has taco meat stains ALL over the sleeves of his shirt. The stains were 2–3 days old, too. I sprayed the shirt, let it sit for about 15 minutes, and then washed the shirt with regular laundry soap. Almost every bit of the stains came out. Definitely buying bulk in this product!"" — Sloan Avery Get it from Amazon for $7.97 (available in three sizes and multipacks). 3. A Ninja Swirl machine that makes soft serve ice cream at the touch of a button, which is truly the future Spy Kids promised us. You can also use it to whip up frozen yogurt, frozen custard, sorbet, milkshakes, and scooped ice cream. Heather Braga / BuzzFeed ""I have this machine and can assure you it is actually worth every penny. IDK about you, but where I live in New York, it's gotten VERY expensive to go out for ice cream (or buy it to bring home). Now that I have a family of four, it just makes more sense to find a way to make our favorite flavors at home. Setting the Ninja Swirl up was very simple; the ""hardest"" part is just remembering to freeze the ""base"" of your ice creams ahead of time so they're ready to be ""spun"" when you want to eat them. I've seen all over TikTok how people 'meal prep' their ice creams for the week and just pop 'em in the freezer (incredible). Anyways, the soft serve feature is incredible!..."

Charlotte Tilbury in der Farbe Sherry Glow testen – und ich muss sagen: Ich bin wirklich positiv überrascht! Zuerst das Packaging – typisch Charlotte Tilbury: luxuriös, hochwertig und einfach ein Hingucker auf jedem Schminktisch. Der Blush selbst ist ein flüssiges Gel-Cream-Produkt, das sich super einfach mit den Fingern oder einem Pinsel auftragen lässt. Die Textur ist leicht und verschmilzt fast schon mit der Haut – kein Absetzen, kein Fleckigwerden. Die Farbe ""Sherry Glow"" ist ein wunderschöner, warm-rosiger Ton mit einem ganz feinen Glow. Kein grober Glitzer, sondern eher ein natürlich strahlender Schimmer, der dem Gesicht sofort Frische verleiht. Ich finde, der Ton passt besonders gut zu mittleren bis leicht gebräunten Hauttönen – er zaubert diese “frisch-von-der-Sonne-geküsst”-Ausstrahlung. Mein Fazit: Ein tolles Produkt für alle, die den “dewy”, frischen Look lieben! Wer auf natürliche Ausstrahlung steht und Lust auf einen unkomplizierten Sommer-Blush hat, wird mit ""Sherry Glow"" richtig glücklich. Für mich ein echtes Highlight in meiner Sommer-Make-up-Routine obwohl ich eher immer noch zum Puder tendiere. 9 von 10 ⭐ #complimentary #charlottetilbury #unrealblush #influenster #produkttester #testen #blush #rouge #beautyprodukte #luxuriös #cherryglow"

The floral maxi dress, which is just £48, is part of Roman's summer collection and would be perfect for park picnics or days out at the beach. And, right now, shoppers can save an extra 10% using the code HAPPY. The dress boasts short sleeves, offering some coverage, an attention-grabbing shirred waist, and a tassel tie detail. There's even a modest slit in the skirt for that extra bit of breeziness, reports Nottingham Post. When it comes to accessorising, the options are endless. Dress it up with sparkling heels and gold trinkets for formal occasions, or pair it with ballet flats and standout sunglasses for casual garden get-togethers. The dress comes in a selection of different patterns, too, including various floral prints and an on-trend polka dot print. The dress comes in sizes 10 to 20. However, several sizes are already sold out in some of the patterns. If your size isn't available, Phase Eight also offers a fantastic range, including this floral maxi dress (£109, originally £189) with long sleeves for a similar feel to the Roman dress. For something different yet equally enchanting, Joe Browns showcases a stunning floral knee-length number (£48), available in both petite and regular sizes. It's designed to highlight the waist and features a delightful V-neckline. Customers have been heaping praise on the Roman Originals light blue dress, with one satisfied buyer exclaiming: ""It's a lovely colour, and the material keeps you cool in this hot weather."" Another happy shopper shared their enthusiasm: ""I love this dress. It fits my size 16, hangs nicely, and looks good with my trainers."" One more pleased customer couldn't hide their delight: ""I just love this dress - I feel amazing in it. When you are a larger person, as I am, it isn't easy to find something you like. The dress flows and gives me a nicer shape. Everyone thought I looked amazing and that I had lost some weight."" Yet, not all reviews were positive, with a dissatisfied customer stating: ""I loved this dress but was very disappointed with the length. It was far too long."" On the other hand, another contented patron praised their find: ""(The dress is) beautiful, a wonderful fit, and a perfect length. I'm 5'7"". When you put on the dress, you feel amazing. It's a dress that can be worn for any occasion. "".

Still, that doesn't mean they're not a good supplementary treatment to have in your skincare regimen, especially if you have chronically dry, dehydrated skin. Since toners are an optional step, if you do choose to use a toner, it should at least check off a few boxes, but one, in particular, is of the most importance: hydration. But what is a toner, anyway? “A toner is a solution that typically contains actives and is designed to be used after cleansing and before moisturizing. Toners can balance pH, remove impurities, exfoliate, and hydrate. They are not necessary, but they can provide great benefits,” says Dr. Blair Murphy-Rose, a board-certified dermatologist at Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York and clinical instructor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. For those with dry skin, “the benefits of a toner depend on the specific formulation and the ingredients it contains. Many toners contain exfoliating actives that help to improve tone and texture, reduce dullness, diminish hyperpigmentation, and bring a glow to the skin,” she adds. Toners made specifically for dry skin can “hydrate, balance pH, and remove residual oils.” Best Calming Toner ANUA Heartleaf 77 Soothing Toner Read more Best Toner for Beginners CeraVe Hydrating Toner Read more Best for Gentle Exfoliation Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant Read more While your TikTok and Instagram bookmark tab is likely chock-full of toners on your wishlist, we did the hard work for you by combing through dozens of online customer reviews and our personal stash to find the 12 best toners for dry skin.

mov_F4B5B8543CB34C8AB29B72ECA9E19296,2025-07-03 07:39:13,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]La tendencia de “maquillaje sin maquillaje” sigue fuerte, pero con un giro: ahora no solo queremos lucir frescas, también estructuradas. Y para lograrlo sin 17 productos ni gastar una fortuna, entra en escena Rimmel London Sculpting Palette, una joya low cost con tres tonos que trabajan en sinergia: bronceador, iluminador y colorete, todo en un compacto que cabe en cualquier bolso y cuesta apenas 6 euros. ¿Lo mejor? No es una paleta cualquiera. Fue desarrollada junto a Kate Moss, quien aporta ese toque cool británico a una fórmula práctica y efectiva. La promesa de la paleta es clara: esculpir, iluminar y dar color al rostro con naturalidad. Pero en la práctica, también ofrece versatilidad total: El bronceador es de tono neutro, sin subtono naranja, ideal para contorno sutil o efecto sunkissed. El iluminador tiene destello fino, nada glitter, que aporta ese glow elegante estilo Hailey Bieber. El rubor es rosa-melocotón universal, favorecedor en todo tipo de pieles, que da ese toque de vitalidad instantánea. Además, su textura sedosa y modulable permite trabajar las capas sin dejar manchones ni exceso de polvo. Se difumina fácil con brocha, esponja o incluso con los dedos si estás fuera de casa. Rimmel no es nuevo en el juego, pero esta paleta lleva meses en los primeros puestos de ventas de Amazon y es protagonista de muchos tutoriales en TikTok y YouTube. ¿La razón? Hace el trabajo de tres productos de lujo en un solo gesto. Muchas influencers la comparan con: La Filmstar Bronze & Glow de Charlotte Tilbury (pero 40 euros más barata). El Dior Backstage Glow Face Palette, por su efecto de segunda piel. O incluso con Fenty Beauty, en cuanto a practicidad y pigmentación. Además, en un contexto donde buscamos optimizar rutinas y espacio (bye neceser gigante), una paleta todo en uno tiene un valor emocional: es eficiente, compacta y libre de complicaciones. Por 6 euros, la Rimmel Sculpting Palette ofrece calidad, practicidad y versatilidad. Perfecta para principiantes, minimalistas, chicas que viajan o quienes buscan un glow con poco esfuerzo. No sustituye a productos de gama alta en textura extrema o larga duración tipo red carpet, pero para el día a día y looks de oficina o citas, es más que suficiente. Además, es un recordatorio de que el buen maquillaje no tiene por qué costar una fortuna. Porque al final, el estilo es lo que haces con lo que tienes, no lo que cuesta. @mundistyle"

mov_058A476C836C36EC4FB309836609132E,2025-07-03 13:09:18,en,WEB,"  In honour of their charitable work with The King's Trust, the human-rights attorney and the beauty mogul sat down with Glamour's global editorial director Samantha Barry to discuss sisterhood, advocacy, and why showing up for women isn't a luxury, it's a legacy. The first time Amal Clooney met Charlotte Tilbury, the human rights lawyer was preparing for her wedding. Charlotte arrived at her front door heavily pregnant and wheeling five oversized suitcases of makeup. Amal blinked at the sheer theatricality of it. “Is all that for me?” she asked. For the renowned makeup artist, that was travelling light. By the time of the wedding, Charlotte was no longer just the makeup artist getting the bride ready—she was an invited guest. Their connection, built on shared energy and strong maternal figures, became the beginning of something much more enduring: a sisterhood rooted in purpose, ambition, love, and a healthy dose of honesty. They come from different worlds (although as Charlotte points out, both are Aquarius with Pisces mothers)—one a decorated human rights lawyer, the other a global beauty entrepreneur. Amal has led landmark cases for women who went on to be Nobel laureates – like Nadia Murad and Maria Ressa. She has defended political prisoners, helped free journalists across continents, and shaped justice systems from Myanmar to The Hague. As cofounder of the Clooney Foundation for Justice with her husband, actor and director, George Clooney, she has now created a global network that provides free legal representation to thousands of women and girls around the world and helped free dozens of journalists who have been imprisoned for their speech. Charlotte has built a bona fide beauty empire valued at over $1 billion, was the first makeup artist to receive an MBE—member of the Order of the British Empire, an honour awarded by the monarch for a particular achievement—and is a definitive staple in makeup bags for millions of people across the globe. I've known both women for years. Amal and I have been close friends since our single days in London, when I was working as a television producer for the BBC and Amal was already a phenomenal legal mind working as a barrister at law firm Doughty Street Chambers. I met Charlotte at Amal's wedding, where the sparkle on her eye shadow was rivalled only by her energy on the dance floor. Since then I've followed their work and their life paths. On a sunny June morning, I sit with both women in Amal's English country home to do more than just catch up—to discuss empowering initiatives that are dear to them both. Amal and Charlotte have just been at Buckingham Palace where they've used their friendship as a launchpad for real impact via their work with The King's Trust, a charitable organisation founded by King Charles III (then Prince Charles) in 1976. It was renamed from The Prince's Trust in 2024 and focuses on providing young people who are facing challenges with mentorship, funding, job training, and skill building. Both Amal and Charlotte have spent the last four years mentoring and uplifting young women from around the world—Kenya, Pakistan, India—many of whom are survivors of poverty, forced marriage, or systemic violence. The award created by the Trust in Amal's name honors one extraordinary young woman each year, while Charlotte hosts hands-on workshops to teach entrepreneurship and confidence. And then there are the Albie Awards, hosted by the Clooney Foundation for Justice—an annual event that shines a spotlight on the unsung heroes who are fighting for justice: journalists, advocates, and human rights defenders risking their lives for truth. Charlotte is not only a sponsor but truly committed to the vision. This fall the Albies will take place in London for the first time at the city's National History Museum. Amal's kitchen table, where we settled in to do our interview, still held the remains of breakfast. There were updates about children, requests for tea and Coca-Cola, and gentle teasing. Amal's husband, George, popped in and out—always charming, always supportive, joking about his rival photo shoot taking place in the garden. This is a friendship that glows with love and joy, but it's also girded by hard work, deep trust, and shared mission. There is fun , yes, but also courtroom advocacy, cross-continental mentorship, and real-time strategy over WhatsApp. It's women who understand that showing up for one another isn't a luxury, it's a legacy. Samantha Barry: Let's go back to that first meeting between you two. What do you both remember? Amal Clooney: When Charlotte showed up at my door with all those suitcases, I was aghast. I was like, “Are you going to need all of those products?” But I loved her energy and we got on so well. Charlotte Tilbury: I fell in love with Amal because she's such an inspiration. And I met her mother Baria, too; she's actually helped me when I had to go and do TV interviews. I think all the women in her family are actually very inspirational. I mean, Amal obviously is a major champion of empowerment of women around the world. You're an inspiration to all and to me. Amal: Well, can I just say I feel the same about you because I'm always so proud, because I think people meet Charlotte and they see this really attractive, bubbly, friendly, really down-to-earth person. And I'm always keen to point out, “By the way, she's one of the most successful female entrepreneurs to ever come out of the United Kingdom.” Amal, this weekend you talked about George in such a beautiful way. Can you share what he means to your work? Amal: I have a partner in life who is so supportive of what I do. So I don't feel like I have to apologize for it or rein it in. And I remember when I became a mom, which was obviously a new frontier, he was the first one to say, “I know you've got this speech at the Security Council. You have to go, I've got the kids, don't worry about it.”..."

The activist, 47, recently spoke with Glamour about her partnership with husband George Clooney, her private family life and boundary setting in a conversation with Charlotte Tilbury. Amal, who shares 8-year-old twins Ella and Alexander with the Oscar-winning actor, 64, revealed that when guests visit her home, she takes away their phones to create a safe space for private moments.

""I now have a phone basket that I use to take everyone's phones away!"" ""It's important to get that balance where you have time alone with your family and with your friends where people feel like you can have a safe and frank exchange,"" she added. ""And I would say becoming a parent means you're more troubled by some of the intrusions. So we do the best we can to minimize any impact on our children.

And if the tournament made them famous, it also transformed their lives off the pitch. From lucrative brand ambassadorships with high-end fashion labels such as Gucci to turns on the red carpet in dresses worthy of a Kardashian, England's female footballers now enjoy more than a touch of glitz and glamour. Once badly paid and barely recognised – who could forget goalie Mary Earps complaining before the last Euros that Nike hadn't even bothered to print replica shirts with her name on them – the nation's female footballers now have a soaring commercial appeal. So as they prepare to face France at 8pm tonight in their first game of this year's Euros – and inspire a new generation of young women with their sporting prowess – Molly Clayton reveals which of our Lionesses enjoys the most luxurious lifestyle. The Gucci model Shoots for Vogue, GQ and Elle Magazine. Modelling for Calvin Klein. Gucci snapping her up as a brand ambassador. Clearly, as well as being an impressive England captain, Leah Williamson, 28, has a catwalk-worthy fashion career too. One of the biggest earners off the pitch after leading the Lionesses to victory at the Euro 2022 final, the blonde beauty has a deal with Nike and has collaborated with global brands such as Aston Martin, Pepsi, Walkers and Mastercard. With 1.1 million Instagram followers, she has new advert partnerships with Weetabix and Cadbury, along with six children's books, titled The Wonder Team. With the deals comes the gloss: her recent lavish Mallorcan holiday to an Ikos resort would have set her back in the region of £1,000 a night. She is rumoured to be dating former model and Miss USA Elle Smith – both have posted about each other on social media. Ella the business brainbox With her ever-present fake eyelashes and love of make-up, Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, 25, often showcases her beauty routine on her own YouTube channel. And with a canny business acumen to boot, Ella has already shaped an enviable off-pitch career. The first England women's player to trademark her name, she's set up her own brand, ET7, which includes a football academy for young girls. The name is inspired by her childhood hero, Portuguese footballing superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, whose own brand is called CR7. With some estimating her worth at more than £1 million, last month she set up her own creative agency, Amicizia, which aims to connect female athletes to commercial and marketing opportunities with top brands. Her sponsors include make-up company Charlotte Tilbury, orthodontic brand Invisalign and McDonald's, with her yearly earnings estimated as upwards of £200,000, fuelled by her popularity on social media. At one point, she was one of the top five most viewed athletes on TikTok. Ella has 737,000 Instagram followers and her own BBC podcast with best friend and fellow Lioness Alessia Russo, with whom she has appeared on the front cover of fashion and beauty magazine Elle. Ella loves nothing more than a red carpet bash. In a relationship with footballer Joe Bunney of Stalybridge Celtic FC, she regularly treats her fans to glimpses of their lavish holidays abroad and spa days at five-star hotels. Lauren's ooh la la lego Proving that every passion can be profitable, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, 24, has topped up her estimated £400,000 salary with a sponsorship deal with Lego. Devoted to creating Lego masterpieces in her downtime, saying it's 'the best way to relax', she's even made the Mona Lisa out of the bricks. Her other sponsors include Nike and Sports Direct. Lauren also has the support of her girlfriend, former Liverpool midfielder Ashley Hodson. Together for two years, the pair recently enjoyed a romantic trip to Paris, where Lauren saw the Mona Lisa in her more traditional setting. Shy superstar with an ex on the team Growing up, Lucy Bronze lived on Lindisfarne – also known as Holy Island – off the windswept coast of Northumberland. Her grandmother was caretaker of Lindisfarne Castle and today the outline of that building is tattooed on Lucy's wrist. Shy into adulthood, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism in 2021. But neither her isolated upbringing nor her neurodiversity held her back. Rather, she's said she uses the intense focus associated with her conditions to her advantage – and now the 33-year-old is one of the biggest earners in the game. She reportedly took home £200,000 a year while playing at Barcelona before her move to Chelsea in 2024. Big money deals followed her triumph at the last Euros, with Pepsi, EE, Klarna and Visa among her backers. Her former girlfriend is fellow Lioness Keira Walsh. Fashion week regular She earned almost £2 million in 2023 alone, according to Forbes magazine. That same year, Alessia Russo's transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal made her one of the most expensive female footballers on the planet. Her contract is said to be worth more than £500,000 a year and her commercial appeal is just as lucrative. She has deals with Gucci, Adidas, PlayStation, Beats by Dr Dre and last month was gifted an MGS5 EV car, which she proudly showed off on Instagram. A regular at London Fashion Week, Alessia, 26, has appeared on the cover of magazines such as Women's Health. The BAFTA TV Awards in May saw her in a £1,295 Roland Mouret dress, right.

BURBERRY CLAD GOALIE BURBERRY HANNAH Hampton - the longhaired goalkeeper with the girl-next-door looks - certainly has big shoes to fill after Mary Earps surprisingly announced her retirement from the squad last month. The 24-year-old Chelsea player has posed in Burberry for Elle magazine and counts Nike and Extra chewing gum among her corporate sponsors. She also works with Birmingham Children's Hospital after enduring numerous eye operations as a child to cure a squint. Hannah was told she would never be a professional sports player. ' I've gone through life proving people wrong,' she said recently, words that inspired devotion among her 228,000 Instagram followers. Her relationship status isn't known. DUBAI DEVOTEE SHE never travels without her Louis Vuitton luggage, can often be seen posing in a Maybach car, and enjoys swanky trips to Dubai, staying at the luxury Five resort there. Chelsea star Lauren James, 23, has treated herself to some of the finer things in life since her key role in the Lionesses' 2023 World Cup campaign. While her relationship status isn't known, she's close to her older brother Reece, who plays for the Chelsea men's team. She has commercial deals with Nike, Google Pixel, Optimum Nutrition, Sure deodorant and Walkers. The superstar siblings often attend red carpet events together. But while she is reportedly on £350,000 a year at Chelsea, Reece earns £250,000 a week. KOOKY STYLE SO DEVOTED is she to tattoos that midfielder Georgia Stanway, 26, not only has around 100 of her own inkings, but she's also learned to tattoo other people. The Bayern Munich star's kooky style has won her sponsors including Nike and an advertising deal with Celsius drinks, who featured on her Instagram page, where she has 433,000 followers. Off the pitch, she's been with Toulouse rugby league player Olly Ashall-Bott since 2022...."

The A list actor hailed the show as the 'greatest' she'd ever seen. Other famous faces to watch the performance included former Doctor Who star Matt Smith, who was also at last night's gig, and makeup mogul Charlotte Tilbury. Danny Dyer, Holly Willoughby and Vernon Kay were some of the stars on show for last night's concert. When Sienna was asked by The Mirror what she thought of the concert, she joked: ""It was alright,"" before revealing she was there for both Cardiff gigs. ""It's the greatest show I've ever seen. The love and the nostalgia and the joy, it's like saving the world."" Matt Smith said the show was ""amazing"". Oasis returned for a second night at the Principality Stadium to perform another two hour show, with the 23 song setlist unchanged from last night. The set started with Hello, the first song on 1995's (What's the Story) Morning Glory, and again ended with Champagne Supernova. The Gallagher brothers again strode onto the stage, arm in arm, as they did on Friday night. Liam then bowed down before his brother, as seen on fan footage of the gig. Like the first night, Liam enjoyed some banter with the crowd. After Bring It On Down, he asked the crowd to 'do the Poznan', the celebration which Manchester City fans took from Polish side Lech Poznan, where supporters turn their back to the game and jump up and down, arm in arm. Noel also got involved. Before beginning Half The World Away, he joked: ""This is for the Royale Family!"" During the final bars of Whatever, Liam changed the words and sang a few lines from The Beatles' Octopus's Garden. During Don't Look Back in Anger, tributes were again paid to victims of the Manchester Arena attack, with images of bees appearing on the big screen. Ending with Champagne Supernova, the band played the same setlist as the opening show of the tour. The brothers from Burnage were again joined on stage by guitarist Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs, who is back with both Gallaghers for the first time in 25 years after leaving the group in 1999. The founding members were joined by long-time members Andy Bell, previously of shoegaze icons Ride, and guitarist Gem Archer, who replaced Bonehead. Completing the line up is new drummer Joey Waronker, who recently performed on Liam Gallagher and John Squire's recent album. Touring members also include Christian Madden on keyboards, Jessica Greenfield on backing vocals, Alastair White on trombone, Steve Hamilton on saxophone and Joe Auckland on trumpet.

CeraVe's Retinol Serum, which lives up to the CeraVe name and uses *encapsulated* retinol to reduce the appearance of scars and pores without flaking or redness. If you haven't gotten into retinoids yet or are worried about irritating your skin, this gentle but effective serum is a great option — and reviewers say they like it better than other more expensive options (like Murad's Retinol Serum, which retails for $92). And remember, like with any retinol (that actually works) *just do not use it every day. * Start slow and work yourself up if needed, paying attention to your skin. Promising review: ""I absolutely love this stuff! I saw a dermatologist on TikTok who raved about this product and tried it out, and it's been the most amazing stuff! It's helped my face to clear up very quickly removing all of the blemish spots and dark spots around my face. It's been one of the best products I've added to my face routine. This would be great for all ages/stages and for any weather types. It doesn't moisturize much, but that's not it's intention, and there is no scent, so I'd imagine it's great for all skin types and hypoallergenic."" —Successful Solo Promising review: ""I bought this for my teenager to use for his acne scars, but he ended up not using it. I ran out of my Murad retinol serum, so I gave this a try. I actually like it better than the Murad! It absorbs quickly, with zero smell or irritation. As with any retinol product, be sure to wear sunscreen when you're going to be outside."" —C. Munsterman Get it from Amazon for $18.68. 2. E.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter that reviewers say is comparable to (or even better than) Charlotte Tilbury's famous Flawless Filter. Apply this as a luminous, blurring base, mix it with your moisturizer or foundation, or dot it over makeup as a natural-looking highlight. It's formulated with hyaluronic acid and squalene for a boost of hydration too! Promising review: ""This stuff is so legit I've gone through three bottles. Adds the perfect glow to your skin! Sometimes I use it under foundation, and sometimes, I use it solo with a bit of concealer. I will never not repurchase it for the price and how beautifully it sits on the skin. This stuff is viral for a reason!!"" —mapagill Promising review: ""If you like Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter, this is leaps and bounds better! Just buy it. The coverage is better and makes my skin have the most amazing natural glow! The colors run with a more warm/yellow undertone, which worked great for me! Spend a fraction of the price and just get it; you will be happy you did!"" —Amazonreview Get it from Amazon for $14 (available in 12 shades). 3. And their Halo Glow Beauty Wand, a buildable liquid highlighter formula that delivers a majorly radiant, lit-from-within finish to your skin without lots of glitter (like Charlotte Tilbury's highlighter blush wands). The cushion-tip applicator is super easy to apply, too! One reviewer says it's an alternative to the Charlotte Tilbury highlighters! Promising review: ""We saw this highlighter in a makeup tutorial video online and thought we would try it. It was an easy decision to purchase it because the price was relatively low compared to other highlighters. It is worth every penny and more! I've seen this shade applied on different skin tones and it looks beautiful on everyone! Just the right shimmer, not glitter. It's gorgeous!"" —Joyinmyheart Get it from Amazon for $9 (available in three shades). E.l.f. also has reviewer-loved glowy blush and contour shades in the same wand design!..."
mov_3DB2B71E315E1E218D558EECD33BF5BF,2025-07-07 09:32:56,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Eines der größten Schönheitsunternehmen der Welt ist Berichten zufolge einen Verkauf von sich selbst. Anfang Juni berichtete WWD, dass Coty erwägt, seine Verbraucher- und Prestige-Divisionen zu veräußern, darunter einige der bekanntesten Marken von Beauty wie Covergirl sowie Chloé- und Hugo-Chef-Parfums. Die Ankündigung versetzte den Aktienkurs von Coty 13 Prozent auf 5 USD; Die Veräußerung beider Waffen würde im Wesentlichen mehr als 120 Jahre als Unternehmen beendet. Coty lehnte es ab, sich zu dem Bericht zu äußern. Trotz seiner Größe und Stall bekannter Namen hat das amerikanische Konglomerat in den letzten Jahren Schwierigkeiten, mit seinen Konkurrenten Schritt zu halten. Innerhalb des Portfolios seines größten Anteilseigners Jab Holdings ist Coty das schlechteste Kapital und senkt den Ausblick im letzten Geschäftsjahr, wobei weitere Umsatzrückgänge projiziert werden. Coty hat versucht, sein Ansehen zu verbessern. Seit seinem derzeitigen CEO Sue Nabi im Jahr 2020 eintraf, hat das Unternehmen das Fett getrimmt und nicht-Kernmarken wie Professional Lines Wella und OPI abgebrochen. Aber es bleibt immer noch seine äußeren Kollegen wie L'Oréal und Elf Beauty zurück, und im Mai verkaufte es Skkn von Kim, der Prestige-Hautpflegemarke, an seinen Gründer zurück, den Multi-Hyphenate-Reality-Star Kim Kardashian und ihre Bekleidungsfirma Skims, nachdem die Marke versäumt hatte, mit Schaufenster für Furore zu machen. Die Kerngeschäfte, Duft- und Drogerie -Make -up, stehen ebenfalls unter Druck. Während der Duft die kategorische Kategorie der Branche ist und Coty einige der weltweit bekanntesten Düfte der Welt herstellt, ist der heftig wettbewerbsfähige Sektor mit neuen Herausforderern gefüllt. Die Bemühungen, das Summen wie trendige Körpermists für Calvin Klein und die Wiederbelebung von Marc Jacobs Beauty zu fördern, sind in einem von Nischenspieler und Tiktok -Viralität dominierten Markt ein Rückgang des Ozeans. Die Drogerie -Marken haben ebenfalls unterdurchschnittlich geschafft. “So ziemlich alles in der Messe hat nicht funktioniert … Ich gebe ihnen viel Anerkennung dafür, dass sie kreativ sind und Dinge ausprobieren”, sagte Lauren Lieberman, Geschäftsführer bei Barclays Consumer Practice, in der Bemühungen zur Wiederbelebung von Covergirl. Sie bemerkte auch die gedämpfte Wiederbelebung der Philosophie, die Hautpflege und die Bade- und Körperlinie, die ein großer Erfolg in den Aughts sowie die Sun Care Line Lancaster war. Mit dem Rücktritt von Jab Holdings 'langjähriger Vorsitzender Peter Harb im April wird neue Führung wahrscheinlich für ein neues Denken bereit sein. Wenn Coty versucht, Käufer von Gerichts zu nehmen, sind potenzielle Bieter schlank und würden wahrscheinlich in einige ausgewählte Kategorien fallen. bricht zusammen, wer interessiert sein könnte – und warum – unten. Die Kronjuwelen Prestige -Duft bleibt Cotys heißeste Eigenschaft. Es enthält langfristige Lizenzen für Chloé, Gucci, Hugo-Chef und Calvin Klein, einige der berühmtesten Modehäuser der Welt. Hugo -Chef wird als die größte Marke des Unternehmens angesehen, die rund 10 Prozent oder rund 585 Millionen US -Dollar in Höhe von rund 9 Prozent und 7 Prozent des Gesamtumsatzes des Unternehmens umfasst. Dies sind wünschenswerte Vermögenswerte, selbst mit intensiver Konkurrenz durch Inseln auf dem Weg. Diese Düfte des Modehaus sind weit verbreitet, bekannt und haben ein integriertes Prestige und Dynamik. Ein Spezialist für Duftlizenzspezialist wie Interphlum, das für Lacoste und Anna Sui Parfums herstellt, könnte theoretisch interessiert sein. Seit 2022 hat es DKNY wiederbelebt und die Linie neu anspricht, nachdem LVMH sie an die G-III-Gruppe, ein Modeportfoliounternehmen, abgeladen hatte. Das spanische Konglomerat Puig könnte auch ein Anwärter sein; Während es sein Vertrauen in die Lizenzierung verringert hat und sich stattdessen auf den Besitz von Marken verändert hat, nachdem sie Byredo und Charlotte Tilbury aufgenommen haben, verwaltet es geschickt ähnliche Modehaus-Duftmarken wie Carolina Herrera und Jean-Paul Gaultier und könnte dazu beitragen, dass die Marken frische Energie injizieren könnten. Mode -Lizenzunternehmen wie Tapestry, PVH Corp oder Capri könnten auch daran interessiert sein, ihre Bestände zu diversifizieren und dem Mix Schönheit zu verleihen, insbesondere für bewährte Linien wie Burberry und Calvin Klein, von denen letztere das Modegeschäft besitzt. Der Luxusmarken ' Mutterunternehmen möchten möglicherweise auch ihre Schönheitsangebote wieder in Haus bringen. Der Gucci-Besitzer Kering hat kein Geheimnis aus seinen lauwartigen Gefühlen gegenüber der Gucci-Schönheitsmarke unter Cotys Besitz, die 2028 abläuft, kein Geheimnis gemacht, und Kering hat jetzt eine interne Schönheitsabteilung mit Creed. LVMH, dem Marc Jacobs gehört, hat sich als Expertise in Beauty bewährt und Schönheitsangebote wie Dior und Guerlain verwaltet. „Die Tatsache, dass Coty gedauert hat [as a company] So lange ist, weil Duft ein so großartiges Geschäft ist “, sagte Lieberman. In jüngerer Zeit beginnen Unternehmen wie LVMH und KERING ihre eigenen Schönheitswaffen oder konsolidieren ihre Bemühungen auf andere Weise. Lieberman sagte, andere Firmen wie Puig oder Fashion Lizenzierhäuser könnten alle logische Bieter sein, aber das Reiben ist, dass Cotys Fähigkeit, diese Lizenzen zu verkaufen, nicht eindeutig ist. Abhängig von der Art der unterzeichneten ursprünglichen Vereinbarungen können sie möglicherweise das Eigentum an ein neues Unternehmen übertragen. Massenbeschwerde Cotys Sortiment an Massenmarken wie Rimmel und Covergirl hat eine Namenserkennung, aber das Wachstum hat stagniert, da sie Marktanteile an schneller bewegende Indies wie Elf Beauty und Kiko Milano abgeschlossen haben. Sally Hansen ist laut Nielsen-IQ-Daten die größte Massennagelmarke der USA mit einem Marktanteil von 38 Prozent, obwohl der Umsatz auch gesunken ist, da die Verbraucher länger anhaltende Behandlungen priorisieren. Während die Massenmarken von Coty oft unter den Top 10 rangieren, ist der Drogeriekanal in den USA insgesamt weniger lukrativ geworden, da die Auswahl der Marken und im Geschäftserfahrung nicht mit Amazon und zunehmend Tiktok-Shop konkurrieren. Es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass ein strategischer Käufer eine so durchdrungene Marke mit niedrigem Wachstumskaderraum übernehmen möchte, aber Private Equity könnte für die Herausforderung stehen, insbesondere wenn er internationale Möglichkeiten für die Marken sieht. Solche Carve-Outs sind nicht ungewöhnlich in der Schönheit, sondern konzentrieren sich häufig auf Prestige-Marken: Private Equity Firm Advent Creecting im Jahr 2022, um Bareminerals, Buxom und Laura Mercier von Shiseido zu kaufen, während Coty einige seiner professionellen Marken, einschließlich Wella Company, im Jahr 2020 zum Private Equity-Unternehmen KKR abfuhr. Coty besitzt auch einige in Brasilien ansässige Körperpflege -Linien wie Bozzano, Monange, Paixao und Risiken, was für einen inländischen Spieler wie den früheren Aesop und Avon -Besitzer Natura mit seinem Heimatvorteil von Interesse sein könnte. Unabhängig davon, welcher Weg es weitergibt, ist eine Neukalibrierung wahrscheinlich bei Coty erforderlich. Und Käufer achten Sie auf-selbst die bekanntesten Marken von Beauty kämpfen darum, ein sinnvolles Wachstum in einer so wettbewerbsfähigen Landschaft zu erzielen. “[Coty's] Marken sollten relevant sein, aber es ist draußen überfüllt “, sagte Lieberman.

mov_BD3AD5B6C04A9E879461F0BF61409BDF,2025-07-07 13:01:45,en,WEB,"  – Spice strategy. The best journalism often comes from topics that writers are personally passionate about—an obsession they have, or a question they can't stop thinking about. That's what happened for my colleague Jessica Mathews and her new Fortune story about Diaspora Co. The 8-year-old startup now pulling in “mid-millions” per year sells high-quality spices sourced from 140 farms. Founder Sana Javeri Kadri started with turmeric, after noting its growing popularity in the U.S., and has expanded to black pepper, cardamom, spice blends, and more. Among foodies and those who care about high-quality ingredients, the brand is incredibly popular. Jessica reached out to Javeri Kadri because she wanted to know, essentially, why and how her spices taste so good. The founder told her that most spices are indigenous to South Asia, and taste different when grown there—even compared to the same seeds, extracted and planted elsewhere. Diaspora Co. was bootstrapped for five years, before Javeri Kadri raised a $1 million pre-seed round and then a 2024 $1.5 million seed round from a whopping 75 angel investors, from Meena Harris to the founder of Salt & Straw ice cream—a strategy that helped her set aside 35% of the company's equity for farmers and employees. “With the grocery venture capital world right now, you're often selling an unprofitable product at scale and hoping that it'll eventually become profitable,” she told Jessica. “I can't do that for my farm partners—that's a very short-term outlook. I want their kids to inherit their family business, and the family business to be thriving. I want our farmers to be happy,” she says. Read the full story here.

I've even used it a few times and found it very therapeutic. The vibration is strong but not unpleasant, and helps relax the face muscles while your moisturiser helps keep your skin feeling fresh."" A second found it ""more hygienic"" than the Clarisonic Sonic Cleansing Brush, which was a cult-favourite during the 2000s. She commented: ""For years I used Clarisonic but hadn't used it in years due to how unhygienic they are, then I saw this. It is so good and hygienic. I seem to be using silicone for everything right now. This does give a very deep cleanse, you'll get better results with a hydrating cleanser (everyone needs hydration).""

Amazon Prime Day might be grabbing the spotlight, but Nordstrom Anniversary Sale is quietly running one of the hottest sales of the season.

Like many, I take advantage of Amazon Prime Day sales to stock up on the everyday things I use most in life, like contact solution, makeup remover, cleaning products and more. However, it's also the perfect time to shop some of Amazon's best-kept secrets, including products that you just didn't know you could get on Amazon, like luxury beauty products, Away suitcases and even a trendy (yet still effective) hand sanitizer brand. Because I would never gatekeep, I've rounded up quite the assortment of HuffPost's secret top-sellers and clandestine staff faves that are currently majorly discounted for Prime Day. Keep reading and pick up one of these secretly must-have items and enjoy serious deals while they are still hot. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. Touchland Power Mist hydrating hand sanitizer spray trio (30% off list price) Whether you're traveling this summer or simply moving through life, there are plenty of places that we frequent that can get pretty germy, making hand sanitizer a daily essential. The Touchland Power Mist Hydrating hand sanitizer is a great option that not only contains 70% alcohol to kill germs but is infused with nourishing skin care ingredients like aloe vera and lemon essential oil to keep your skin from drying out. L'Oréal Lumi Glotion (41% off list price) We've formally called L'Oreal's Lumi Glotion the perfect shortcut to perfect skin and one of the most convincing alternatives to the famed Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter. Available in five flexible shades, this tinted moisturizer is famous for offering sheer yet luminous coverage and promises to melt seamlessly into skin without setting into fine lines or appearing cakey. Wear it alone, under makeup or as a highlighter and enjoy the formula infusion of long-adored ingredients such as shea butter and glycerin, a humectant that draws moisture into the skin for all-day hydration. Medicube Zero Pore pads (52% off list price) Few items have impressed me as much as these cult-favorite toning facial pads. I've ditched my traditional AHA serums for these bad boys, and my skin has never looked better. The Medicube pads are designed to help exfoliate, balance and brighten skin while reducing oil production, minimizing breakouts and refining the look of pores. They are formulated with powerful alpha and beta hydroxy acids like white willow bark, vitamin C and calming botanical extracts like lavender to soothe skin. I've noticed that my skin is softer, smoother and has a really noticeable glow. Most importantly, I've detected a decrease in melasma, which has plagued me since my pregnancy. They're incredibly potent, and it's very obvious to me why they're so popular. I've tried out other exfoliating pads and can confidently say that these are just as, if not more, effective at a fraction of the price. They've been a game-changer for my skin in the last couple of months, and I just hope they don't sell out now that the secret's out! A multifunctional electric spin scrubber brush (38% off list price) There's a good chance you've spotted bathroom spin scrubber brushes on social media, but this is the first time we've eyed a multi-use brush that can be used everywhere from the bathroom to the kitchen (although for sanitary reasons, we recommend you grab two for separate use in those rooms), on dishes and beyond. It includes a kitchen spin scrubber, a small flat brush, a sisal brush, two scouring pad brushes, two sponge brushes, two descaling brushes and a velcro adaptor for pads. This little guy will leave no grime left behind! A wireless CarPlay adapter (50% off list price) With this one tiny gadget, you'll have the power to seamlessly connect your phone to your vehicle's CarPlay system so that every function you enjoy on your phone — calls, voice commands, maps, music and more — can be accessible without needing to manually plug in. This even extends to the physical controls on your steering wheel. Please note that this lightning-fast adapter is only compatible with iPhones 10 and above. A similar model is often popping up on TikTok, but this one is our special secret. It's especially good for anyone proudly pushing an older vehicle that doesn't have Bluetooth capabilities. Clinique Almost Lipstick tinted lip balm (30% off list price) Many beauty lovers know that this perfectly hued beauty product is the end-all be-all of lip balms. It's available in Black Honey and Pink Honey shades, though Black Honey is a cult-favorite lip color that's considered universally flattering and has been popular since the early aughts. This semi-glossy balm is perfect for everyday wear and many a beauty insider's secret weapon. I honestly can't believe it's available as an Amazon Prime Day deal! Away Bigger carry-on luggage (20% off list price) The Bigger carry-on is what put Away on the map. It fits an astonishing amount of clothing while still complying with carry-on regulations for most major airlines. It's a game-changer for people who never want to check a bag. Like all of Away's suitcases, it's made with durable, water-repellent and lightweight materials and 360-degree wheels that glide with ease. The adjustable trolley handle has two height settings, while the interior compression pad system and organizer makes it easy to load up on clothing. It also comes with a water-repellent laundry bag and is available in seven colors. Away bags only landed on Amazon a of couple of months ago, and no one was expecting them to be included during Prime Day sales. A pair of silky pajamas (28% off list price) Parsing through the myriad of clothing deals during Prime Day is a bit of a chore, and the really good stuff easily gets lost in the shuffle, like this lightweight set. It is soft, breathable and feels silky smooth against the skin...."

mov_FCD9CCFF858DFF77CA557E2040CDE28F,2025-07-08 15:19:16,en,WEB,"  As a beauty writer I'm always on the look-out for new products to add to my arsenal so while on a recent holiday to Portugal I had to know what self-tan my friend was using to achieve her gorgeous glow. The item in question turned out to be the Isle of Paradise Self-Tanning Body Drops, which come in three shades - light, medium and dark. Founded by celebrity tanning expert Jules Von Hep, several A-listers have been rumoured to use products from Isle of Paradise including Margot Robbie who was reportedly tanned using the medium self-tanning water for the Barbie Tour. The self-tanning drops would typically retail for £24.95, however, an Amazon Prime Day deal sees them reduced to £17.89. The Amazon offer beats the price shoppers will currently find them at Boots, Sephora and Cult Beauty. To take advantage of the Amazon deal, consumers must be a member of Prime and they can sign up for a free 30-day trial here. READ MORE: Amazon's £28 maxi dress 'hugs every contour' and 'feels just like' Kim Kardashian's brand READ MORE: Fragrance fans snap up £36 Sol de Janeiro tote bag set that's worth £52 Isle of Paradise's self-tanning drops are completely customisable so the user can add as many drops as they wish into their usual body moisturiser. It's a much easier way to tan the body, ensuring less risk of streaks and patchy tan. The formula is also boosted with caffeine, baobab and oat extract to help make the skin appear firmer, brighter and smoother. Shoppers say 'this is the first fake tan I've used where someone has asked me if I'd been on holiday so I'm pretty pleased with it', making it an ideal choice for the summer season. Another loyal customer wrote: ""On my third consecutive bottle. 8 drops gives a healthy skin glow. Looks great under makeup. Nice consistency, dries well and is not patchy as it comes off."" Amazon Prime Sign Up Amazon Prime membership, including exclusive Prime Day discounts and perks on Hello Fresh, music, books and Prime Video. Usually £8.99 a month, you can now get a 30-day free trial to get access to the latest deals. Free Amazon It has been noted by a few users the drops should be 'used sparingly' and one customer gave a warning, writing: ""Beware though, you do need to wash your hands thoroughly after use though otherwise you will be left with brown tide marks on your skin. I would recommend starting off gradually and then adding more as needed."" Other popular self-tanning drops include the Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Island Glow Easy Tanning Drops. They are £38 at Space NK and reviews say 'these are the most flawless tanning drop I've ever used'. However, they only come in two shades, compared the Isle of Paradise's three. Another option that is said to 'hydrate as it glows' are from Pai. The Impossible Tan Hydrating Self Tan Drops retail for £34 at LookFantastic and shoppers say they 'create a lovely natural healthy looking tan'. Customers of Isle of Paradise share before and after results (Image: Amazon) But, the most affordable option out of the above are the Isle of Paradise drops, part of the Amazon Prime Day sale. A happy customer wrote: ""I love this product - I was introduced to it in a gift set and this is me replenishing what I've already used! A couple of drops in my normal moisturiser and I have a natural glow! I keep getting comments on how well I look."" Someone else raved about how it extended their existing tan, writing: ""I bought these drops to carry on my glow from holiday. I am very fair skinned and even after two weeks in the Maldives I was barely tanned! These little drops were great for adding to that, I used two-three drops in with my nighttime moisturiser two or three times a week, that's all I needed and I got compliments from the first use. I think I looked more glowing from these than the holiday."" And a third commented: ""I love this. I first tried a sample of this and fell in love. This product lets you control the tan, I tend to go for 4 drops for a natural looking tan. I just drop the tan into my moisturiser and apply it as normal. It takes about 2-4hrs to develop."""

A third customer expressed their newfound adoration for the fragrance, stating: ""First time trying this perfume and I love it that much that I bought another one, got big size bottles and well worth it. It's my new favourite scent."" Yet, not all feedback was glowing; one customer lamented the perfume's longevity: ""Beautiful scent but doesn't last at all, I have to add more on several times during the day. Smells lovely and fresh though."" Another shopper was left wanting more from the fragrance's intensity: ""Its a nice perfume but the smell is a bit faint, it's a bit too subtle and doesn't last very long. Really need to sniff to figure out the notes."" But a satisfied shopper enthused: ""It's versatile for any occasion and leaves a lasting impression. A true masterpiece."" For those interested in purchasing, Vera Wang's Princess Eau De Toilette is on sale at Amazon.

mov_181E0F98B6EA7258C41EBE14FE81F70C,2025-07-09 09:48:46,en,WEB,"  Shoppers battling with fine or thinning hair are flocking to buy a budget-friendly haircare range that promises to add 200% more thickness after one use, compared to standard shampoo. The John Frieda PROfiller+ Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner set has left users impressed, due to its ability to quickly add volume and thickness to their locks. And now the duo has 33% off for Amazon Prime Day, dropping from £24.99 to £16.74. For those who aren't yet a Prime member, Amazon is offering a free 30-day trial that lets shoppers enjoy all of subscription's perks, including unlimited one-day and next-day deliveries. The John Frieda PROfiller+ range is expertly formulated with biotin and hyaluronic acid to encourage hair growth while plumping hair follicles with hydration to reduce hair loss due to breakage. The formula is silicone-free and vegan friendly and it's easy to use - apply shampoo to wet hair, lather and massage into the scalp, rinse thoroughly. For conditioning, apply the thickening conditioner to the hair, leave in for a few minutes, then rinse out. Shoppers have reported 'noticeable' results, with many asserting their hair is fuller, thicker and easier to manage. One said: ""I've been suffering from hair loss for the last three years, to the point where I was considering buying a wig...my hair is 75% thinner than it was several years ago. I used this shampoo and conditioner yesterday and I immediately noticed a difference, my hair is definitely thicker. Even after one use my hair looks really good, after drying and styling it's soft, shiny and has a lot more volume."" Another commented: ""I am of an age now where my hair is thinning out but after I've washed my hair and conditioned it with these products, it looks so much fuller and shiny. Being able to get it in the larger packs is great because it saved a little bit of money."" ""This is the best my hair has felt in years. I normally have to wash my hair every day but not with this combo. Works for me,"" a third added but a fourth left a remark regarding the scent: ""This duo is perfect for creating volume to thin hair however it leaves a weird fishy odour to your hair after use."" Other than John Frieda, Philip Kingsley's Density Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner Duo is also proven to improve the health, condition and quality of fine, fragile, and shedding hair. Shoppers can enjoy 12% off and get the set at £54.56. Champo's Pitta Volumising Collection is also formulated to strengthen strands, enhancing volume, shine and manageability and the shampoo and conditioner set retails at £38. One five-star shopper left a suggestion in improving the bottle design: ""There is one niggle I have that really does surprise me with the 500ml bottles, they should come with pumps. I have looked at other John Frieda 500ml bottles that come with pumps so why not the new 500ml bottles."" Another, however, said he wouldn't recommend purchasing it and explained: ""Whilst this creates some volume it leaves the hair very coarse and straw-like in texture, which had led to breakage when brushing. I wish I'd spent a bit more on a professional brand. Wouldn't recommend it."" A second also agreed on the post-shampoo ""coarse"" hair and added: ""I've applied a lot of Argan oil to try and soften and untangle it."" But a satisfied customer said: ""My hair has much more body and looks so much better. I also use the thickening spray which is great."" The John Frieda PROfiller+ Thickening Shampoo and Conditioner bundle is available on Amazon for £16.74, or shoppers can buy each product separately at Boots for £9.33 each.

mov_30BE2217CA0C9765682F813E7A8F981F,2025-07-09 13:00:51,en,WEB,"  Does your kaftan have a sequin trim? Adorable! Does your holiday tote bag have a shell bag charm? Cute. Does your maxidress have pom-poms dangling from it? Um, OK, I'm sure it's lovely, but let's take a moment here, shall we? Are you completely sure you need to coordinate your beach jellies with your candy-striped shorts and cropped top? Look, I'm going to come out and ask the question here. Have our holiday wardrobes got a bit … overexcited? I don't want to be a killjoy. But there is a fine line between a cheerful holiday aesthetic and looking as though you bought the entire contents of your suitcase while on a sangria-fuelled shopping spree at Gatwick. Beguiling though all this stuff is, there is a point where tomato-print sundresses and sandals with ric-rac lacing stop looking delightfully Dolce, and start looking a tiny bit overwrought. Take a deep breath and put those fringed palazzo pants down. Think loose trousers or shorts, T-shirts or linen shirts, boat shoes or Birkenstocks. No perky sundresses or bedazzling sandals The holiday wardrobe is now as relentlessly marketed in summer as baubles at Christmas and roses on Valentine's Day. The powers that be have figured out that “holiday” is a magic word when it comes to unlocking our purse strings. You can be sensible the rest of the year, but holidays are all about the treats, right? Yes, you absolutely do deserve a treat. I'm on your side here, believe me. It is precisely because I am an absolute sucker for the chic Provençal promise of yet another straw basket that I am getting a bit fed up with how much the holiday glamour industrial complex takes out of my salary. So I'm trying to take the rosé-tinted sunglasses off and remember that living my best life is not actually the same thing as bankrupting myself on loads of gaudy tat. Also, the style tide is turning. I've been to a few fashion shows in the south of France and Italy in the past few months (I know, hard life), which provide excellent opportunities for close study of what fashiony people wear when it's hot. And while long, dramatic dresses and slick tailoring are still pulled out of the bag for fancy evenings, the daytime and travelling looks are distinctly low-key. Think loose trousers or shorts, T-shirts or linen shirts, boat shoes or Birkenstocks. No perky sundresses, no bright co-ords, no bedazzling sandals. The name for this deliberately low-key look? Bore-core. But here's the thing. In the sea of sunny pastels and jaunty polka dots that is the airside Pret queue, it is the traveller in sleek, muted neutrals who stands out. Of course, it has to be done well to work. Good quality fabric is key – but investing in quality linen or Supima cotton makes sense when the pieces you are buying will unpack straight from your holiday suitcase to your home wardrobe. To build this look, start with separates. You want soft tailoring, not athleisure. Look for shorts and trousers with belt loops – a belt adds sophistication without looking fussy – sleek tank tops as a bottom layer, and breezy collared shirts that can be buttoned up smartly or worn open as a beach cover-up. Keep everything in neutrals, but within that, tonal shades are good – not too matchy-matchy. But we still want to feel special, right? As soon as M&S online was back, I snapped up their gold flat sandals (£29.50), which have a comfy adjustable slingback. They are a soft metallic, so easy to wear all day, but glam enough to create a holiday-dinner look with the simplest black dress. As well as gold, I'm backing pale pink as a neutral. Cos has a slim linen waistcoat (£135), which fastens with one button and is in a colour they call apricot, that would make a great travel-day layer but will also work at home. Going on holiday is exciting, but our clothes don't have to be. Model: Amaka at Milk. Styling: Hair and makeup: Sophie Higginson using Sam McKnight and Charlotte Tilbury. Blazer, £198, Reiss.

This is why my most favourite ever handbag is one that lets me explore the world hands-free and worry-free, adding a sense of freedom to my journeys. Never one to gatekeep, I am delighted to see that my beloved Kipling Alvar Medium Crossbody Bag can now be snapped up for with a whopping 60% off - reduced from £83 to £30.50. Available in a range of colours and designs, my Alvar bag has been my trusted friend on urban adventures in the USA, laid back beach holidays in Europe, days out, camping trips, festivals and more. Glued to my side whenever I am getting ready to jet off, I purchased the bag in black almost seven years ago and it's still going strong. Made from Kipling's signature water-resistant crinkled nylon fabric and this little beauty features multiple zippered compartments, to keep your gear safe on the go. With an adjustable strap I can wear it in multiple ways and the medium-sized handbag has a slim, stylish design that complements any outfit. Despite its relaxed look and unobtrusive size, this bag would give the Tardis a run for its money when it comes to storage space. It boasts three zippered exterior pockets for easy access to frequently used items, while the main compartment is cleverly divided in the middle, keeping all other essentials organized and eliminating the hassle of rummaging around. Inside, there are four more pockets, one zippered and three drop pockets to neatly store smaller items. Selected Alvar bags also come with Kipling's signature monkey keychain, making it instantly recognisable to fellow fans of the brand. If you are looking for something a little larger, Amazon has also dropped the price of the Kipling ART Medium Tote Bag from £98 to £41.90. For anyone who doesn't love the Kipling Alvar quite as much as me, Next is selling at Black Washed Messenger Bag for £24. A nice blend of fashion and function, buyers have called the bag with a big front zipper a ""lovely little bag"" that ""fits quite a lot in too."" Elsewhere at Oliver Bonas, the Tiana Black Crossbody Bag has upscale looks and a sleek strap that can be changed out for a fabric strap (available separately). Included in the Summer Sale, the bag is reduced from £54 to £20. Buyers who have already snapped up the Kipling crossbody bag have hailed it as being 'a lovely bag.' One five-star review said: ""Really love this bag. Size is somewhere between a bum bag and cross body bag. Lightweight with loads of pockets. Zips look as if they will last. Usual Kipling quality."" A second buyer added: ""It was everything I'd hoped for and more. Very comfortable even with several items inside. Have used it every day since it arrived."" A third delighted customer was very impressed by the design of the bag. saying: ""Great bag. So many compartments. Doesn't feel heavy no matter how much you put in it. Nice to have extra compartments to separate purse from keys makeup etc. Definitely recommend"" Some buyers however were disappointed that this version of the Alvar does not come with an internal key chain. One buyer left a three-star review that said: ""Needed to replace my old Kipling bag as the strap had frayed. Chose this one particularly because I thought it had an internal key strap/clip like my previous one. However it doesn't which is a real shame and the only reason I marked it down. It would have been perfect otherwise."" Overall, 1567 shoppers gave the £30.50 Kipling bag at five-star review. One bag lover summed it up, exclaiming: ""I have three in different colours, also one larger ( I cannot fault them ) they last forever, zips and material are very strong. Would give more stars if I could.""

mov_CACDE98A79A4563DBE8CBB8A28993C99,2025-07-10 17:48:44,en,WEB,"  You already know that Martha Stewart makes magic in the kitchen, but if you've seen her ""unfiltered"" selfies on Instagram, you might suspect she's up to some sort of wizardry to keep her aging skin looking dewy and moisturized. In the past, the 83-year-old has revealed some of the professional treatments she's received, the at-home face mask she swears by and the tinted sunscreen she relies on. Her skin-care routine isn't exactly cheap, but one affordable product she uses before applying makeup is L'Oreal True Match Lumi Glotion. According to Martha herself, this top-seller helps give her a glowing complexion — and right now it's $11, from $17, for none other than Prime Day. Related: The best moisturizers for aging skin Amazon This multitasker will help give you a lit-from-within look, no matter the time of year. Choose from five shades (prices vary slightly). $11 at Amazon Why is this a good deal? This popular ""glotion"" regularly retails for $17, which is plenty affordable already, especially if you compare it to high-end brands. However, you can save yourself six bucks right now and achieve similar results as the domestic diva — win-win! Why do I need this? On her website, Martha revealed the 14 beauty products she ""swears by,"" and this glow-enhancing priming lotion is near the top of the list. Her trusted makeup artist of many years, Daisy Toye, said she applies it to Martha's face after SPF to add dewiness and create ""a smooth canvas for makeup."" Infused with glycerin and shea butter, the lotion aims to hydrate and moisturize skin while enhancing its natural glow. The multitasker can be worn on its own for a natural look or as a primer under foundation if you prefer more coverage. You can also use it to contour your face by applying it to specific areas. It's available in five shades and can be used on your body too. What reviewers say Martha's not the only one who adores this glowy product — over 34,000 Amazon shoppers have given it their five-star seal of approval. Pros ""I've been using this product for seven months, and I've been complimented almost weekly about how I get my skin to look so dewy and glowy,"" raved one longtime fan. ""I use this all over with a good coverage foundation, and I've never felt/looked so sun-kissed. Such an amazing product for a killer price!"" ""I'm 70 and each time I've worn it, someone has said I looked 'good' or one time I looked 'fresh,'"" shared a content customer. ""This cream adds a subtle shine to your skin. I can barely see it, but it seems to reflect light. I would say people are just being nice, but it has only happened when I've specifically worn this cream."" Others tried it after seeing Martha's seal of approval. ""I heard that this was one of Martha's low-cost beauty secrets ... I've been looking for something that could give me a little sparkle and pop, and this did both,"" said a five-star reviewer. ""Goes on light and has no scent, lasts all day, and I use it with my regular foundation. Love it so much! Gives me a glow that I've been looking for and very natural looking as well!"" Some call this an affordable alternative for Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter — it's just a fraction of the price. ""This really is my favorite stuff in my makeup bag. ... It's a nice subtle glow, but also buildable. Looks good alone or under makeup if you need more coverage. I get compliments every time I wear it alone. It's just beautiful,"" said a fan, adding that they think it's ""better than Charlotte Tilbury. I have both and haven't reached for C.T. since purchasing this."" Cons A few reviewers say they had to pair this lotion with powder or other makeup to tone down the shine. ""I absolutely hate wearing foundation, and this is the perfect substitute,"" said one. ""It still gives me some color but doesn't feel like I have anything on! Only complaint is it does give me a little too much shine on my forehead where I'm already shiny, but some powder on top helps reduce the dew."" A final shopper said they wish the brand carried more shades. ""Medium is very hard to find, so if you see it, grab it,"" they said, adding that their ""only complaint is the limited shade range.""

mov_7DAF10F59CA636211BDB3E8215F35F56,2025-07-11 05:01:00,en,WEB,"  PARIS – Puig is celebrating its more than 110 years of existence with a new book, called “Puig, Home of Creativity.” The 148-page tome published by Rizzoli will be sold in select bookstores starting Sept. 2. It focuses on the legacy, values and brands that comprise the company founded by the Puig family, as well as a snapshot of the group's present and future. “In the last few years we have been forced to talk more about Puig than just the brands that we have under our umbrella,” explained Marc Puig, chairman and chief executive officer of the company. That was particularly true since the group went public in May 2024. “When the 110-year anniversary arrived, we felt that many of the stories and things that had happened over the last decade were worth putting in black and white,” he said, adding this was important for the world — as well as company employees — to see. “It's a good reflection of the essence of who we are,” the executive said. “Puig, Home of Creativity” was fashioned to reflect the company's spirit. It is also meant to complement the book Puig published to mark its centenary, called “Puig, 100 Years of a Family Business.” “The 100-year anniversary was an homage to the second generation,” said Puig. At the time, three of the four of the family members who made that up were still alive. But by today, all of them have passed away. “This book is more a legacy for the next generation, because now we're transitioning, from the family point of view, from the third to the fourth generation,” said Puig. “This book is a platform of where we are going.” The company — with fashion and beauty brands including Rabanne, Carolina Herrera, Dries Van Noten and Jean Paul Gaultier — has been developing strongly. Last year Puig's sales were 4.79 billion euros. Its products are sold in over 150 countries. More in Business Puig has grown its worldwide market share of fragrances from 3 percent to more than 10 percent. “We have been able to, over time, propose ideas that broke the molds,” said Puig, explaining that has been in terms of products and storytelling. “We create the environment for people to be able to grow and take risks. “'Home of Creativity' was a good way to express we are a home, because Puig's culture is based on a family's culture that has [infused] through the organization, where you try to take care of people,” said Puig. “But at the same time, you push the limits, and you try to excel at what you do. It's [also] 'creativity,' because we like to think that we are willing to take risks.” The company's choices over the years that have shaped it into what Puig is today — be it the focus on fragrance or niche brands or own brands — are highlighted in the new book. It opens with a photographic look of Barcelona, home to Puig since its conception, and traces the group's evolution until today, when the company is a premium beauty and fashion powerhouse with fragrance, makeup and skin care. There's a dive into the Puig family's history, the company's values and creative partnerships, as well as the thinking behind its brands. This is sprung to life with contributions from the likes of perfume historian Michael Edwards and perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena, images from the archives and newly commissioned photographs. Fourteen of the brands are highlighted, including Rabanne and its iconic metallic chain-mail dress, plus interviews with Charlotte Tilbury, Jean Paul Gaultier and Dries Van Noten, who talks about how his garden has influenced his creative world. A section describes Wes Gordon's succeeding Herrera at her eponymous brand. There is also a spotlight on Uriage's history, among other notable brand moments. Edwards penned a section about the rise of niche fragrances, which are important strategically for Puig, which has brands such as Penhaligon's, L'Artisan Parfumeur and Byredo. Puig's globetrotting is highlighted, as is its product development. With a deep sailing history, a major moment came last year, with the first Puig Women's America's Cup. Puig, on the behalf of his family, asked Ellena to create four colognes in memory of Antonio Puig, who founded the house. “Historically, we had some products that had the Puig family name that we were very proud of and over time they have been disappearing,” said Puig. “We wanted to make an homage to the name and to some of the inspirations for those products that at some point really shaped who we were as a company.” The exercise made the family proud, according to Puig. “There's always the question that you have to ask yourself: What makes that brand or company's personality, its value system? What's the essence that differentiates that company?” said Puig. “What are the characteristics of this company that the family has shaped that we want to maintain?” Change is of the essence. If one stays still, they fall — like in bicycle riding, he said. “But you also have to decide what it is that we want to keep evolving and changing, so that this company can survive and excel going forward,” added Puig. “Creating this book is a long and ambitious process,” said Catherine Bonifassi, editorial director of Rizzoli New York, in a statement. “During this journey, as an editor, you truly get to see the personality of the people you work with, as you are facing together challenges, surprises, creative decisions…, exchanges that reveal the real values of a brand and its people's creativity, openness, commitment and boldness.” “Puig, Home of Creativity” can be pre-ordered on rizzoliusa.com."

Und das ist das Lippenöl Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil Strawberry Vanilla! Inhalt: Das Lippenöl enthält hydratisierenden Hyaluronsäure sowie antioxidantreichen Fruchtöle um feine Linien zu glätten und für pralle Lippen zu sorgen. Der Appliktor ist extra gebogen, so dass er mühelos über die Lippen gleitet. Verpackung/Design: Das Lippenöl ist einer rosafarbenen Schachtel verpackt. Auf dieser sind schon passend zum Duft Erdbeeren abgebildet! Nach dem Auspacken hält man eine rosafarbene Tube in der Hand. Darauf sind auch Erdbeeren sowie Lippen abgebildet mit einer goldenen Kappe. Ich finde das Design total schön und ansprechend gestaltet! Duft: Zuerst musste ich natürlich schnuppern: der Duft ist etwas süßlich, es duftet nach Erdbeere, nur Vanille kann ich nicht so heraus riechen. Für mich duftet es ein bisschen wie nach einer leckeren Erdbeertorte. Ich könnte das Lippenöl glatt vernaschen! Anwendung: Durch den gebogenen Applikator lässt sich das Lippenöl viel besser auf meinen Lippen auftragen und verteilen! Ergebnis: Das Lippenöl hat nur einen sehr leichten rötlichen Farbton, aber es sorgt für einen schönen Glanz. Und meine Lippen wirken auch voller! Meine Lippen fühlen sich schön weich und geschmeidig an. Sie sind auch nicht mehr so trocken. Das Lippenöl ist schließlich gleichzeitig auch eine gute Lippenpflege! Die Haltbarkeit ist richtig gut: nach dem Auftragen habe ich ein paar Mal was getrunken und das weiche Gefühl des Lippenöls blieb! Auch fast eine ganze Mahlzeit hielt das Lippenöl durch. Mein Fazit: Ich bin total verliebt in das neue Lippenöl von Charlotte Tilbury. Der Erdbeerduft ist himmlisch schön und das Lippenöl hält unglaublich lange! Noch ein Tipp von mir: Lippenöl in den Kühlschrank legen, dann wird es zum Frischekick! #complimentary #unreallipoil #charlottetilbury #produkttest #produktetesten #produkttesterin #produkttesterinmitherz #blogger #instablogger #instatester #testblogger #testenprodukt #werbung #testen #testerin #producttesting  #tester"

1ly65yb,2025-07-12 17:34:20,en,REDDIT,"  I am 12 years old and almost a teenager. i see beauty gurus on youtube talk about charlotte tilbury and fenty lip products, what i also see on youtube are 10 year olds at sephora, and comedic parodies about how insufferable they are(i am aware that some products are harmful to children's skin barriers, and beauty standards/social media are producing a generation of insecure women). im getting pretty interested in beauty and self care and i want to get something for myself- maybe some highlighter. but im scared of being like one of those ten-years olds, technically i am in the same phase in my life as them and only 2 years older. i have always considered myself to be some what of a tomboy, and have been taught to demonize femininity. so i also have some underlying hesitation on what to get for myself. and i understand that im in a period of my life where i feel like the ugliest person alive. so if i get something, do i fall into the category of sephora kids? also-any beauty tips for sensitive skin?"
