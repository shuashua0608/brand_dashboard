mov_88CD34212554CC2F131F5ADBD6AFD7FB,"  PAU BARRENA // AFP via If you are working in influencer marketing, you must have heard of the new buzzword: AI influencers. AI influencers, also known as virtual influencers, are quickly becoming one of the most talked-about trends in the influencer marketing world. These digital personalities, often powered by AI and CGI, can look and behave like real people. Some are animated or stylized, while others are nearly indistinguishable from humans. While AI influencers won't replace human creators, they are changing the game, offering new opportunities for creative campaigns, brand storytelling, and customer interaction. Understanding how to work with these digital personas is key for marketers who want to stay ahead of the curve. In this article, CreatorDB explores the evolution of AI influencers, why they're gaining popularity, how leading brands are using them, and what this trend means for the future of influencer marketing. What Are AI Influencers? AI influencers are digital personas created using AI tools and CGI. They behave like human influencers, posting content, engaging with followers, and partnering with brands, but they are not real people. Some are managed by agencies, while others are entirely autonomous with AI-generated visuals and personalities. According to The Conversation, there are three main types of AI influencers: Non-Humans – Characters that are clearly fictional (e.g., mascots). Animated Humans – Stylized or cartoon-like personas. Hyper-Realistic CGI Humans – Nearly indistinguishable from real people. Some of the most well-known examples include: LilMiquela – Fashion and music influencer with over 2.7 million followers. Imma – A Japanese virtual model with a highly engaged following. Kuki – An interactive chatbot with a social media presence. A Brief History of Virtual Influencers The concept of AI influencers first came out in the early 2010s. Back then, the early versions of AI influencers were simply virtual characters in the gaming and entertainment industry. As AI and computer graphics developed, these characters started to have more nuances and became more sophisticated, eventually becoming the virtual influencers we see today. In 2016, the world welcomed Lil Miquela, who is considered the first official hyperrealistic AI influencer in history. After her release, there were a ton of debates about whether she was a real person or not. Since then, the virtual influencer industry has exploded: CB from Casa Bahia – A Brazilian virtual mascot with over 10M followers. Milla Sofia – An AI-generated influencer using diffusion models. Brand-created influencers – From Lu of Magalu to Noonoouri, companies are building and managing their own digital ambassadors. Why Are Brands Turning to AI Influencers? Though still niche, AI influencers appeal to brands for several compelling reasons: Total control over content, messaging, and brand representation No scandals or PR risks, unlike human influencers Always available for campaigns and engagement Cost-effective over time High novelty value, boosting brand buzz and attention Besides those reasons, according to Influencer Marketing Hub data, AI influencers are collecting excellent feedback from the marketers who worked with them and inspiring more collaborations: 59.8% of marketing professionals have worked with AI influencers 15.5% plan to collaborate with AI influencers Over 60% of those who once collaborated with virtual influencers are satisfied. Since AI influencers don't exist as people outside of their social media feeds, a team of professionals manages them, making it easier to align them with the specifics of a marketing campaign. CreatorDB Case Studies: How Brands Are Using AI Influencers Although there is still no data about how effective AI influencers are compared to traditional influencers, it is clear that the fit with the product is still the most critical factor for a successful influencer marketing campaign. Audiences might be happy to see the innovation of AI influencers, but they may find human influencers more relatable regarding certain products. Still, AI influencers are great if brands want to showcase an innovative image and position themselves at the forefront of a trend.

Titled Moncler x Gilga Farm, the collection reinterprets Moncler's alpine heritage through a Californian lens, blending the brand's mountain wear DNA with Glover's focus on functionality, comfort and everyday usefulness. The collection includes quilted jackets, technical linen canvas, wool-cashmere knits, lightweight ripstop windbreakers and a standout burnt orange suede jacket. Other key pieces include oversized workwear-inspired layers, shorts, cotton tees and a convertible duvet jacket that transforms into a sleeping bag — a reference to Moncler's original sleeping bag product. The pieces are designed to be wearable in transitional weather, balancing practicality with relaxed style. Colorways are inspired by the Ojai Valley landscape and Gilga Farm's surroundings, featuring washed pinks, creams, oranges and pale blues. Natural-feel fabrics are used throughout and orange fiber — a nod to Gilga's citrus groves — is woven into select garments. The orange also appears as a recurring motif in logos and design accents. Footwear includes a simplified version of the Moncler Trailgrip Vela sandal, made from cotton ribbon and leather and finished with a pale pink Vibram sole. The collaboration also introduces playful design elements, including patches, comic strip graphics and a reimagined version of Moncler's Monduck mascot, shown as a farmer character across the collection. Animated care labels — voiced by Glover — reference the Monduck tag found in his first Moncler jacket, blending personal storytelling with brand heritage. “Functionality is key — it's something that connects the world of Gilga and Moncler,” Glover said of the collaboration. “We both create for real-world usefulness.” The campaign features a short animated film in which a cartoon version of Glover falls asleep at Gilga Farm and dreams of a Moncler alpine landscape, illustrating the merging of both worlds. Moncler x Gilga Farm is available now at select Moncler locations and online at moncler.com. A new book and exhibit explore Christian Dior's floral inspiration A new book titled “Dior Enchanting Gardens” explores the central role that nature, gardens and flowers have played in the creative universe of Christian Dior and the legacy of the house he founded. Published by Rizzoli, the volume traces Dior's lifelong fascination with the natural world, which began in his childhood home, Villa Les Rhumbs in Granville, and extended to other private residences including the Château de La Colle Noire in Montauroux and the Moulin du Coudret in Milly-la-Forêt. These locations and their gardens are presented chapter by chapter, offering insight into how they influenced both Dior's personal life and creative output. Flowers were a key inspiration for Dior from the start — notably in his 1947 New Look collection, which featured the Corolle line, and in the creation of Miss Dior, his first fragrance. The book connects these early inspirations to the work of Dior's artistic successors, including Maria Grazia Chiuri, showing how floral motifs have remained a defining element of the brand's aesthetic through decades of couture and fragrance design. Alongside text contributions, the book features rare archival documents and photographs by leading fashion photographers such as Henry Clarke, Patrick Demarchelier, Brigitte Niedermair and Paolo Roversi. Garments are shown alongside Dior's most iconic fragrances in a visual and historical survey that spans from the original femme-fleur silhouette to contemporary designs. “Dior Enchanting Gardens” includes a preface by Jean-Paul Claverie, an introduction by Brigitte Richart and essays by contributors including Philippe Deliau, Amy de La Haye, Vincent Leret, Barbara Jeauffroy-Mairet and Coline Zellal. The book is a companion to the exhibition of the same name, running at the Musée Christian Dior in Granville, France through Nov. 2. “Synth II” by Kevin Beasley (Source: Regen Projects) Regen Projects presents Kevin Beasley's “What delineates the edge” Artist Kevin Beasley returns to Regen Projects this summer with “What delineates the edge,” his second solo exhibition at the gallery. Known for his sculptural work that fuses found materials with experimental processes, Beasley continues his exploration of memory, materiality and spatial form through a new series of wall-mounted slabs and freestanding sculptures. The exhibition centers on the idea of thresholds — both literal and metaphorical — bringing together personal and cultural references. Using his signature cast resin technique, Beasley incorporates objects such as bedsheets, military uniforms, hats, carbon fiber, denim and shoes into sculptural screens that function like movable partitions. These works act as armatures for meaning, creating porous, layered boundaries that invite viewers to navigate the space through improvisation. Also on view are Beasley's “Synths” — large resin panels embedded with items like raw cotton, chipped pool cues, PPE components and T-shirts. The compositions reference both Beasley's personal history growing up in Virginia and broader cultural narratives, with the materials sometimes clearly visible and other times obscured. The title, drawn from musical synthesizers, reflects the work's aim to translate memory and emotion into visual form. The show follows Beasley's recent large-scale installation at Storm King Art Center and recent exhibitions at the Walker Art Center and the 15th Gwangju Biennale. His work is held in major public collections including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Tate Modern in London and the Art Institute of Chicago. “What delineates the edge” is on view at Regen Projects, 6750 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90038, from July 2 to Aug. 16. Reformation x StyledSara debut the Sara Linen Dress Reformation, the cult-favorite Los Angeles label known for its effortlessly feminine silhouettes and commitment to sustainability, has launched a new collaboration with stylist and fashion consultant Sara Walker. The Sara Linen Dress is a ladylike midi crafted from 100% linen, complete with scalloped trim and buckle details that channel Walker's deep archive of fashion references. “I designed a piece that feels effortless and flattering, but still packed with personality,” she said. “The scalloped trim was inspired by a 1960s fashion magazine I've kept for years, and the buckle details are a subtle wink to a '90s runway moment I've never forgotten.” The dress will be available in three distinct colorways: Stampede, a chocolate brown zebra print; Nectarine, a coral-and-orange colorblock; and Parmesan, a soft yellow with crisp white accents. To celebrate the launch, Walker hosted an intimate lunch at the Chateau Marmont earlier this month. Guests including Tezza, Angela Fink, Gab Waller and Liv Perez all wore the new design, styled their own way — a fitting tribute to Reformation's blend of timeless appeal and individual expression.

The book is a companion to the exhibition of the same name, running at the in Granville, France through Nov. 2. Regen Projects presents Kevin Beasley's “What delineates the edge” Artist Kevin Beasley returns to this summer with “What delineates the edge,” his second solo exhibition at the gallery. Known for his sculptural work that fuses found materials with experimental processes, Beasley continues his exploration of memory, materiality and spatial form through a new series of wall-mounted slabs and freestanding sculptures. The exhibition centers on the idea of thresholds — both literal and metaphorical — bringing together personal and cultural references. Using his signature cast resin technique, Beasley incorporates objects such as bedsheets, military uniforms, hats, carbon fiber, denim and shoes into sculptural screens that function like movable partitions. These works act as armatures for meaning, creating porous, layered boundaries that invite viewers to navigate the space through improvisation. Also on view are Beasley's “Synths” — large resin panels embedded with items like raw cotton, chipped pool cues, PPE components and T-shirts. The compositions reference both Beasley's personal history growing up in Virginia and broader cultural narratives, with the materials sometimes clearly visible and other times obscured. The title, drawn from musical synthesizers, reflects the work's aim to translate memory and emotion into visual form. The show follows Beasley's recent large-scale installation at Storm King Art Center and recent exhibitions at the Walker Art Center and the 15th Gwangju Biennale. His work is held in major public collections including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Tate Modern in London and the Art Institute of Chicago. “What delineates the edge” is on view at Regen Projects, 6750 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90038, from July 2 to Aug. 16. Reformation x StyledSara debut the Sara Linen Dress , the cult-favorite Los Angeles label known for its effortlessly feminine silhouettes and commitment to sustainability, has launched a new collaboration with stylist and fashion consultant . The Sara Linen Dress is a ladylike midi crafted from 100% linen, complete with scalloped trim and buckle details that channel Walker's deep archive of fashion references. “I designed a piece that feels effortless and flattering, but still packed with personality,” she said. “The scalloped trim was inspired by a 1960s fashion magazine I've kept for years, and the buckle details are a subtle wink to a '90s runway moment I've never forgotten.” The dress will be available in three distinct colorways: Stampede, a chocolate brown zebra print; Nectarine, a coral-and-orange colorblock; and Parmesan, a soft yellow with crisp white accents. To celebrate the launch, Walker hosted an intimate lunch at the Chateau Marmont earlier this month. Guests including Tezza, Angela Fink, Gab Waller and Liv Perez all wore the new design, styled their own way — a fitting tribute to Reformation's blend of timeless appeal and individual expression. This collaboration follows a string of successful partnerships for the brand, which has previously teamed up with fashion and culture tastemakers like Kacey Musgraves, Devon Lee Carlson and Laura Harrier. Priced at $278 USD, it's available now and in Reformation stores nationwide—each boutique carrying one exclusive colorway.

Titled Moncler x Gilga Farm, the collection reinterprets Moncler's alpine heritage through a Californian lens, blending the brand's mountain wear DNA with Glover's focus on functionality, comfort and everyday usefulness. The collection includes quilted jackets, technical linen canvas, wool-cashmere knits, lightweight ripstop windbreakers and a standout burnt orange suede jacket. Other key pieces include oversized workwear-inspired layers, shorts, cotton tees and a convertible duvet jacket that transforms into a sleeping bag — a reference to Moncler's original sleeping bag product. The pieces are designed to be wearable in transitional weather, balancing practicality with relaxed style. Colorways are inspired by the Ojai Valley landscape and Gilga Farm's surroundings, featuring washed pinks, creams, oranges and pale blues. Natural-feel fabrics are used throughout and orange fiber — a nod to Gilga's citrus groves — is woven into select garments. The orange also appears as a recurring motif in logos and design accents. Footwear includes a simplified version of the Moncler Trailgrip Vela sandal, made from cotton ribbon and leather and finished with a pale pink Vibram sole. The collaboration also introduces playful design elements, including patches, comic strip graphics and a reimagined version of Moncler's Monduck mascot, shown as a farmer character across the collection. Animated care labels — voiced by Glover — reference the Monduck tag found in his first Moncler jacket, blending personal storytelling with brand heritage. “Functionality is key — it's something that connects the world of Gilga and Moncler,” Glover said of the collaboration. “We both create for real-world usefulness.” The campaign features a short animated film in which a cartoon version of Glover falls asleep at Gilga Farm and dreams of a Moncler alpine landscape, illustrating the merging of both worlds. Moncler x Gilga Farm is available now at select Moncler locations and online at moncler.com.

mov_46F883177BC5A60D12E9AB73F6271E09,"  PAU BARRENA // AFP via If you are working in influencer marketing, you must have heard of the new buzzword: AI influencers. AI influencers, also known as virtual influencers, are quickly becoming one of the most talked-about trends in the influencer marketing world. These digital personalities, often powered by AI and CGI, can look and behave like real people. Some are animated or stylized, while others are nearly indistinguishable from humans. While AI influencers won't replace human creators, they are changing the game, offering new opportunities for creative campaigns, brand storytelling, and customer interaction. Understanding how to work with these digital personas is key for marketers who want to stay ahead of the curve. In this article, CreatorDB explores the evolution of AI influencers, why they're gaining popularity, how leading brands are using them, and what this trend means for the future of influencer marketing. What Are AI Influencers? AI influencers are digital personas created using AI tools and CGI. They behave like human influencers, posting content, engaging with followers, and partnering with brands, but they are not real people. Some are managed by agencies, while others are entirely autonomous with AI-generated visuals and personalities. According to The Conversation, there are three main types of AI influencers: Non-Humans – Characters that are clearly fictional (e.g., mascots). Animated Humans – Stylized or cartoon-like personas. Hyper-Realistic CGI Humans – Nearly indistinguishable from real people. Some of the most well-known examples include: LilMiquela – Fashion and music influencer with over 2.7 million followers. Imma – A Japanese virtual model with a highly engaged following. Kuki – An interactive chatbot with a social media presence. A Brief History of Virtual Influencers The concept of AI influencers first came out in the early 2010s. Back then, the early versions of AI influencers were simply virtual characters in the gaming and entertainment industry. As AI and computer graphics developed, these characters started to have more nuances and became more sophisticated, eventually becoming the virtual influencers we see today. In 2016, the world welcomed Lil Miquela, who is considered the first official hyperrealistic AI influencer in history. After her release, there were a ton of debates about whether she was a real person or not. Since then, the virtual influencer industry has exploded: CB from Casa Bahia – A Brazilian virtual mascot with over 10M followers. Milla Sofia – An AI-generated influencer using diffusion models. Brand-created influencers – From Lu of Magalu to Noonoouri, companies are building and managing their own digital ambassadors. Why Are Brands Turning to AI Influencers? Though still niche, AI influencers appeal to brands for several compelling reasons: Total control over content, messaging, and brand representation No scandals or PR risks, unlike human influencers Always available for campaigns and engagement Cost-effective over time High novelty value, boosting brand buzz and attention Besides those reasons, according to Influencer Marketing Hub data, AI influencers are collecting excellent feedback from the marketers who worked with them and inspiring more collaborations: 59.8% of marketing professionals have worked with AI influencers 15.5% plan to collaborate with AI influencers Over 60% of those who once collaborated with virtual influencers are satisfied. Since AI influencers don't exist as people outside of their social media feeds, a team of professionals manages them, making it easier to align them with the specifics of a marketing campaign. CreatorDB Case Studies: How Brands Are Using AI Influencers Although there is still no data about how effective AI influencers are compared to traditional influencers, it is clear that the fit with the product is still the most critical factor for a successful influencer marketing campaign. Audiences might be happy to see the innovation of AI influencers, but they may find human influencers more relatable regarding certain products. Still, AI influencers are great if brands want to showcase an innovative image and position themselves at the forefront of a trend.

mov_CD4B895F5FB306DE6819E2D4D0916116,"  If you are working in influencer marketing, you must have heard of the new buzzword: AI influencers. AI influencers, also known as virtual influencers, are quickly becoming one of the most talked-about trends in the influencer marketing world. These digital personalities, often powered by AI and CGI, can look and behave like real people. Some are animated or stylized, while others are nearly indistinguishable from humans. While AI influencers won't replace human creators, they are changing the game, offering new opportunities for creative campaigns, brand storytelling, and customer interaction. Understanding how to work with these digital personas is key for marketers who want to stay ahead of the curve. In this article, CreatorDB explores the evolution of AI influencers, why they're gaining popularity, how leading brands are using them, and what this trend means for the future of influencer marketing. What Are AI Influencers? AI influencers are digital personas created using AI tools and CGI. They behave like human influencers, posting content, engaging with followers, and partnering with brands, but they are not real people. Some are managed by agencies, while others are entirely autonomous with AI-generated visuals and personalities. According to The Conversation, there are three main types of AI influencers: Non-Humans – Characters that are clearly fictional (e.g., mascots). Animated Humans – Stylized or cartoon-like personas. Hyper-Realistic CGI Humans – Nearly indistinguishable from real people. Some of the most well-known examples include: LilMiquela – Fashion and music influencer with over 2.7 million followers. Imma – A Japanese virtual model with a highly engaged following. Kuki – An interactive chatbot with a social media presence. A Brief History of Virtual Influencers The concept of AI influencers first came out in the early 2010s. Back then, the early versions of AI influencers were simply virtual characters in the gaming and entertainment industry. As AI and computer graphics developed, these characters started to have more nuances and became more sophisticated, eventually becoming the virtual influencers we see today. In 2016, the world welcomed Lil Miquela, who is considered the first official hyperrealistic AI influencer in history. After her release, there were a ton of debates about whether she was a real person or not. Since then, the virtual influencer industry has exploded: CB from Casa Bahia – A Brazilian virtual mascot with over 10M followers. Milla Sofia – An AI-generated influencer using diffusion models. Brand-created influencers – From Lu of Magalu to Noonoouri, companies are building and managing their own digital ambassadors. Why Are Brands Turning to AI Influencers? Though still niche, AI influencers appeal to brands for several compelling reasons: Total control over content, messaging, and brand representation No scandals or PR risks, unlike human influencers Always available for campaigns and engagement Cost-effective over time High novelty value, boosting brand buzz and attention Besides those reasons, according to Influencer Marketing Hub data, AI influencers are collecting excellent feedback from the marketers who worked with them and inspiring more collaborations: 59.8% of marketing professionals have worked with AI influencers 15.5% plan to collaborate with AI influencers Over 60% of those who once collaborated with virtual influencers are satisfied. Since AI influencers don't exist as people outside of their social media feeds, a team of professionals manages them, making it easier to align them with the specifics of a marketing campaign. Case Studies: How Brands Are Using AI Influencers Although there is still no data about how effective AI influencers are compared to traditional influencers, it is clear that the fit with the product is still the most critical factor for a successful influencer marketing campaign. Audiences might be happy to see the innovation of AI influencers, but they may find human influencers more relatable regarding certain products. Still, AI influencers are great if brands want to showcase an innovative image and position themselves at the forefront of a trend. CreatorDB found three case studies in different industries to help you better understand how to work with AI influencers. 1. Hugo Boss Rebranding: Rebranding With Imma and Nobody Sausage In the spring of 2022, the German fashion brand Hugo Boss underwent a major rebranding effort to reach the younger generations.

 記得去年跟姜濤訪談，當時我們聊到他為新作品系列的部署，這次再遇上他時正好就是作品陸續推出的時候。 本年已經推出了兩首，分別是〈白果〉及〈On A SunnyDay〉。 〈On A SunnyDay〉是一首生日主題的歌曲，關於概念他解釋說：「很感謝大家，這幾年來都溫暖的跟我慶祝生日！ 相比以前也沒有甚麼朋友跟我慶祝，也沒有舉行過生日會，一般都是跟家人慶祝的，而現在這麼多人一起跟我慶祝，讓我想起也許世界上有其他人會在生日的時候因為沒有人跟他慶祝而感到孤單，希望可以透過這首歌將生日的喜悅跟大家分享。」 粉絲們跟他慶祝非常有心思，本年就在生日會上放煙火，所有看到的人也必然感受到大家對他的愛的熾熱。 說到今年大概還有三至四首歌推出，在他正一步一步地做好每一首歌時，他說起創作上的想法，「今年的歌會有一個概念連貫整年，曲風上會有些不同，但也不是特別去想要甚麼新的嘗試，單純希望唱好一首歌。 很多時候，為了去嘗試新的東西，很容易會忽略最基本的東西沒有做到好。 這樣的狀況，不止是單純說我唱歌，放諸於任何行業也一樣吧。」 工作上的真實時刻
 說到作品，問姜濤如果要在作品中選出四至五首，他會選哪些？ 他想了一想，說：「〈鏡中鏡〉、〈濤〉、〈Master Class〉、〈蒙著嘴說愛你〉、〈孤獨病〉及〈作品說的話〉。」 他輕輕的解釋起來，「〈濤〉是我演唱會的主題曲，代表了整個演唱會的概念，而且用了自己的名字來做歌名，頗有意義。 〈鏡中鏡〉雖然有點爭議，但我覺得這首歌從製作到歌詞各方面都做得很出色。 〈作品說的話〉是我製作的歌曲中的音樂錄像拍攝費最貴也最大規模的。 這些歌就在描述一個故事，代表我不同時期的想法。」 由作品的論述，說到演出，他說：「我是一個不太喜歡每一次演出都表演同一樣東西的人，會覺得很悶。 不過，如果大家會很喜歡我唱某一首歌，我也會唱給大家聽。 試過是粉絲或者有情緒病的人說因為我的歌而心情舒服一點，也試過一次乘坐的士時司機跟我說起我的歌給了他一些能量，我覺得如果我的歌能夠幫助到大家，能夠讓大家開心一點，我也會因此感到很快樂。」 話題漸漸轉到工作，以及參加跟籃球有關的工作活動時，他微笑說：「工作上突然有活動需要打籃球會覺得很開心，打籃球最享受的是可以感受到大家心裡的那團火，而打波的過程大家好直接，在場與隊友的配合靠直覺，是默契。 我跟朋友有一起訓練，練習後也會討論如何可以打得好一點。 平時，看完NBA重播也會跟朋友討論賽果。」 溫暖的光輝
 姜濤露出燦爛笑容的當下，我們正談到了旅行。 他說起了上次跟家人去了歐洲半個月的歡樂時光。 「旅程真的很棒！ 很多時候，當我在旅途上看到甚麼都很想跟家人分享，而這一次帶著家人及親戚去了英國及法國，看到他們站在巴黎街頭非常滿足的神情，就是我最有滿足感的時候。 那次之後，我們也去了美國及日本旅行。」 問他喜歡放長假還是短短幾天的假期，他大笑起來說：「長假！ 不過，又不能放假放太久，不然放假後回歸工作又會不習慣，放兩三星期的假期是最適中最好的。」 「我覺得，去旅行的目的性不要太強，最好可以轉變一種生活方式去感受當地的生活，不要像遊客般走馬看花，這樣就看不到那個地方的真正面貌。 我很喜歡在街上漫步，感受那個地方的氛圍。 而且，在香港很難可以無拘束地四處漫步，因此旅行確實可以讓人放鬆心情。」 忍不住問他，那他偏好寒冷的還是炎熱的地方，「喜歡偏冷的地方，滑雪也是我其中一樣想找機會學學的技能。 最後問他，生活裡最享受的時刻是怎樣？ 他大笑起來，說：「哈哈哈哈，下班的時候。」 好的，我們就此完成訪談，看著他帶笑的離開，讓他享受最享受的完成工作手工的時候吧。 photo by LEUNGMO

mov_D21CAF17E6D88B4C61502E34F9616CDD,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Với hơn 219.000 mặt hàng giả được thu giữ và tổng giá trị thị trường nếu bán ra tương đương hàng thật lên tới 1,03 tỷ USD, vụ việc được đánh giá là một trong những vụ án hàng giả lớn nhất lịch sử nước Mỹ. Hai nghi phạm, một đế chế hàng giả trị giá tỷ đô Ẩn mình giữa những dãy nhà cao tầng sầm uất của Manhattan, một mạng lưới buôn bán hàng hiệu giả tinh vi đã tồn tại và vận hành âm thầm trong nhiều năm. Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản. Nguồn: Tổng hợp","SPR_COMBO[vi]Với hơn 219.000 mặt hàng giả được thu giữ và tổng giá trị thị trường nếu bán ra tương đương hàng thật lên tới 1,03 tỷ USD, vụ việc được đánh giá là một trong những vụ án hàng giả lớn nhất lịch sử nước Mỹ. Hai nghi phạm, một đế chế hàng giả trị giá tỷ đô Ẩn mình giữa những dãy nhà cao tầng sầm uất của Manhattan, một mạng lưới buôn bán hàng hiệu giả tinh vi đã tồn tại và vận hành âm thầm trong nhiều năm. Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra.

mov_FF4881AB674D2F15DFA9581019DA4BC0,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Hai nghi phạm, một đế chế hàng giả trị giá tỷ đô Ẩn mình giữa những dãy nhà cao tầng sầm uất của Manhattan, một mạng lưới buôn bán hàng hiệu giả tinh vi đã tồn tại và vận hành âm thầm trong nhiều năm. Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản.

She apologized for being last minute, but said she was eloping soon and needed to purchase something off the rack for the occasion. No problem, fairly common request nowadays with elopements being so popular. When I brought her to the rack she immediately steered towards our vintage line, picking out a classic Dior which everyone admired but left alone due to the cost. “Cost isn't a factor.” , she said, tracing the lace with her fingertips. I liked her already. She insisted to get dressed alone, and I obliged. I continued my busy work until she stepped out of the dressing room. I normally go through the same script in my head when a bride comes out in a dress. “Oh! Stunning! Your groom is a lucky man, he will cry when he sees your beauty!” But now. . I was speechless. She truly was the most beautiful bride I had ever seen. She sparkled, twirled, admired her reflection. “Oh this dress!” , she squealed, “I don't need to see anything else, I'll take this one!” “Perfect!” , I clasped my hands together, “Go ahead and get changed and we will get this rang up for you, it's truly your perfect dress!” She smiled at me, tears welled up in her eyes, and she turned and went behind the curtain to change. I was humming to myself at the register, thinking about what vacation I could book with the commission, when I noticed. . she's been changing for a while. At least 15 minutes. I walked up to the curtain. “Miss?” No answer. “Miss? Do you need help?...","I call her Betty. I let her be. I've been selling wedding dresses for 5 years, and I won't lie to you. I'm great at it. I can spot the style the bride wants the second they walk through the door, my monthly commission is more than double what my coworkers bring home, and I'm content doing what I love. The only downside, is Betty. Our dress shop is iconic. In a historic town that used to house stars from the Golden Age. In the 50s we sold evening wear, but nowadays we mainly do bridal, and some custom orders. I was closing the shop alone one night when I first met Betty.

295ee225fd970e43afc0c6eafae59ece,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Hai nghi phạm, một đế chế hàng giả trị giá tỷ đô Ẩn mình giữa những dãy nhà cao tầng sầm uất của Manhattan, một mạng lưới buôn bán hàng hiệu giả tinh vi đã tồn tại và vận hành âm thầm trong nhiều năm. Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản.

mov_BC8F25DB0697D1D97460723FD7836060,"  On July 1, 2025, @ArtOfDialogue_ posted a video showing rapper Remy Ma in a verbal altercation with Jazmin Dior, the daughter of her son Jayson Scott's alleged murder victim, outside a courthouse. As reported by NBC News, Remy's son, Jayson Scott, was arrested on charges of first-degree murder in connection with a fatal shooting that occurred in Queens, New York, on June 7, 2021. He was accused of shooting Darius Guillebeaux in Queens and additionally charged with criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment, and second-degree murder. The last known information concerning the charges against Remy's son was a seven-count indictment scheduled for June 25, 2024, alongside his alleged accomplice, Richard Swygert. Both Jayson and Richard were held without bail. ABC7's June 2024 report further noted that if convicted of the top count, Jayson could face life in prison without the possibility of parole. In the now-viral video, Remy Ma is seen recording the victim's daughter while the two engage in a verbal altercation. Jazmin Dior later shared a clip saying that Remy acted like her son was the victim without any remorse, while she can't see her father anymore. Did Remy Ma go to prison? Details explored as daughter of her son's alleged murder victim lashes out In her video calling out Remy Ma's behavior, Jazmin Dior—the daughter of Jayson Scott's alleged murder victim—criticized the rapper for acting tough outside a courthouse, warning that such behavior could land her in jail. Jazmin added that Remy had already been to jail before, questioning if the rapper was trying to go back in with such an attitude. For the unversed, Remy was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2008 after being convicted of criminal possession of a weapon and assault. As reported by Reuters in May 2008, the rapper shot and wounded an acquaintance after discovering that money was missing from her purse following a night out in Manhattan. During sentencing, Criminal Court Judge Rena Uviller described Remy Ma as ""an extremely angry young woman whose anger is completely out of control."" According to the case details, Remy Ma doubted her friend Makeda of taking $3,000 from her. This led to an altercation during which the gun went off while the pair struggled over a purse. The bullet passed through Makeda's colon and hit her rectum, requiring three weeks of hospitalization. Remy's lawyer, Ivan Fisher, defended the rapper by stating that the shooting, which took place on July 14, 2007, was accidental. He claimed the victim, Makeda Barnes-Joseph, put forth an exaggerated claim to acquire a large sum in a separate civil suit. During her appearance on in September 2024, Nick Cannon asked Remy what one thing she would take back in her life if she got the opportunity. Answering the same without hesitation, Remy Ma said: “Not going to prison, ever. The f*ck? Before that, it used to be the worst thing that ever happened was, I got cut in my face… It used to really bother me a lot, and I used to say, this is the worst thing that's ever happened to me."" Apart from the latest controversy, Remy Ma has also made headlines for discussing her separation from Papoose. The former couple married in 2008 while Remy was incarcerated. Papoose filed for divorce in May 2025, citing irreconcilable differences. Feedback Why did you not like this content? Cancel Submit Was this article helpful?

From Dior's intriguing new direction to Hermès' focus on sophisticated city living, and the playful energy of KidSuper, the menswear collections showcased a diverse range of aesthetics. This season wasn't just about clothes; it was about storytelling, cultural references, and a subtle shift towards comfort and practicality without sacrificing elegance. The shows signaled a move beyond strict formality, embracing a more relaxed yet refined approach to menswear. Dior's Artistic Evolution and a Nod to Wes Anderson Kim Jones' latest collection for Dior presented a compelling new chapter for the iconic house. The collection drew heavily from the aesthetic of the zoot suit, a bold and historically significant style. This unexpected inspiration was executed with Dior's signature tailoring and attention to detail, resulting in a collection that felt both fresh and respectful of its roots. Notably, the show featured a distinct visual echo of Wes Anderson's cinematic style – symmetrical staging and a carefully curated color palette – adding a layer of playful intellectualism. CNN provides a detailed look at the show's key moments. Hermès: The Modern Gentleman's Urban Wardrobe Hermès continued its tradition of understated luxury with a collection designed for the modern city dweller. The emphasis was on versatile pieces crafted from high-quality materials, offering a sophisticated yet effortless style. Silhouettes were relaxed and comfortable, prioritizing ease of movement and practicality. The color palette was muted and refined, reflecting a sense of quiet confidence. Nation.com.pk highlights the collection's focus on comfort and ease. Beyond the Big Names: KidSuper and Ziggy Chen Offer Fresh Perspectives While Dior and Hermès dominated headlines, other designers brought unique visions to the Paris runways. KidSuper presented a whimsical, fairytale-inspired collection, injecting a dose of playful creativity into the menswear landscape. Ziggy Chen, on the other hand, focused on lightness and breathability, utilizing linen fabrics to create a relaxed and airy aesthetic. These emerging designers demonstrate the evolving nature of menswear and the growing demand for individuality and self-expression. FashionUnited.uk provides a comprehensive overview of these and other standout shows. What does this shift towards more relaxed and versatile menswear signify for the future of fashion? And how will established houses like Dior continue to balance tradition with innovation? The Broader Trends Shaping Menswear in 2026 The Paris menswear shows weren't just about individual collections; they reflected broader trends shaping the industry. A key takeaway is the increasing importance of sustainability and ethical production. Designers are under growing pressure to minimize their environmental impact and prioritize fair labor practices. This is leading to a greater focus on durable materials, timeless designs, and responsible sourcing. Another significant trend is the blurring of lines between formal and informal wear. Men are increasingly seeking clothing that can seamlessly transition from the office to social settings. This has resulted in a demand for versatile pieces that can be dressed up or down. Finally, the rise of personalization and customization is empowering consumers to express their individuality through their clothing choices. Brands are responding by offering bespoke services and allowing customers to create unique, one-of-a-kind garments. Hermès' Summer 2026 collection, with its emphasis on refined simplicity, perfectly encapsulates these trends. DA MAN Magazine details the collection's focus on a modern city wardrobe. Similarly, 10 Magazine offers a concise overview of Hermès' SS26 menswear presentation.

Сегодня книги стали незаменимой частью массовой культуры: селебрити охотно позируют с новинками на камеру,  а бренды включают их в маркетинговые кампании. Некоторые просто начали скупать книги, чтобы казаться умнее и привлекательнее — одни ставят их как фон для видеозвонков, другие берут их с собой на прогулку как красивый аксессуар.   Книжные клубы также становятся новой популярной формой досуга. Все больше знаменитостей запускают свои читательские сообщества, где ежемесячно предлагают новую книгу и обсуждают ее с подписчиками.  Впрочем, сегодня, чтобы стать участником клуба, не нужно быть фанатом конкретной звезды — тематические сообщества легко найти как в офлайне, так и онлайн. Их создают книжные магазины, издательства, культурные пространства и просто любители литературы. Фото: Ugur Akdemir / Unsplash Механика книжных клубов довольно проста: участники заранее договариваются, какую книгу читают, а затем собираются, чтобы обсудить прочитанное. Формат встреч может быть любым — от офлайн-собраний в кафе до регулярных Zoom-сессий. Иногда книги читают вслух прямо на встречах. Обычно разговор ведет модератор — он помогает структурировать обсуждение, предлагает вопросы и следит за ходом беседы. В некоторых клубах к встречам присоединяются гости — авторы, переводчики, редакторы или книжные блогеры. Как зародились книжные клубы Идея собираться вместе, чтобы обсуждать книги, уходит корнями в античность. Еще в школе Сократа ученики рассуждали не только о литературе, но и о философии, политике и природе человека. Более привычный для нас формат появился позже — одним из первых стал клуб «Джунто», основанный Бенджамином Франклином в XVIII веке. Участники встречались по пятницам, чтобы говорить о литературе, а также организовали общественные проекты. Коммерческая модель книжного клуба появилась в 1926 году. Американец Гарри Шерман придумал подписной сервис Little Leather Library — за $2,98 читатели получали 30 небольших книг и шоколад в подарок. Позже проект перерос в клуб «Книга месяца», где редакторы выбирали важные произведения и рассылали их подписчикам.  Современный всплеск популярности начался в 1996 году, когда телеведущая Опра Уинфри запустила собственный книжный клуб. В рамках своей передачи она рекомендовала новинки, обсуждала их со зрителями и авторами. Проект стал настолько успешным, что вскоре за ним последовали другие знаменитости.  Сейчас книжные клубы есть у Сары Джессики Паркер, Дуа Липы и Риз Уизерспун. Последний — Reese's Book Club — стал настоящим феноменом: книги, попадающие в его список, неизменно становятся бестселлерами на годы. Только в 2023 году ее рекомендации разошлись тиражом более 2,3 миллиона экземпляров. Фото: Face to Face / Global Look Press К книжным клубам подключились и модные бренды. В 2024 году Miu Miu провел первую встречу своего литературного клуба в Милане, собрав представителей индустрии, журналистов и медийных персон. Chanel развивает проект Les Rendez-vous littéraires rue Cambon,  где они знакомят читателей с женской литературой. Dior также не остался в стороне — бренд посвящает литературе специальные мероприятия, приуроченные к новым коллекциям. Чем объясняется популярность книжных сообществ сегодня В мире, где цифровые технологии вытесняют живое общение, а ощущение одиночества становится все более распространенным, особенно среди молодежи, людям все чаще требуется так называемое «третье место» — пространство, отличное от дома и работы, где можно регулярно встречаться и общаться.  Книжные клубы как раз стали такой площадкой. Они дают возможность обсуждать прочитанное в кругу единомышленников, высказывать мнение, слушать других и развивать критическое мышление. Это не только способ взглянуть на текст под новым углом, но и повод выработать привычку к регулярному чтению и вдумчивому восприятию информации. Популярность литературных сообществ сегодня усиливается за счет внимания со стороны известных персон. Книги все чаще появляются в руках у селебрити, а книжные рекомендации становятся частью публичного образа.  Кроме того, важную роль сыграли социальные сети. В TikTok активно развивается сообщество BookTok, где пользователи делятся короткими отзывами, подборками, инсайтами и участвуют в литературных челленджах. Это вовлекло в чтение новую аудиторию и сделало обсуждение книг популярным форматом досуга.

Чем объясняется популярность книжных сообществ сегодня В мире, где цифровые технологии вытесняют живое общение, а ощущение одиночества становится все более распространенным, особенно среди молодежи, людям все чаще требуется так называемое «третье место» — пространство, отличное от дома и работы, где можно регулярно встречаться и общаться. Книжные клубы как раз стали такой площадкой. Они дают возможность обсуждать прочитанное в кругу единомышленников, высказывать мнение, слушать других и развивать критическое мышление. Это не только способ взглянуть на текст под новым углом, но и повод выработать привычку к регулярному чтению и вдумчивому восприятию информации. Популярность литературных сообществ сегодня усиливается за счет внимания со стороны известных персон. Книги все чаще появляются в руках у селебрити, а книжные рекомендации становятся частью публичного образа. Кроме того, важную роль сыграли социальные сети. В TikTok активно развивается сообщество BookTok, где пользователи делятся короткими отзывами, подборками, инсайтами и участвуют в литературных челленджах. Это вовлекло в чтение новую аудиторию и сделало обсуждение книг популярным форматом досуга.

As reported by NBC News, Remy's son, Jayson Scott, was arrested on charges of first-degree murder in connection with a fatal shooting that occurred in Queens, New York, on June 7, 2021. He was accused of shooting Darius Guillebeaux in Queens and additionally charged with criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment, and second-degree murder. The last known information concerning the charges against Remy's son was a seven-count indictment scheduled for June 25, 2024, alongside his alleged accomplice, Richard Swygert. Both Jayson and Richard were held without bail. ABC7's June 2024 report further noted that if convicted of the top count, Jayson could face life in prison without the possibility of parole. In the now-viral video, Remy Ma is seen recording the victim's daughter while the two engage in a verbal altercation. Jazmin Dior later shared a clip saying that Remy acted like her son was the victim without any remorse, while she can't see her father anymore. In her video calling out Remy Ma's behavior, Jazmin Dior—the daughter of Jayson Scott's alleged murder victim—criticized the rapper for acting tough outside a courthouse, warning that such behavior could land her in jail. Jazmin added that Remy had already been to jail before, questioning if the rapper was trying to go back in with such an attitude. For the unversed, Remy was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2008 after being convicted of criminal possession of a weapon and assault. As reported by Reuters in May 2008, the rapper shot and wounded an acquaintance after discovering that money was missing from her purse following a night out in Manhattan. During sentencing, Criminal Court Judge Rena Uviller described Remy Ma as ""an extremely angry young woman whose anger is completely out of control."" According to the case details, Remy Ma doubted her friend Makeda of taking $3,000 from her. This led to an altercation during which the gun went off while the pair struggled over a purse. The bullet passed through Makeda's colon and hit her rectum, requiring three weeks of hospitalization. Remy's lawyer, Ivan Fisher, defended the rapper by stating that the shooting, which took place on July 14, 2007, was accidental. He claimed the victim, Makeda Barnes-Joseph, put forth an exaggerated claim to acquire a large sum in a separate civil suit. During her appearance on We Playin' Spades in September 2024, Nick Cannon asked Remy what one thing she would take back in her life if she got the opportunity. Answering the same without hesitation, Remy Ma said: Apart from the latest controversy, Remy Ma has also made headlines for discussing her separation from Papoose. The former couple married in 2008 while Remy was incarcerated. Papoose filed for divorce in May 2025, citing irreconcilable differences.","On July 1, 2025, posted a video showing rapper Remy Ma in a verbal altercation with Jazmin Dior, the daughter of her son Jayson Scott's alleged murder victim, outside a courthouse.

418372e327970a1faad18720f3f7ac6d,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]PN - Ter dinheiro não significa ter bom gosto! Decididamente foi um circo de horrores. É a história de uma cidade e dois casamentos com uma década de intervalo e um abismo ainda maior em termos de estilo e dignidade. Enquanto Veneza se recupera da tomada de poder cafona das núpcias de US$ 20 milhões de Bezos e Sanchez, com seus protestos anticapitalistas, tempestades estranhas e o onipresente decote Kardashian, lembro-me de quando a Cidade Flutuante sediou o grande dia de uma celebridade de classe mundial. Em 2014, George e Amal Clooney estabeleceram o modelo Dolce Vita para a alta sociedade italiana no elegante Aman Grand Canal Hotel, de sete estrelas, com uma aula magistral sobre protagonistas românticos clássicos, dignos da antiga Cidade do Amor. Com um orçamento relativamente modesto de US$ 4,6 milhões, o casal, que se conheceu na Itália um ano antes, casou-se diante de apenas 60 convidados. A plateia, que incluía alguns VIPs, incluindo Anna Wintour e Cindy Crawford , estava impecavelmente vestida, em vez de pela metade – ao contrário de Kim, Khloé, Kylie e Kendall, que estavam entre as muitas ""estrelas"" que se exibiram nas celebrações dos Bezos. George exibia um terno Armani de cashmere feito sob medida, enquanto a advogada libanesa britânica de direitos humanos, Amal, personificava a elegância em um recatado vestido de noiva Oscar de la Renta, de renda. Resumindo, os fotogênicos Clooneys estavam prontos para o close sem parecerem especialmente desesperados por isso, o que não pode ser dito dos posers com sorriso irônico, Jeff e Lauren. Porque a atmosfera geral desse casamento, ao longo de três dias de celebração, estava mais para reality show do que para a velha Hollywood. Mesmo usando um smoking clássico e exibindo um visual renovado, Jeff parecia mais um vendedor prestes a participar de uma conferência do que um titã da tecnologia. Sejamos realistas, o tom foi dado quando os ""pombinhos"" (com idade combinada de 111 anos) deram início aos eventos com uma festa de espuma no convés de seu iate de US$ 500 milhões. A dupla parece ter o dom de fazer gastos exorbitantes parecerem espetacularmente baratos. Por que se contentar em apenas alugar um hotel quando você pode alugar uma ilha inteira? (San Giorgio Maggiore, neste caso, para a cerimônia em si). Por que perder a chance de trocar seu anel de noivado de diamante rosa de 30 quilates e US$ 3 milhões por um anel de diamante de 35 quilates do tamanho de um ovo?

News World.","SPR_COMBO[pt]PN - Ter dinheiro não significa ter bom gosto! Decididamente foi um circo de horrores. É a história de uma cidade e dois casamentos com uma década de intervalo e um abismo ainda maior em termos de estilo e dignidade. Enquanto Veneza se recupera da tomada de poder cafona das núpcias de US$ 20 milhões de Bezos e Sanchez, com seus protestos anticapitalistas, tempestades estranhas e o onipresente decote Kardashian, lembro-me de quando a Cidade Flutuante sediou o grande dia de uma celebridade de classe mundial. Em 2014, George e Amal Clooney estabeleceram o modelo Dolce Vita para a alta sociedade italiana no elegante Aman Grand Canal Hotel, de sete estrelas, com uma aula magistral sobre protagonistas românticos clássicos, dignos da antiga Cidade do Amor. Com um orçamento relativamente modesto de US$ 4,6 milhões, o casal, que se conheceu na Itália um ano antes, casou-se diante de apenas 60 convidados. A plateia, que incluía alguns VIPs, incluindo Anna Wintour e Cindy Crawford , estava impecavelmente vestida, em vez de pela metade – ao contrário de Kim, Khloé, Kylie e Kendall, que estavam entre as muitas ""estrelas"" que se exibiram nas celebrações dos Bezos. George exibia um terno Armani de cashmere feito sob medida, enquanto a advogada libanesa britânica de direitos humanos, Amal, personificava a elegância em um recatado vestido de noiva Oscar de la Renta, de renda. Resumindo, os fotogênicos Clooneys estavam prontos para o close sem parecerem especialmente desesperados por isso, o que não pode ser dito dos posers com sorriso irônico, Jeff e Lauren. Porque a atmosfera geral desse casamento, ao longo de três dias de celebração, estava mais para reality show do que para a velha Hollywood. Mesmo usando um smoking clássico e exibindo um visual renovado, Jeff parecia mais um vendedor prestes a participar de uma conferência do que um titã da tecnologia. Sejamos realistas, o tom foi dado quando os ""pombinhos"" (com idade combinada de 111 anos) deram início aos eventos com uma festa de espuma no convés de seu iate de US$ 500 milhões. A dupla parece ter o dom de fazer gastos exorbitantes parecerem espetacularmente baratos. Por que se contentar em apenas alugar um hotel quando você pode alugar uma ilha inteira? (San Giorgio Maggiore, neste caso, para a cerimônia em si). Por que perder a chance de trocar seu anel de noivado de diamante rosa de 30 quilates e US$ 3 milhões por um anel de diamante de 35 quilates do tamanho de um ovo? Ambos lembram peças de fantasia desajeitadas, quando comparados ao clássico deslumbrante de Amal, de US$ 500.000 e sete quilates, extraído eticamente. E enquanto Amal impressionou com três looks icônicos - um terninho Stella McCartney de seda creme com detalhes azul-marinho para a cerimônia civil no Palácio Ca' Farsetti, um vestido Oscar de la Renta marfim para o casamento e um prateado para a recepção - Sanchez optou por uma série exaustiva de trocas de figurino.

My skin is sensitive, acne-prone, and combination, so I really need something that: * Doesn't clog pores or break me out * Feels lightweight and comfortable * Lasts all day (I'm usually out from 6:30 AM to 7:30 PM, with gym after work — I can wash my face before the gym to remove makeup, but sometimes it's a hassle. That said, I'd rather have healthy skin, and the weather in my region is extremely hot in the summer and very cold in the winter) * I will be using that one product all over my face thinly for when I have events and such, but I only do that when there is something going on which is maximum 12 times a year and maybe even less. * Is actually worth the money (no fading, caking, or separating) **Budget for makeup:** I'd rather avoid expensive products that break the bank, but I'm willing to spend if it's something I'll truly use and not regret buying.

UgxHBWDe6zUAR4PAeQ14AaABAg,"  Aloha gorgeous, Wow, that Guerlain palette was made for you! So gorgeous, and I think you could wear it year round. For the Guerlain powder, I like the translucent all over, but more so for under the eyes, and any where I need brightening. It has a slight pink tint to it. The Medium powder I like all over, not under my eyes. It's a bit too dark under the eyes for me. I also love the medium shade if my foundation looks a bit too light, and it's gorgeous over a tinted SPF too. The powder is amazing, I agree with the container being a bit too big. I wish they would have included a smaller container to decant for travel. That would be great, especially for the price. I have to try a Guerlain blush, I'm having a hard time picking out a shade.I don't have a store nearby where I can swatch. Our Nordstrom is far, and they seem to not have much selection of Guerlain even on line. I'm not sure what's going on. My new obsession is the Prada eye shadows. I have 3 palettes, and I love them so much. Along with the Dior Cannage LE palettes. Have you tried the Dior Cannage yet? I think you would love Brown Cashmere. It's so gorgeous!! The formula is comparable to the Prada. I want to try the Guerlain shadows, but I haven't found a color story that resonates yet. Lately I've been into the smaller palettes versus large palettes. Just easier to put a look together when you're short on time. Thank you for your video, hope you're all enjoying the Summer! Xoxo PS. I love the Guerlain concealer it's lovely for the summer. I wish it came in a plastic container versus the glass, and the wand was easier to get out. I dropped mine on my tile floor, and it shattered. I order another one. What do you think about the Gucci concealer? I would like to try it, but can't figure out what shade.","Aloha gorgeous, Wow, that Guerlain palette was made for you!

The summer midi dress – be it figure-skimming and polka dotted or oversized and airy – is finally being given the attention it deserves. Consider a summer dress with an interesting neckline, namely something strapless or asymmetric. Specifically, we can't stop thinking about Versace's slinky, floral bandeau dress, which was styled with metallic chartreuse sling-backs and a mini bag (hello again, Y2K) on the runway.

mov_F18EE99AD25E9C1253C176FEE7ECFBBE,"  PAU BARRENA // AFP via If you are working in influencer marketing, you must have heard of the new buzzword: AI influencers. AI influencers, also known as virtual influencers, are quickly becoming one of the most talked-about trends in the influencer marketing world. These digital personalities, often powered by AI and CGI, can look and behave like real people. Some are animated or stylized, while others are nearly indistinguishable from humans. While AI influencers won't replace human creators, they are changing the game, offering new opportunities for creative campaigns, brand storytelling, and customer interaction. Understanding how to work with these digital personas is key for marketers who want to stay ahead of the curve. In this article, CreatorDB explores the evolution of AI influencers, why they're gaining popularity, how leading brands are using them, and what this trend means for the future of influencer marketing. What Are AI Influencers? AI influencers are digital personas created using AI tools and CGI. They behave like human influencers, posting content, engaging with followers, and partnering with brands, but they are not real people. Some are managed by agencies, while others are entirely autonomous with AI-generated visuals and personalities. According to The Conversation, there are three main types of AI influencers: Non-Humans – Characters that are clearly fictional (e.g., mascots). Animated Humans – Stylized or cartoon-like personas. Hyper-Realistic CGI Humans – Nearly indistinguishable from real people. Some of the most well-known examples include: LilMiquela – Fashion and music influencer with over 2.7 million followers. Imma – A Japanese virtual model with a highly engaged following. Kuki – An interactive chatbot with a social media presence. A Brief History of Virtual Influencers The concept of AI influencers first came out in the early 2010s. Back then, the early versions of AI influencers were simply virtual characters in the gaming and entertainment industry. As AI and computer graphics developed, these characters started to have more nuances and became more sophisticated, eventually becoming the virtual influencers we see today. In 2016, the world welcomed Lil Miquela, who is considered the first official hyperrealistic AI influencer in history. After her release, there were a ton of debates about whether she was a real person or not. Since then, the virtual influencer industry has exploded: CB from Casa Bahia – A Brazilian virtual mascot with over 10M followers. Milla Sofia – An AI-generated influencer using diffusion models. Brand-created influencers – From Lu of Magalu to Noonoouri, companies are building and managing their own digital ambassadors. Why Are Brands Turning to AI Influencers? Though still niche, AI influencers appeal to brands for several compelling reasons: Total control over content, messaging, and brand representation No scandals or PR risks, unlike human influencers Always available for campaigns and engagement Cost-effective over time High novelty value, boosting brand buzz and attention Besides those reasons, according to Influencer Marketing Hub data, AI influencers are collecting excellent feedback from the marketers who worked with them and inspiring more collaborations: 59.8% of marketing professionals have worked with AI influencers 15.5% plan to collaborate with AI influencers Over 60% of those who once collaborated with virtual influencers are satisfied. Since AI influencers don't exist as people outside of their social media feeds, a team of professionals manages them, making it easier to align them with the specifics of a marketing campaign. CreatorDB Case Studies: How Brands Are Using AI Influencers Although there is still no data about how effective AI influencers are compared to traditional influencers, it is clear that the fit with the product is still the most critical factor for a successful influencer marketing campaign. Audiences might be happy to see the innovation of AI influencers, but they may find human influencers more relatable regarding certain products. Still, AI influencers are great if brands want to showcase an innovative image and position themselves at the forefront of a trend.

The U.S.-China trade war poses challenges, impacting costs and availability. Key trends include circular economy initiatives, online retail strategies, and urban demand in emerging markets. Segment growth varies, with watches and jewelry leading, while beauty and fragrances witness fastest growth. APAC remains the dominant region, driven by urbanization and digital retail transformation. Major players like LVMH and Rolex leverage strategic partnerships and innovation to maintain market positioning. Personal Luxury Goods Market Dublin, July 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Personal Luxury Goods Market Research Report 2025-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Personal Luxury Goods Market was valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.24%. The global personal luxury goods market is fragmented and characterized by numerous manufacturers that hold modest market share. Key players, including LVH, Prada Group, Rolex, Kering, and Richemont, among others, have established dominance in the market by continuously innovating and expanding their product offerings. Major vendors are strategically implementing innovative technologies to maintain their market positions. For instance, in 2023, Burberry introduced its virtual store by partnering with Blankos Block Party, a gaming platform, and offering interactive product discovery. The companies in the personal luxury goods industry are also focusing on several strategic partnerships with other providers to ensure continuous supply chains and manufacturing capabilities. For instance, in 2023, Kering completed a 30% acquisition of the Italian luxury fashion house Valentino. The partnership is between Valentino's parent company, Mayhoola, and it has also provided an option for Kering to acquire the remaining 70% by 2028. The leaders in the personal luxury goods market are making significant R&D investments to enhance the availability and differentiation of their products. For instance, in 2024, Richemont acquired Vhernier, which is an Italian jewelry brand, to enhance its Jewelry Maisons division. Furthermore, companies are increasingly expanding their product range and strengthening their market positions through acquisitions and partnerships. For instance, in 2024, Lavie Luxe launched its new 18% fragrance concentration perfume line, featuring four Eau de Parfum fragrances named LUSH, LILY, LAGOON, and LOVE. Consumers are increasingly interested in luxury goods that are designed with circular economic principles, such as those that can be easily upcycled. Gucci was the first luxury brand to use ECONYL recycled nylon in ready-wear pieces, which is a 100% recycled nylon derived from fishing nets, textile waste, and a thick pile fabric used for carpets and upholstery. Luxury brands have increasingly adopted online approaches to meet evolving consumer expectations. For instance, in 2023, Dior was the most popular luxury brand online because of its strategic investments in digital marketing, e-commerce, and social media engagement. This approach helped the brand to engage a wider audience, which has boosted its online sales, especially in markets like China and the US. Brands strategically position themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops in places like Bali and Phuket. It has created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. Hence, such factors are supporting the demand for the personal luxury goods market across emerging nations. As the global economies continue to grow, disposable income levels rise, leading to increased spending on luxury items like footwear. Consumers are increasingly inclined towards luxury footwear because of changing lifestyles and fashion trends. Luxury footwear companies are focusing on the growing consumer base in developing countries such as India and other Southeast Asian countries, where wealth and demand for luxury goods are rising. In 2022, Louis Vuitton introduced its exclusive footwear collection for the Indian market, which features new colors like Rani Pink and glittering designs for celebrating India's cultural heritage. Urbanization in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia continues to drive demand for the personal luxury goods market. In India, platforms like Luxepolis have significantly supported the development of the market by offering new and pre-owned luxury items to a growing audience in smaller cities, as the growing urban population increases the demand for high-end items. Brands are strategically positioning themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops to places like Bali and Phuket. Additionally, collaborations between fashion houses and hospitality venues such as Fendi's beach club in Marbella have created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS The disruption in the supply chain has led to increased costs for raw materials, logistics, and transportation, which have raised operational costs and are often passed on to end consumers which leading to higher luxury goods prices. The focus on limited production to maintain exclusivity significantly raises the production costs for luxury brands. Brands often face higher unit costs for manufacturing, sourcing premium materials, and utilizing skilled labor for producing limited edition items. This limits scalability and hampers the personal luxury goods market demand. Furthermore, major brands occasionally face backlash for products or marketing campaigns, such as Louis Vuitton for selling a scarf inspired by the Palestinian keffiyeh and a jacket that seems to present Jamaican culture by using the country's flags but incorrectly represented. These factors hamper the brand value and show the need for careful consideration in global marketing efforts. PERSONAL LUXURY GOODS MARKET GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS The APAC region dominated the global personal luxury goods market, accounting for a share of over 38% in 2024. APAC is experiencing a surge in urbanization and rising disposable income, particularly in countries like China, India, and Southeast Asian countries.

The U.S.-China trade war poses challenges, impacting costs and availability. Key trends include circular economy initiatives, online retail strategies, and urban demand in emerging markets.

APAC remains the dominant region, driven by urbanization and digital retail transformation. Major players like LVMH and Rolex leverage strategic partnerships and innovation to maintain market positioning.

For instance, in 2023, Burberry introduced its virtual store by partnering with Blankos Block Party, a gaming platform, and offering interactive product discovery. The companies in the personal luxury goods industry are also focusing on several strategic partnerships with other providers to ensure continuous supply chains and manufacturing capabilities. For instance, in 2023, Kering completed a 30% acquisition of the Italian luxury fashion house Valentino. The partnership is between Valentino's parent company, Mayhoola, and it has also provided an option for Kering to acquire the remaining 70% by 2028.

mov_0F616B39CDCF16B93AE3EDD8AD4F4C1C,"  An everyday lipstick, like any other part of a makeup or beauty routine, is inherently personal and varies from person to person. I've gone through practically every phase imaginable. At one point, a bright cherry red was my go-to. At another, I wanted a nude lipstick so subtle I could barely tell it apart from my natural lip color—the versatility is part of what makes playing with makeup so fun. Still, there are a few boxes that your go-to formula should easily check. “A great everyday lipstick is all about balance,” says celebrity makeup artist Ash K. Holm. “It should be comfortable, long-wearing, and easy to apply without a mirror.” Holm adds that a formula that hydrates the lips is ideal, but it also needs enough pigment to pull a look together. On top of that, it should fade evenly—no harsh lines as it wears off throughout the day. Sounds like a tall order? It is, but that's where I come in. Next to blush, lipstick is one of my absolute favorite makeup categories to test, and I've come across quite a few that can satisfy even the pickiest beauty lover. Keep reading to find the everyday lipstick that deserves a spot in your collection. The Best Everyday Lipsticks Best Everyday Lipstick Overall MAC Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick in Thanks, It's Mac! MAC's Lustreglass Lipstick, specifically in the shade Thanks It's MAC, is the closest thing to a truly universal lipstick that I have ever found. It's a taupey pink with a silver pearl, but don't let that scare you—the shimmer is virtually nonexistent in this formula once you swipe it onto your lips. One of my favorite things about this shade is that it can be worn with or without a lip liner, and it layers beautifully. Finish: Glossy Key Ingredients: Castor seed oil, shea butter, squalane (moisturizing) What I Love: Looks good on the majority of skin tones; Sleek packaging; Barely-there scent What I Don't: Due to the emollience of the formula, it wears off quickly Review for MC: “This is one of my favorite lipsticks of all time, and for good reason. It's a neutral-toned taupe pink color that doesn't veer too cool or warm, making it perfectly suitable for a variety of skin tones. It also layers beautifully with other lipstick formulas in my collection, acting almost like a traditional gloss by depositing color without taking over the entire look.” — Ariel Baker, Beauty Writer Ariel Baker testing MAC Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick in Thanks, Its Mac! (Image credit: Ariel Baker) Best Everyday Neutral Lipstick NYX Smushy Matte Lip Balm in Soft Smile This is a newer formula to my makeup routine, but I'm so glad I came across it. The Smush Matte Lip Balms sound a little confusing (mainly because I've never used a lip balm that's actually matte before), but once I applied it, I saw the magic in the formula. I'd consider this more of a blurring lipstick, similar to soft-focus formulas popular in the K-Beauty space. The shade Soft Smile, a brown nude, is the closest I've gotten to a true skin-toned match on myself in a long time, but it also works nicely as a neutral across a majority of skin tones. And as the brand claims, it really does blur the lines in my lips, creating a gorgeous, soft-matte canvas. Finish: Matte Key Ingredients: Dimethicone (silicone base that smooths lines); Ceramide np (improves skin barrier function); Shea butter (moisturizes) What I Love: 12 shades; Most affordable lipstick on this list What I Don't: Strong caramel scent that lingers for a bit before fading, which is a personal preference Review for MC: “This is such a fun lipstick to keep in my purse. Not only is it super compact, but the formula feels almost like a traditional silicone primer on my lips, and just like those formulas, it blurs the lines and imperfections on the area while depositing color—a win-win if you ask me. While it has a strong scent, I'm completely willing to overlook it not only for the unique formula but also the gorgeous nude shade that is Soft Smile, which complements my skin tone perfectly.” — Ariel Baker, Beauty Writer Ariel Baker testing NYX Smushy Matte Lip Balm in Soft Smile.

Half of the systems including Click and Collect are still down despite online orders being restarted in June, the retailer's boss said. Stuart Machin told the retailer's annual general meeting that after the brand goes 'fully on' the focus will then be on getting its Castle Donington distribution centre in the East Midlands 'back and running'. He said that 'we will have the vast majority of this behind us' by August. Hackers disrupted contactless payments and Click and Collect during the cyber attack in April. The retailer then confirmed that customer data had been stolen, although it said no passwords or card details were accessed. The attack will wipe around £300 million from this year's profits, the chain has estimated, with the losses only being partly covered by insurance. Online orders have resumed in England, Scotland and Wales, but customers in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are still waiting for the service. Mr Machin said: 'Currently, half of online is open but not areas like Click and Collect. Within the next four weeks we are hoping for the whole of online to be fully on. 'Then our focus will be getting the Donington site back and running.' The high street giant has previously said that the disruption to services will continue into June and July. Last week, it sent out e-gift cards to customers who had online orders cancelled or had click and collect orders delayed. A message on the M&S website today reads: 'We will resume Click & Collect, Next Day Delivery and UK Nominated Day Delivery for fashion and international ordering in the coming weeks.' The retailer is just one of many household names that have been hacked recently including Co-op, Harrods and Dior. In April,  Co-op had to shut down its IT systems to stop hackers from snatching personal and financial information like shopper passwords or bank details. As with the  M&S cyber attack, Co-op shoppers were left contending with empty shelves and deliveries being paused. Do you have a story you would like to share?

mov_FDD16DCD57A31E091D8DD457A8FE5E34,"  If you are working in influencer marketing, you must have heard of the new buzzword: AI influencers. AI influencers, also known as virtual influencers, are quickly becoming one of the most talked-about trends in the influencer marketing world. These digital personalities, often powered by AI and CGI, can look and behave like real people. Some are animated or stylized, while others are nearly indistinguishable from humans. While AI influencers won't replace human creators, they are changing the game, offering new opportunities for creative campaigns, brand storytelling, and customer interaction. Understanding how to work with these digital personas is key for marketers who want to stay ahead of the curve. In this article, CreatorDB explores the evolution of AI influencers, why they're gaining popularity, how leading brands are using them, and what this trend means for the future of influencer marketing. What Are AI Influencers? AI influencers are digital personas created using AI tools and CGI. They behave like human influencers, posting content, engaging with followers, and partnering with brands, but they are not real people. Some are managed by agencies, while others are entirely autonomous with AI-generated visuals and personalities. According to The Conversation, there are three main types of AI influencers: Non-Humans – Characters that are clearly fictional (e.g., mascots). Animated Humans – Stylized or cartoon-like personas. Hyper-Realistic CGI Humans – Nearly indistinguishable from real people. Some of the most well-known examples include: LilMiquela – Fashion and music influencer with over 2.7 million followers. Imma – A Japanese virtual model with a highly engaged following. Kuki – An interactive chatbot with a social media presence. A Brief History of Virtual Influencers The concept of AI influencers first came out in the early 2010s. Back then, the early versions of AI influencers were simply virtual characters in the gaming and entertainment industry. As AI and computer graphics developed, these characters started to have more nuances and became more sophisticated, eventually becoming the virtual influencers we see today. In 2016, the world welcomed Lil Miquela, who is considered the first official hyperrealistic AI influencer in history. After her release, there were a ton of debates about whether she was a real person or not. Since then, the virtual influencer industry has exploded: CB from Casa Bahia – A Brazilian virtual mascot with over 10M followers. Milla Sofia – An AI-generated influencer using diffusion models. Brand-created influencers – From Lu of Magalu to Noonoouri, companies are building and managing their own digital ambassadors. Why Are Brands Turning to AI Influencers? Though still niche, AI influencers appeal to brands for several compelling reasons: Total control over content, messaging, and brand representation No scandals or PR risks, unlike human influencers Always available for campaigns and engagement Cost-effective over time High novelty value, boosting brand buzz and attention Besides those reasons, according to Influencer Marketing Hub data, AI influencers are collecting excellent feedback from the marketers who worked with them and inspiring more collaborations: 59.8% of marketing professionals have worked with AI influencers 15.5% plan to collaborate with AI influencers Over 60% of those who once collaborated with virtual influencers are satisfied. Since AI influencers don't exist as people outside of their social media feeds, a team of professionals manages them, making it easier to align them with the specifics of a marketing campaign. Case Studies: How Brands Are Using AI Influencers Although there is still no data about how effective AI influencers are compared to traditional influencers, it is clear that the fit with the product is still the most critical factor for a successful influencer marketing campaign. Audiences might be happy to see the innovation of AI influencers, but they may find human influencers more relatable regarding certain products. Still, AI influencers are great if brands want to showcase an innovative image and position themselves at the forefront of a trend. CreatorDB found three case studies in different industries to help you better understand how to work with AI influencers. 1.

Earlier this year for Dior's Spring/Summer 2025 haute couture collection, Chanakya and graduates from its nonprofit, Chanakya School of Craft, created a backdrop of large-scale textile panels titled “The Flowers We Grew,” imagined by artist Rithika Merchant. The show's interior atmosphere was enlivened by nine large-scale panels that hung from the walls, each representing Indian heritage and values special to Merchant. Mimicking the brushstrokes and chemical composition of the watercolor paintings, the hand-embroidered collaboration took 306 artisans 144,000 hours to execute.

Earlier this year for Dior's Spring/Summer 2025 haute couture collection, Chanakya and graduates from its nonprofit, Chanakya School of Craft, created a backdrop of large-scale textile panels titled “The Flowers We Grew,” imagined by artist Rithika Merchant. The show's interior atmosphere was enlivened by nine large-scale panels that hung from the walls, each representing Indian heritage and values special to Merchant. Mimicking the brushstrokes and chemical composition of the watercolor paintings, the hand-embroidered collaboration took 306 artisans 144,000 hours to execute.

a63034f9084bfe42fe33157e2bd79a69,"  SPR_COMBO[lv]Ievads: Mūžīgās elegances triumfs Losandželosā Losandželosas koši sarkanā paklāja spožums reti kad atklāj patiesu modes revolūciju, tomēr aktrisei Umai Tūrmanei (Uma Thurman) tas izdevās ar pārsteidzošu vienkāršību un dziļu nozīmi. Filmas “The Old Guard 2” pirmizrādē, kas notika nesen, 2025. gada 25. jūnijā, Tūrmane neizvēlējās jaunu, tikko no podiuma nākušu tērpu, bet gan uzvilka teju trīs desmitgades vecu Prada kleitu no zīmola 1997. gada pavasara kolekcijas. Šī izvēle nebija tikai modes paziņojums; tā bija klusa, tomēr spēcīga manifestācija par mūžīgu stilu, ilgtspējību un personīgo identitāti, kas nepakļaujas ātrās modes mainīgajām vīzijām. Vēstījums sarkanajam paklājam: 28 gadus veca kleita ar jaunu elpu Kamēr citi vadošie aktieri, piemēram, Šarlīze Terona (Charlize Theron) un Kiki Leina (Kiki Layne), “The Old Guard 2” pirmizrādē demonstrēja mūsdienīgus dizaineru tērpus, Uma Tūrmane izcēlās ar savu pārdomāto un nostalģisko izvēli. Viņas tērps, kas sastāvēja no mandarīnu apkaklītes augšdaļas un zīda A veida svārkiem ar izsmalcinātu chinoiserie lapu žakarda motīvu, ne tikai piesaistīja uzmanību, bet arī iedarbināja plašāku diskusiju par modes vērtībām un patiesu eleganci. Lai gan daži interneta komentētāji sākumā apšaubīja tērpa piegulšanu vai krāsu, lielākā daļa vienojās, ka tas izstaro klasisku Umas Tūrmanes šarmu – līdzsvaru starp izsmalcinātību un relaksāciju, kas raksturīgs viņas stilam. Šī Prada kleita, precīzāk, tās iedvesma no 1997. gada pavasara kolekcijas, ir vairāk nekā tikai auduma gabals; tā ir gabals no modes vēstures, kas atdzīvināts jaunā kontekstā. Tā runā par apģērbu kā investīciju, nevis īslaicīgu kaprīzi, un apstiprina, ka patiesais stils ir nepakļāvīgs laika zobs. Aktrises izvēle vēl jo vairāk izceļas pašreizējā strauji mainīgajā modes ainā, kur katra jauna sezona atnes tūkstošiem jaunu tendenču un tērpu, radot milzīgu vides slogu. Tūrmanes rīcība ir kā svaiga gaisa malks, kas aicina apstāties un novērtēt to, kas jau pastāv un ir izturējis laika pārbaudi. Prada 1997. gada pavasara kolekcija: Miučijas Pradas sapnis un vīzija Lai pilnībā novērtētu Umas Tūrmanes izvēles nozīmi, ir jāiedziļinās Miučijas Pradas (Miuccia Prada) daiļrades kontekstā 1997. gadā. Toreizējā Prada pavasara/vasaras kolekcija bija iezīmēta ar izteiktu romantismu un sapņainību, atšķiroties no zīmola agrākajām, bieži vien stingrākajām neilona siluetēm. Šī kolekcija piedāvāja plandošas, caurspīdīgas kleitas ar delikātiem augu motīviem, kas apvienoja smalkumu un minimālismu ar smalku estētiku. Miučija Prada meklēja jaunu sievišķības izpausmi, attālinoties no tolaik valdošās ""modei neglītais"" tendences un pievēršoties kaut kam ēteriskākam un trauslākam. Kolekcijas raksturīgās iezīmes bija tieši šie chinoiserie motīvi – smalki zīda audumi, uz kuriem vijās izšuvumi vai apdrukas ar Āzijas iedvesmotiem lapu vai ziedu rakstiem. Šī estētika toreiz bija drosmīgs solis, jo Pradas reputācija balstījās uz intelektuālu, bieži vien askētisku pieeju, kas neizcēlās ar acīmredzamu glamūru. Taču tieši šajā kontrastā slēpās tās ģenialitāte: Miučija Prada spēja apvienot tradicionālo ar moderno, radot tērpus, kas bija vienlaikus gan eleganti, gan nedaudz neparasti. Umas Tūrmanes izvēlētā kleita, kas atspoguļo šīs kolekcijas dvēseli, bija un joprojām ir apliecinājums Pradas spējai radīt apģērbu, kas pārsniedz sezonālas tendences un kļūst par daļu no modes kanona. Umas Tūrmanes stils: Nepakļaušanās un pāri laika robežām Uma Tūrmane jau gadu desmitiem ir pazīstama ar savu izsmalcināto un bieži vien neparasto stila izjūtu. Viņa nekad nav bijusi akli sekojoša tendencēm, drīzāk radot savu, atpazīstamu elegances zīmolu. Viņas ilgstošās attiecības ar Prada modes namu sākās jau 90. gados, kad 1995. gada Oskara balvu ceremonijā viņa parādījās purpura Prada kleitā, nostiprinot savu statusu kā stila ikona. Tajā laikā Prada vēl nebija tik plaši atpazīstama kā šodien, un Tūrmanes izvēle bija drosmīga un negaidīta, iezīmējot zīmola ceļu uz starptautisku slavu un apliecinot aktrises izpratni par jaunām vīzijām modē. Gadu gaitā Tūrmane ir pierādījusi savu stilistisko daudzveidību, bez piepūles pārejot no romantiskām balles kleitām uz šikiem, piegrieztiem kostīmiem. Viņa izvēlas Eiropas dizainerus, piemēram, Versace un Dior, taču vienmēr saglabā savu unikālo identitāti. Viņas jaunākā izvēle – Prada kleita no 1997. gada – nav nejauša. Tā ir dziļi apzināta vēlme apliecināt vērtību laikam, meistarībai un stila ilgmūžībai. Tūrmane, kas pati ir kino ikona, ar savu tērpu it kā saka, ka patiesā vērtība slēpjas nevis jaunos apģērbos, bet gan spējā atdzīvināt un novērtēt to, kas jau ir sevi pierādījis kā izcilu. Vintage modes pieaugums: Aicinājums uz apzinātu patēriņu Umas Tūrmanes izvēle atspoguļo plašāku un arvien pieaugošu tendenci modes pasaulē: vintage apģērbu popularitāti uz sarkanā paklāja. Šī tendence, ko veicina tādi stilisti kā Lau Ročs (Law Roach) un tādas zvaigznes kā Zendaja (Zendaya) un Kendala Dženere (Kendall Jenner), ir kļuvusi par veidu, kā izcelties un paust nostāju. Tas nav tikai jauns modes kliedziens; tas ir daudzslāņains fenomens, ko virza vairāki būtiski faktori. Pirmkārt, tā ir alkas pēc individualitātes un unikalitātes. Ātrās modes laikmetā, kurā tūkstošiem cilvēku valkā līdzīgus apģērbus no masveida ražošanas, vintage piedāvā iespēju atrast patiesi oriģinālus, bieži vien ar rokām darinātus vai ierobežotās tirāžās radītus gabalus. Tie stāsta savu stāstu, nes sevī pagātnes atbalsis un ļauj to valkātājam justies īpašam. Otrkārt, tas ir spēcīgs solis ilgtspējības virzienā. Modes industrija ir viena no lielākajām piesārņotājām pasaulē, kas patērē milzīgus ūdens un enerģijas resursus, kā arī rada milzīgu atkritumu daudzumu. Izvēloties vintage, slavenības sūta skaidru vēstījumu par apzinātu patēriņu un resursu saglabāšanu. Tā ir atbilde uz augošo vides apziņu un vēlmi samazināt modes ekoloģisko pēdu. Atkārtoti izmantojot un novērtējot jau radīto, mēs veicinām aprites ekonomiku un samazinām pieprasījumu pēc jauniem, bieži vien neētiskos apstākļos ražotiem apģērbiem. Treškārt, vintage ir saistīts ar nostalģiju un vēstures novērtējumu. Šīs drēbes nav vienkārši “vecas”; tās ir archīva pērles, kas atspoguļo konkrētus periodus modes dizainā, kultūrā un sabiedrībā. Valkājot tās, slavenības ne tikai godina pagātnes dizainerus un meistarību, bet arī veido tiltu starp dažādiem modes laikmetiem, pierādot, ka patiesais skaistums ir pārejošs. Modes ietekme un zvaigžņu atbildība Zvaigžņu izvēlēm uz sarkanā paklāja ir milzīga ietekme uz globālajām modes tendencēm un patērētāju uzvedību. Kad tāda ikona kā Uma Tūrmane izvēlas vintage, tas nav tikai individuāls lēmums; tas ir publisks paziņojums, kas iedvesmo miljoniem cilvēku. Tas liek aizdomāties par ātrās modes ēnas pusēm – par tās ietekmi uz vidi, par strādnieku tiesībām, par pārmērīgu patēriņu....","SPR_COMBO[lv]Ievads: Mūžīgās elegances triumfs Losandželosā Losandželosas koši sarkanā paklāja spožums reti kad atklāj patiesu modes revolūciju, tomēr aktrisei Umai Tūrmanei (Uma Thurman) tas izdevās ar pārsteidzošu vienkāršību un dziļu nozīmi.

Umas Tūrmanes izvēlētā kleita, kas atspoguļo šīs kolekcijas dvēseli, bija un joprojām ir apliecinājums Pradas spējai radīt apģērbu, kas pārsniedz sezonālas tendences un kļūst par daļu no modes kanona. Umas Tūrmanes stils: Nepakļaušanās un pāri laika robežām Uma Tūrmane jau gadu desmitiem ir pazīstama ar savu izsmalcināto un bieži vien neparasto stila izjūtu. Viņa nekad nav bijusi akli sekojoša tendencēm, drīzāk radot savu, atpazīstamu elegances zīmolu. Viņas ilgstošās attiecības ar Prada modes namu sākās jau 90. gados, kad 1995. gada Oskara balvu ceremonijā viņa parādījās purpura Prada kleitā, nostiprinot savu statusu kā stila ikona. Tajā laikā Prada vēl nebija tik plaši atpazīstama kā šodien, un Tūrmanes izvēle bija drosmīga un negaidīta, iezīmējot zīmola ceļu uz starptautisku slavu un apliecinot aktrises izpratni par jaunām vīzijām modē. Gadu gaitā Tūrmane ir pierādījusi savu stilistisko daudzveidību, bez piepūles pārejot no romantiskām balles kleitām uz šikiem, piegrieztiem kostīmiem. Viņa izvēlas Eiropas dizainerus, piemēram, Versace un Dior, taču vienmēr saglabā savu unikālo identitāti. Viņas jaunākā izvēle – Prada kleita no 1997. gada – nav nejauša. Tā ir dziļi apzināta vēlme apliecināt vērtību laikam, meistarībai un stila ilgmūžībai. Tūrmane, kas pati ir kino ikona, ar savu tērpu it kā saka, ka patiesā vērtība slēpjas nevis jaunos apģērbos, bet gan spējā atdzīvināt un novērtēt to, kas jau ir sevi pierādījis kā izcilu. Vintage modes pieaugums: Aicinājums uz apzinātu patēriņu Umas Tūrmanes izvēle atspoguļo plašāku un arvien pieaugošu tendenci modes pasaulē: vintage apģērbu popularitāti uz sarkanā paklāja. Šī tendence, ko veicina tādi stilisti kā Lau Ročs (Law Roach) un tādas zvaigznes kā Zendaja (Zendaya) un Kendala Dženere (Kendall Jenner), ir kļuvusi par veidu, kā izcelties un paust nostāju. Tas nav tikai jauns modes kliedziens; tas ir daudzslāņains fenomens, ko virza vairāki būtiski faktori. Pirmkārt, tā ir alkas pēc individualitātes un unikalitātes. Ātrās modes laikmetā, kurā tūkstošiem cilvēku valkā līdzīgus apģērbus no masveida ražošanas, vintage piedāvā iespēju atrast patiesi oriģinālus, bieži vien ar rokām darinātus vai ierobežotās tirāžās radītus gabalus. Tie stāsta savu stāstu, nes sevī pagātnes atbalsis un ļauj to valkātājam justies īpašam. Otrkārt, tas ir spēcīgs solis ilgtspējības virzienā. Modes industrija ir viena no lielākajām piesārņotājām pasaulē, kas patērē milzīgus ūdens un enerģijas resursus, kā arī rada milzīgu atkritumu daudzumu. Izvēloties vintage, slavenības sūta skaidru vēstījumu par apzinātu patēriņu un resursu saglabāšanu. Tā ir atbilde uz augošo vides apziņu un vēlmi samazināt modes ekoloģisko pēdu. Atkārtoti izmantojot un novērtējot jau radīto, mēs veicinām aprites ekonomiku un samazinām pieprasījumu pēc jauniem, bieži vien neētiskos apstākļos ražotiem apģērbiem. Treškārt, vintage ir saistīts ar nostalģiju un vēstures novērtējumu. Šīs drēbes nav vienkārši “vecas”; tās ir archīva pērles, kas atspoguļo konkrētus periodus modes dizainā, kultūrā un sabiedrībā. Valkājot tās, slavenības ne tikai godina pagātnes dizainerus un meistarību, bet arī veido tiltu starp dažādiem modes laikmetiem, pierādot, ka patiesais skaistums ir pārejošs. Modes ietekme un zvaigžņu atbildība Zvaigžņu izvēlēm uz sarkanā paklāja ir milzīga ietekme uz globālajām modes tendencēm un patērētāju uzvedību. Kad tāda ikona kā Uma Tūrmane izvēlas vintage, tas nav tikai individuāls lēmums; tas ir publisks paziņojums, kas iedvesmo miljoniem cilvēku. Tas liek aizdomāties par ātrās modes ēnas pusēm – par tās ietekmi uz vidi, par strādnieku tiesībām, par pārmērīgu patēriņu....",2025-07-01 22:41:00,lv,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,LLM analysis,Medium,5.273350238800049,False

Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh.

Hai nghi phạm, một đế chế hàng giả trị giá tỷ đô Ẩn mình giữa những dãy nhà cao tầng sầm uất của Manhattan, một mạng lưới buôn bán hàng hiệu giả tinh vi đã tồn tại và vận hành âm thầm trong nhiều năm. Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng.

Vibe reported that the heated confrontation occurred on the steps of the courthouse, where 23-year-old Scott faces charges stemming from the 2021 death of 47-year-old Darius Guillebeaux. According to People magazine, Scott was arraigned in June 2024 on a seven-count indictment, including first and second-degree murder, reckless endangerment, and four counts of criminal possession of a weapon. What happened between Jazmin Dior and Remy Ma? The Shade Room posted a video Jazmin Dior shared of the dispute after she approached the Bronx rapper. In the clip, she accused Remy Ma of “trying to act tough” and told her to “go around the corner,” implying that she wanted to confront the 45-year-old physically without involving law enforcement. After Dior called her out, the “Conceited” artist appeared unfazed by her comments and responded, “Come on, beat me up,” as she walked down the steps and set her belongings down before the video ended. While there is no confirmation that the pair fought physically, a separate clip showed Remy Ma being handcuffed and escorted by police officers. As of now, the reason for her detention remains unknown. In a follow-up post, Dior candidly shared her side of the story, saying, “You would have thought I did something to you,” she said in the clip to Remy Ma, stating that the rapper did not appear to be remorseful over Scott's actions. “Realistically, I can never speak to my father again. You can see your son.” Dior also accused the MC of staring at her “with a whole attitude… as if her son was the victim. Like miss, where's your remorse?” she asked. Scott's alleged role in the 2021 murder case, explained Prosecutors allege that Scott was hired to kill Guillebeaux in Queens on June 7, 2021, and shot him multiple times, including after he had already fallen, AllHipHop and Blavity reported. Richard Swygert, 22, who is accused of conspiring with Scott, faces similar charges and is already imprisoned for a separate 2021 killing. After a probe into the incident, investigators arrested both Scott and Swygert on June 18, 2024, as they determined that they were both involved in the shooting based on surveillance and phone records. Remy Ma has supported her son through his legal issues Since then, Remy Ma has supported her son through his legal proceedings. At the time, a spokesperson for the rapper released a statement regarding the charges against Scott. “As many have heard, Remy Ma's son, Jayson Scott was recently arrested and very serious unfounded allegations have been made,” the statement read, per People. “Remy Ma wished to address this situation personally, but has been strongly advised by our office not to say anything publicly — as most people in this situation are, as the case is still active. To be clear, Jayson Scott is innocent and Remy Ma is committed to proving his innocence and fully supporting her child during this time.” If convicted, Scott faces life in prison without the possibility of parole.","Remy Ma was involved in an intense verbal exchange on June 24 at a courthouse in Queens, New York, with the daughter of the man her son, Jayson “Jace” Scott, is accused of murdering.

Hundreds of people are gathering outside the Palladium every night to watch Rachel Zegler belt 'Don't Cry for me Argentina' from the theatre balcony for free, a fun PR stunt that is getting so popular it risks being shut down by the police, while the ticketholders, some paying upwards of £245 per seat, have to settle for watching the performance via video link. And on opening night, Keanu Reeves, Jessica Alba and Pedro Pascal were some of the A-Listers sat metres from me who gave multiple standing ovations in the first act – not at the end, but half an hour into the show. It's common to see British acting titans at West End opening nights, but this random collection of A-Listers who aren't particularly known for theatre showed how far beyond the West End landscape this production has travelled. How come? It's from Jamie Lloyd, the zeitgeisty producer behind 2023's Sunset Boulevard, the man who is basically reinventing what West End shows can look like, so anything he does generates buzz. It also stars Rachel Zegler, who was most famously racially abused for playing Snow White. Lloyd uses live video effects and radical aesthetics (think the lighting and set design from a Wembley Arena pop show) to make the point that theatre can be bigger, louder and more ambitious. But where Sunset Boulevard was more of a gentle character study, Evita is primarily a series of phenomenal ensemble numbers. Ultimately it feels more like a music concert than conventional piece of theatrical storytelling. As for Zegler, with the straying of an eye or the tilt of her head, she finds depth in the Argentinian leader's story, finding warmth, confidence and vulnerability in the tragic figure. Evita is inspired by the real-life story of Eva Peron, a working class Argentinian who married leader Juan Peron and died of cervical cancer aged 33. She is viewed as a contradictory figure because she helped establish workers' rights and paid leave, and got women the vote, but also became an early Champagne socialist; for some, her love for Christian Dior dresses and the finer things in life felt at odds with her stance about equality. The show runs at three hours but feels half that because it is stuffed with utterly incredible choreography and the litany of musical numbers, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It's difficult to imagine that anything this stimulating has ever played in the West End before. And yet, I wasn't alone in finding Evita hard work. The outdated script introduces a range of historical characters without really putting them into context, or explaining their roles properly. The cast needs more space to tell the story with visual cues, but with barely any spoken lines – everything is delivered in verse as a rock opera – and a breakneck pace, the show is hard to follow for people who don't know the story well. I was relieved when, by the interval, multiple other journalists admitted to me they were finding the show hard to follow. It doesn't help that the production is also too loud, and when she sings Rachel Zegler's diction means she becomes difficult to understand. It's the same for the ensemble numbers: too often it's really difficult to catch what they're saying. It raises whole questions about accessibility, and the amount of knowledge audiences should come into shows with. Some critics will say cult musicals are designed for die-hard fans, but I tend to veer towards thinking shows should be able to be understood by newcomers. While this new production of Evita offers plenty of fresh thinking on the scope of the type of production values that are possible in these cranky, hundred-year-old theatres, I can't help but feel disappointed that so much of it went over my head.

Alene ordet ”taxfree” giver indtryk af, at varerne er billige at købe i lufthavnen – og danskerne har ” altid godt kunnet lide at spare penge. Københavns Lufthavn har lynende travlt her ved optakten til sommerferien. (Foto: Mads Aarmgaard / Københavns Lufthavn) De vil dog blive slemt skuffede, viser en ny analyse, som pris-sammenlignings-siden Pricerunner har foretaget i Københavns Lufthavn. Pricerunner har kigget på 20 populære varer og sammenlignet deres priser i lufthavnens taxfree med, hvad man kan købe dem for ude i det ”almindelige” Danmark. Analysen afslører, at 18 af de 20 varer er dyrere i lufthavnen. Køber man dem alle sammen, er prisen 1.488 kroner højere i lufthavnens taxfree. Ifølge Pricerunner kostede de 20 produkter i gennemsnit næsten 20 procent mindre uden for lufthavnen end inde i dens toldfri område. Solcreme er uundværlig for de fleste, når de tager på sommerferie nu. Tjek dog lige prisen i og uden for lufthavnen.

Her er prisen 229 kroner, mens buketten kan fås for 170 kroner hos en forhandler ude i Danmark. Denne slags butikker ser man mange af i lufthavne. (Foto: Pexels / Pixabay) Make-up og parfume er traditionelt også meget populære som taxfree. Det kan man tydeligt se, fordi de er placeret længst fremme og ved indgangen i lufthavnens store supermarkeder. Tager vi f.eks. den velkendte herreduft Emporio Armani Stronger with You EdP 50 ml, skal man betale 649 kroner for den lille flaske i Københavns Lufthavns taxfree. Uden for lufthavnen kan den købes 172 kroner billigere. Her i sommer er solcreme naturligvis uundværlig, men køb den hellere, inden I tager i lufthavnen. Her er bl.a.

Promising review: ""Love this collar, I wear crewnecks a lot and I wanted something to dress them up with. This def fits the bill!"" —Georgia W Get it from Amazon for $8.39+ (available in our colors and a two-pack). 2. Leave aerosol sprays and greasy roots in the past with I Dew Care dry shampoo. Just *tap, tap, tap* the little powderpuff where you need some oil control, and your 'do will look freshly-washed with the added perk of mega volume. Pro tip: Apply just a bit of product, brush it out, and repeat. Putting too much product at once may lead to a sheen of white residue. Promising review: ""I was looking for a dry shampoo that would be easy to use on the go for a trip I was taking. I had no issues taking this through TSA, and it was so easy to use on the go. You literally just pat the poof on your scalp and then rub the powder in. I do have black hair, so dry shampoo is usually very visible in my hair, but I didn't have any harder time than usual rubbing this powder in. It did a really good job of soaking up all the oil and giving my hair volume. I'm not a fan of the price for the amount that you get, but it is lasting longer than I thought it would. I would definitely recommend and will purchase again."" —Teresa Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in seven shades). 3. Upgrade your casual-just-getting-a-coffee wardrobe with an elevated cropped tank, one that has been blessed by a stylish fairy godmother. Why? This takes your basic cami and goes *poof. * Promising review: ""Don't hesitate, just buy it. I bought it in one color and as soon as I tried it on I purchased three more. The material is like butter. It doesn't have a built-in bra, but it's lined. You could put on a bra with this if you'd like but there's no need. It's cropped but still long enough that it doesn't roll up weirdly at the bottom. Can dress this up or down! I'll probably end up buying every color by the end of the year, it's just that incredible."" —Danijtate Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes S–XXL and 31 colors). 4. Trade your pajamas for an equally comfy (and errand-appropriate) lounge set. This one is made with a cozy waffle-knit material, ironic considering you'll adore this two-piece just as much as the doughy, syrup-drenched breakfast dessert. Promising review: ""I really like the fabric of this one and it's perfect for fall and winter in Texas. I love being comfy and still looking somewhat put together in this."" —Lily McAninch Get it from Amazon for $45.99+ (available in women's sizes S–XL and in 17 colors). 5. Pair a plain tee with high-waisted palazzo trousers, pants guaranteed to make you feel ~trendier than thou~ while you strut to your corner deli. These are available in neutral and vibrant hues alike, making it look as if you didn't snooze through your alarm this morning. Promising review: ""These pants as so comfortable and flowy! I stepped outside of my usual skinny jean outfit to try this style and I never want to take them off!

It did a really good job of soaking up all the oil and giving my hair volume. I'm not a fan of the price for the amount that you get, but it is lasting longer than I thought it would. I would definitely recommend and will purchase again."" —Teresa Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in seven shades). 3. Upgrade your casual-just-getting-a-coffee wardrobe with an elevated cropped tank, one that has been blessed by a stylish fairy godmother. Why? This takes your basic cami and goes *poof. * Promising review: ""Don't hesitate, just buy it. I bought it in one color and as soon as I tried it on I purchased three more. The material is like butter. It doesn't have a built-in bra, but it's lined. You could put on a bra with this if you'd like but there's no need. It's cropped but still long enough that it doesn't roll up weirdly at the bottom. Can dress this up or down! I'll probably end up buying every color by the end of the year, it's just that incredible."" —Danijtate Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes S–XXL and 31 colors). 4. Trade your pajamas for an equally comfy (and errand-appropriate) lounge set. This one is made with a cozy waffle-knit material, ironic considering you'll adore this two-piece just as much as the doughy, syrup-drenched breakfast dessert. Promising review: ""I really like the fabric of this one and it's perfect for fall and winter in Texas. I love being comfy and still looking somewhat put together in this."" —Lily McAninch Get it from Amazon for $45.99+ (available in women's sizes S–XL and in 17 colors). 5. Pair a plain tee with high-waisted palazzo trousers, pants guaranteed to make you feel ~trendier than thou~ while you strut to your corner deli. These are available in neutral and vibrant hues alike, making it look as if you didn't snooze through your alarm this morning. Promising review: ""These pants as so comfortable and flowy! I stepped outside of my usual skinny jean outfit to try this style and I never want to take them off! They are great casual pants for work, and can be dressed up for the evening with a fancy shirt and heels. They are as comfortable as pajamas, without looking like it :)"" —Nash...",2025-07-02 02:31:04,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The provided content is a generic product review list about various Amazon items like dry shampoo, clothing, and accessories.

Suchst du aktuell nach einer Duftkomposition, die dich an einen Ort der Erholung und der Sinnlichkeit entführt? Dann haben wir genau das Richtige für dich. Wir verraten dir, welche sechs Sommerdüfte aktuell beliebt sind und sich auf jeder Wunschliste wiederfinden sollten. #1 „Nivea Creme“ von Nivea Mit dem Duft „Nivea Creme“ gibt es die klassische und beliebte Nivea Creme auch als Eau de Toilette. Der Duft wurde erstmals im Jahr 2011 lanciert und ist seither unverändert geblieben. Sein frischer Zitrusduft und seine sanften Lavendelnoten verleihen ihm eine unverkennbare Frische. Darüber hinaus betört das Parfum mit einer erhabenen Präsenz – damit wird der Unisex-Duft dem Hype gerecht und ist eines unserer Sommer-Staples. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #2 „Nivea Sun“ von Nivea Suchst du einen leichten und angenehmen Unisex-Duft für die warmen Sommertage, ist „Nivea Sun“ von Nivea dein Duft. Das trendy Eau de Toilette bietet ein erfrischendes Dufterlebnis, das an warme Sommertage am Meer erinnert. Sinnlich und aufregend gehalten, verschmilzt der Zitrus-Cocktail mit einem Bouquet aus Blumen sowie mit würzig holzigen Akkorden, welche ein sensuelles und verführerisches Gefühl erwecken. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #3 „Boss The Scent“ von Hugo Boss „Boss The Scent“ von Hugo Boss ist ein Parfum für die facettenreiche Frau. Der im Jahr 2016 lancierte Duft ist das Gegenstück zum gleichnamigen Herrenparfum und seither für seine sinnliche und verführerische Wirkung beliebt. Raffiniert und feminin in seiner Komposition, ist er eine Hommage an die selbstsichere und elegante Frau und vereint geschickt saftigen Pfirsich mit blumiger Osmanthusblüte. Abschließend bildet sinnlicher, weißer Moschus eine subtile, aber hinreißende Duftnuance, welche das Eau de Parfum zu einem Must-have der Saison macht. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. Schönheitsideale im Wandel der Zeit Schönheitsideale im Wandel der Zeit #4 „The One“ von Calvin Klein Der Duft „The One“ von Calvin Klein ist ein aromatisch-zitrischer und frischer Unisex-Duft für den Sommer. Das Eau de Toilette entzückt mit einer sauberen Komposition aus frischem, grünen Tee sowie floralen Rosen und Veilchen und rundet das Dufterlebnis mit einem sanften Abschluss aus sinnlichem Moschus und holzig verführerischer Ambra ab. Unaufdringlich und perfekt für den Alltag! Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #5 „Hypnotic Poison“ von Christian Dior Für alle, die im Sommer intensivere Düfte bevorzugen, ist „Hypnotic Poison“ von Christian Dior die perfekte Wahl. In der Kopfnote sorgt der orientalische Duft für einen frischen und saftig-pflaumigen Auftakt, während sich im Herzen ein florales Zusammenspiel aus Jasmin- und Rosenakkorden entfaltet. Die Basisnote umhüllt dich schließlich in eine sanft betörende und würzige Wolke aus Moschus, Sandelholz und Vanille – so kennen und lieben wir den traumhaft, verführerischen Signatur-Duft von Dior. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #6 „Light Blue“ von Dolce & Gabbana Unser last but not the least: „Light Blue“ von Dolce & Gabbana ist eine moderne Interpretation des klassischen Zitronenduftes. Das Eau de Toilette entführt dich an das belebende Mittelmeer und entfaltet ein leichtes und entspanntes Lebensgefühl.

Peach Slices Redness Relief Color Correcting Cream for those days when your skin seems to be pitching a fit about something or another. This not only provides soothing, moisturizing ingredients like aloe and green algae, but it also has a subtle color-correcting tint that tones down redness. Think of it as a little tube of damage control for when your skin needs extra TLC. Promising review: ""I'm not one to normally leave reviews, but this is worth it. I've literally had this product for two days. I have severe rosacea on my nose. It's so bad I usually have to wear foundation to hide it because it's so noticeable. I've tried numerous products and serums with no luck, and honestly, I didn't expect this one to be any different. However, after only two days (probably applying it 4–5 times), almost all of the redness is gone! I'm in disbelief at the wonders it has done. I will without a doubt be stocking up on this product!"" —Tiffany Price: $19.88 2. Neutrogena Collagen Bank Facial Moisturizer that's basically an investment in your future face. Collagen helps keep things pinchably plump, bouncy, and glowy, which is great. But the real power player in this cream is the bakuchiol — an active ingredient which can boost cell turnover and smooth skin texture — which is basically retinol's less dramatic cousin. No joke, this study suggests that bakuchiol is just as effective as retinol while being way less likely to cause irritation. So basically, you get all the glow with none of the drama. It's a win-win.

mov_288F8824BE84655A34B1E28FF396C022,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Rihanna proudly displayed her bare baby bump on Wednesday, as she arrived at the Royal Monceau Hotel in Paris with her youngest son Riot by her side. The music superstar, 37, is currently pregnant with her third child with rapper boyfriend A$AP Rocky, with the couple already parents to sons RZA, three, and Riot, 23 months. She announced her exciting baby news in typically dramatic form, revealing her blossoming bump at May's Met Gala, where A$AP served one of the co-chairs. This week saw Rihanna enjoying a rare public outing with little Riot in the French capital, before the mother-and-son duo returned to their hotel. The hitmaker bared her growing bump in a cropped polo shirt teamed with a pair of very oversized cargo pants, and ballerina flats. While she toted the newly redesigned Book Tote from Dior, based on the first edition cover of Dracula by Bram Stoker. Doting on her youngest child, Rihanna beamed as she held tightly onto Riot's hand, while the adorable tot didn't hide his annoyance at the surrounding cameras. Her latest outing comes just days after boyfriend A$AP appeared to accidentally let slip the gender of their unborn child. The rapper was asked if the couple were set to have daughter after previously welcoming two boys, while attending the world premiere of Rihanna's new film, Smurfs, in Brussels on Sunday. On the blue carpet, Entertainment Tonight asked: 'Is that the girl you've been waiting for', A$AP immediately confirming: 'It is, man, it is.' The Everyday chart-topper - whose real name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers - then held up a plush Smurfette doll and added: 'Right here, you know what I'm saying? Right here.' But in response to the same question, Rihanna merely smiled coyly and replied: 'Let's see if it's a Smurfette...It could be a Papa Smurf. Who knows?' However, the singer did confirm that the couple would give their next child a name that begins with R, like their first two, adding: 'That's the one thing me and Rocky don't fight over.' When asked how many more children they planned on having, A$AP joked: 'We [are] going to be like the Wayans' family, you know? Yeah, I mean, love is beautiful and it's just [about] spreading it.' The power couple - who share matching 1988 tattoos to mark their birth year - originally met in 2011 when Rihanna first enlisted A$AP to rap on her song Cockiness (Love It). While they were romantically linked in 2013, after he after opened up for her Diamonds World Tour, they first confirmed their relationship in May 2021, when A$AP told GQ Rihanna was 'the love of my life'. Rihanna both produced and starred in Paramount Animation's Smurfs, playing the voice role of Smurfette - along with writing and recording original songs like Friend Of Mine. Smurfette was previously voiced by the billionaire's rival pop stars Katy Perry and Demi Lovato. Chris Miller's animated film will also feature Nick Offerman, Natasha Lyonne, JP Karliak, Dan Levy, Amy Sedaris, Nick Kroll, James Corden, Octavia Spencer, Hannah Waddingham, Sandra Oh, Alex Winter, Billie Lourd, Xolo Maridueña, Kurt Russell, and John Goodman. A$AP also took on an acting role as Yung Felony in Spike Lee's critically-acclaimed neo-noir crime thriller Highest 2 Lowest, which hits US theaters August 22 before streaming on Apple TV+ starting September 5. But there is still no release date for the New York native's long-delayed fourth studio album, Don't Be Dumb.","Have YOU got a story?

The music superstar, 37, is currently pregnant with her third child with rapper boyfriend A$AP Rocky, with the couple already parents to sons RZA, three, and Riot, 23 months. She announced her exciting baby news in typically dramatic form, revealing her blossoming bump at May's Met Gala, where A$AP served one of the co-chairs. This week saw Rihanna enjoying a rare public outing with little Riot in the French capital, before the mother-and-son duo returned to their hotel. The hitmaker bared her growing bump in a cropped polo shirt teamed with a pair of very oversized cargo pants, and ballerina flats. While she toted the newly redesigned Book Tote from Dior, based on the first edition cover of Dracula by Bram Stoker. Doting on her youngest child, Rihanna beamed as she held tightly onto Riot's hand, while the adorable tot didn't hide his annoyance at the surrounding cameras. Her latest outing comes just days after boyfriend A$AP appeared to accidentally let slip the gender of their unborn child. The rapper was asked if the couple were set to have daughter after previously welcoming two boys, while attending the world premiere of Rihanna's new film, Smurfs, in Brussels on Sunday. On the blue carpet, Entertainment Tonight asked: 'Is that the girl you've been waiting for', A$AP immediately confirming: 'It is, man, it is.' The Everyday chart-topper - whose real name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers - then held up a plush Smurfette doll and added: 'Right here, you know what I'm saying? Right here.' But in response to the same question, Rihanna merely smiled coyly and replied: 'Let's see if it's a Smurfette...It could be a Papa Smurf. Who knows?' However, the singer did confirm that the couple would give their next child a name that begins with R, like their first two, adding: 'That's the one thing me and Rocky don't fight over.' When asked how many more children they planned on having, A$AP joked: 'We [are] going to be like the Wayans' family, you know? Yeah, I mean, love is beautiful and it's just [about] spreading it.' The power couple - who share matching 1988 tattoos to mark their birth year - originally met in 2011 when Rihanna first enlisted A$AP to rap on her song Cockiness (Love It). While they were romantically linked in 2013, after he after opened up for her Diamonds World Tour, they first confirmed their relationship in May 2021, when A$AP told GQ Rihanna was 'the love of my life'. Rihanna both produced and starred in Paramount Animation's Smurfs, playing the voice role of Smurfette - along with writing and recording original songs like Friend Of Mine. Smurfette was previously voiced by the billionaire's rival pop stars Katy Perry and Demi Lovato. Chris Miller's animated film will also feature Nick Offerman, Natasha Lyonne, JP Karliak, Dan Levy, Amy Sedaris, Nick Kroll, James Corden, Octavia Spencer, Hannah Waddingham, Sandra Oh, Alex Winter, Billie Lourd, Xolo Maridueña, Kurt Russell, and John Goodman. A$AP also took on an acting role as Yung Felony in Spike Lee's critically-acclaimed neo-noir crime thriller Highest 2 Lowest, which hits US theaters August 22 before streaming on Apple TV+ starting September 5.

788194AC4F6EE38BAA09391FD01E85A6,"  In a 49-page lawsuit filed in California, Lululemon accused the retail wholesaler of selling knockoff versions of its Scuba clothing and popular ABC men's pants. For nearly as long as mankind has worn fancy things, someone out there has been trying to copy those things. Ancient artisans cribbed from each other's designs. Victorian hustlers duped diamond jewelry with shimmery paste. Christian Dior, the godfather of high fashion himself, was believed to sell his own designs to lesser known producers, who could make cheaper versions. For the modern athleisure giant Lululemon, however, the duping has gone too far. In a lawsuit filed in California on June 25, the company accused the wholesale retailer Costco of selling knockoff sweatshirts, jackets and other activewear at a fraction of what Lululemon charges. Successfully suing over knockoffs is notoriously difficult for fashion brands and designers, in part because copyright laws are often vague, experts say. Lululemon's case seeks restitution and payment from Costco, which it said profited off Lululemon's ''sweat equity'' and damaged the Lululemon brand. Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. What is Lululemon accusing Costco of doing? Lululemon said Costco is selling knockoffs of its Scuba hoodies and sweatshirts, Define jackets and popular ABC pants for men. Using design images and side-by-side comparisons, Lululemon, in a 49-page court filing, argued that Costco sold jackets and hoodies -- made by clothing manufacturers such as Danskin, Spyder and Jockey -- using terms in its marketing similar to what Lululemon uses. In one instance cited in the lawsuit, Costco sold a turquoise Danskin-made pullover -- which at a glance looks remarkably similar to Lululemon's Scuba sweatshirt -- with the color ''Tidewater Teal.'' It's the same way Lululemon describes the color of its own teal sweatshirts. Lululemon also accuses Costco of manufacturing a knockoff of its ABC pants -- which retail for about $130 -- under Costco's own brand, Kirkland, and selling them for $20. Contracts between vendors like Danskin and Jockey and retailers like Costco often include provisions like indemnification clauses, which can specify that vendors bear financial responsibility for legal issues that could arise from their products. It's unclear whether such clauses exist in this case. How has Lululemon dealt with dupes? Lululemon, with its unadorned styles and high prices, is famously a target for knockoffs. Hashtags on TikTok direct shoppers to cheap, duped versions of the brand's leggings and athletic wear. Since Lululemon's inception in Canada in 1998, fashion law experts in America say that the brand has been on the forefront of design trademark law, which is famously lax in the United States as compared to other markets, like Europe. ''They absolutely have been on the forefront of trying to find ways to protect their intellectual property,'' said Susan Scafidi, the founder and director of the Fashion Law Institute at the Fordham School of Law. Protecting trademarks, logos and labels is one thing. Protecting the design of a garment is another.'' ''In Europe that's easy. Design rights, done,'' said Ms. Scafidi. '' In the U.S., well in Lululemon terms, they have to warm up and stretch.'' Still, dupes are enough of a concern that Lululemon held several ''dupe'' exchanges in 2023, offering holders of confirmed ''dupe'' leggings to bring their clothes to designated sites and trade them for the real thing. At the time, Nikki Neuburger, Lululemon's chief branding officer, said it was an effort to acknowledge ''dupes'' as part of fashion while protecting the original producer. ''We saw it as a really fun way to play into something that is a real part of our culture, but in a way that really puts the focus back on the original,'' Ms. Neuburger told CNN. What is 'dupe' culture? Many millennials probably recall a school or family trip to New York City in the 2000s, when a coveted status symbol of adolescence was a pair of sunglasses or a candy-colored knockoff designer purse, bought after haggling with a vendor on Canal Street. But today's dupe market has gone digital, and TikTok has become a prime platform. Videos with the ''dupe'' hashtag have billions of views on the platform. For many in Gen Z, good dupes have become almost as coveted as originals. Many influencers promote knockoffs of Stanley mugs, Lululemon pants, sneakers and designer jewelry. ''Dupes are not only out there in the open, they are a point of pride. These are the modern versions of being an extreme coupon clipper or a bargain hunter, and it has lost a lot of its shame,'' Ms. Scafidi said. But designers are increasingly trying to stamp out knockoffs, and take back brands' power. In November 2024, Sol de Janeiro sued over dupes of its popular scented mist sprays. The year before that, Deckers, which owns the Ugg boot brand, sued over dupes of its ankle shearling boot. This May, Deckers sued Costco over the same thing, claiming the retailer's far cheaper Shearling slippers were a direct copy of the UGG equivalent. If the Lululemon suit succeeds, Ms. Scafidi said, it could rewind some of that clock, making original designer versions once again palatable. ''Lulu is trying to buy back some of that territory,'' Ms. Scafidi said. If they win, ''that will be a huge social victory.''","In a 49-page lawsuit filed in California, Lululemon accused the retail wholesaler of selling knockoff versions of its Scuba clothing and popular ABC men's pants.

Why Autumn Fair Is Introducing Content in 2025: Equipping Retailers for What's Next Soraya Gadelrab, Event Director at Autumn Fair says, “We know your time at Autumn Fair is precious, and for most of you, buying comes first. But we also know that in today's fast-moving retail landscape, it's harder than ever to stay ahead while juggling rising costs, shifting consumer behaviours, and constant digital change. That's why for Autumn Fair 2025, we're introducing a powerful new content agenda that's practical, focused, and easy to consume, designed to fit around your buying and deliver maximum value in minimal time. “We're not adding content for content's sake. This is about giving you real-world strategies and actionable insights that can make a genuine difference to your business, from marketing on a shoestring, to making your store unmissable, to understanding the trends your customers will care about next. These are short, impactful sessions that respect your time and focus on what matters: helping you buy smarter, sell better, and future-proof your business, all while staying connected to the wider retail community facing the same challenges.” Highlights from the Autumn Fair 2025 Agenda include: Inspirational Keynotes & Conversations Harriet Hastings, CEO and Creative Director from The Biscuiteers shares her journey from kitchen table to luxury gifting empire.

mov_0E38685FDFA51F6B7EF2BBA08A8C5A74,"  Paris Men's Fashion Week 2025 arrived with a quiet confidence. This summer season is defined less by spectacle and more by nuance. From Pharrell's global diplomacy at Louis Vuitton to Jonathan Anderson's subtle reimagining of Dior heritage, the collections echoed a world in motion yet craving calm. Craftsmanship met technology, tradition bowed to innovation, and desire found expression in restraint. This was a moment of elegance and thoughtful reinvention — the kind of fashion that invites reflection and adventure. Here's KHAMSA's roundup of the names that shaped the week. ١. LOUIS VUITTON – Le Monde est à Vous [embedded content] For his third collection at Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams staged a show on the rooftop of UNESCO in Paris, where diplomacy met design. A Damier-printed runway designed in collaboration with Bijoy Jain of Studio Mumbai. The collaboration set the tone for a cross-cultural vision that paid tribute to India's dress codes and craftsmanship. Dubbed “Le Monde est à Vous” (The World is Yours), the collection fused tailored safari silhouettes, cricket jerseys, and a new “damoflage” print in a palette of earthy saffron, khaki, and ivory. Embellished trunks, turbans, and luxe monogrammed cargos signaled a shift toward ornate utility. With live music by AR Rahman and Native Voices of Resistance, the show underscored Vuitton's message: global elegance grounded in heritage, movement, and meaning. ٢. DIOR – Jonathan Anderson's Debut Courtesy of Dior Courtesy of Dior Courtesy of Dior At the Hôtel des Invalides, Dior marked a new chapter as Jonathan Anderson unveiled his first menswear collection for the house. The designer, known for his sculptural work at JW Anderson and Loewe, brought a fresh irreverence to Dior's legacy, stripping back the theatricality of past seasons. Silhouettes nodded to the maison's archives — most notably the Bar jacket, here oversized and re-gendered — while loose cargo pants echoed couture gowns from the 1940s. The collection's quiet provocation lay in its restraint: historical references warped into modern utility, florals stitched as whispers, and tailoring that blurred between dressing up and dressing down. Set within a space modeled on Berlin's Gemäldegalerie, Anderson's debut redefined heritage as a structure to twist, not preserve. ٣. HERMÈS – Summer in the City Courtesy of Hermès Courtesy of Hermès At Hermès, Véronique Nichanian offered a study in air, light, and ease. The collection unfolded like a deep breath — technical yet sensual, refined yet grounded. Openwork leather traced clean lines across blousons and trousers, while a muted palette of putty, caramel, and mint gave way to richer tones like burgundy and vanilla. Shapes were fluid but never loose: shirt-jackets, cropped trousers, and soft parkas constructed with the precision of saddlery, but made to move. There was no spectacle here — only the subtle poetry of craftsmanship. This was summer not as a season, but as a texture: breathable, tactile, and wholly at peace with itself. Courtesy of Hermès ٤. SAINT LAURENT – Clinamen Courtesy of Saint Laurent Courtesy of Saint Laurent Courtesy of Saint Laurent Anthony Vaccarello's latest menswear show unfolded under dry afternoon light at the Bourse de Commerce, where stillness replaced spectacle. Inspired by a generation of artists who turned desire into form — and by Yves Saint Laurent's own 1974 retreat — the collection explored elegance through restraint. Waists were cinched, shoulders extended, and fabrics like silk and nylon floated close to the body without clinging. The palette, hushed and coastal, echoed sand, salt, and pale ochre. At the center of the space, porcelain bowls drifted in a circular basin — the Clinamen installation by Céleste Boursier-Mougenot — producing quiet collisions that mirrored the show's mood. There were no grand gestures, only presence, held with intent. Courtesy of Saint Laurent ٥. KENZO – Club Kenzo...","Paris Men's Fashion Week 2025 arrived with a quiet confidence.

mov_40D9ED93ACFBB2479F426AE4E07D0E73,"  It's rare for a West End theatre production to garner so much attention and excitement before opening night, yet that is exactly what Rachel Zegler has managed to do as she steps into the shoes of Eva Perón in director Jamie Lloyd's daring take on the beloved musical, Evita. Over the last two weeks of preview shows, Zegler has stepped out on to the balcony of The London Palladium, the musical's new home, mid-performance to perform a powerful rendition of 'Don't Cry For Me, Argentina'. ' I don't think any of us expected it to garner as much attention as it did,' the 24-year-old actor reflects to ELLE UK, the morning after Evita's opening night. 'People have been camping out for hours before I go on and it's humbling, beautiful and fits in the story very well.' Starring as Perón, Zegler has received rave reviews for her passionate, high-voltage performance which follows the life of the Argentine political leader Juan Perón, and his second wife. The dynamic show, set to Andrew Lloyd Webber's soaring score, dominated social media during its preview period and has now officially opened its doors to London audiences. Pedro Pascal, Sarah Paulson and Keanu Reeves were among the high-profile guests at the Palladium on opening night to see Zegler belt out beloved ballads like 'Rainbow High' and 'A New Argentina'. 'Sarah texted me last week asking for the link to get tickets. I had no idea she meant last night,' Zegler exclaims. ' Then, our ensemble member Harrison Wilde asked me backstage, ""Rachel, is Pedro here? "" and I said he probably would have told me. Then, during 'Rainbow High', I saw Pedro stand up. I was like, ""Dad, you're embarrassing me! ""' she jokes. ' No, he was so sweet. Keanu Reeves was there, too. I was freaking out!' For the occasion, Zegler wore a SS25 beige tulle Haute Couture Dior ballgown adorned with bejewelled bows, designed by the house's recently departed creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri. On her look, Zegler worked closely with her long-time stylist Sarah Tooley to pay a visual tribute to her character's legacy. ' It was so evident to Sarah and I that Dior had to be a part of the night because of the lyrics of 'Rainbow High' being ""Christian Dior me from my head to my toes "",' she shares. 'Christian Dior was such an influence on Eva's fashion in real life, so we wanted to pay homage and have classic elements as well as the modern, diva and Madonna-esque version of Eva. That's why this design was so perfect.' Having worked with her since the start of Zegler's acting career, Tooley is a stylist she truly trusts. ' She knows my taste, but she also knows my body and what I'll feel comfortable in. That's a testament to the friendship and trust [we've] built,' Zegler reflects. Her look was finished with fine jewellery from London-based brands Ananya and David Morris, a fresh, glossy make-up look and her signature soft waves on the hair, styled by Valeria Ferreira and Dayaruci respectively. ' I want to look like myself as much as possible, so I can be myself in a professional sphere where a lot of pressure is on,' Zegler says of her glam approach. The opening night of Evita followed two weeks of preview shows, in which the production is tweaked nightly before it officially opens. ' That is both exhilarating and exhausting for an ensemble group of people, so it was such a wonderful experience to lock it and get the response we've had so far,' Zegler reflects. Still, one thing has remained consistent – the unprecedented reaction to the electric moment she leaves the stage and heads to the the theatre's balcony for the musical's most beloved number. 'It's brilliant,' Zegler says of the scene. ' The second Jamie said that's what he was trying to get permission from Westminster Council to do, I said ""We need to do anything to make that possibility real. "" But, as simple as it may seem, it's a huge production as there are a lot of technology and hard work involved to show the theatre inside the Palladium.' Zegler shares that audiences inside applaud nightly when they see the amount of people waiting outside as it's 'such a ridiculously impressive thing to pull off.' 'When we first performed it, it was just me in a robe and my wig to figure out the lighting and sound for the show. The odd person would stop and take a picture, but the next day, it was 100 people, then 20o and it would double in size. It's overwhelming but really moving.' As for the critics, Zegler states there's deeper meaning behind the spectacle. ' It's a testament to the fact that this show is based on history,' Zegler continues. ' Eva was a real person and there is no world in which she would want to impress people who could afford to see a show at a theatre. She wanted to bring her message to the streets and to the people. Jamie integrates the modern ingenuity of theatre by respecting the source material in such a way that serves such a beautiful purpose.' It's clear playing this role means a lot to Zegler. ' It's a dream come true. I haven't been on stage in a musical since high school [for Shrek The Musical, famously] and I missed it so much... When you get to live your dream, you don't take any second for granted and I'm not, I'm soaking in every second....","It's rare for a West End theatre production to garner so much attention and excitement before opening night, yet that is exactly what Rachel Zegler has managed to do as she steps into the shoes of Eva Perón in director Jamie Lloyd's daring take on the beloved musical, Evita.

mov_3E7B54EBFBCE404FE724C963D393B0EC,"  The Starboard Group is seizing the moment. With the cruise industry experiencing a sustained rebound post-COVID-19, the Starboard Group, operator of boutiques aboard cruise liners and super yachts, has been rolling out new product initiatives and services ranging from personalizing jewelry and ear piercings, to tequila developed with the Invicta Watch Group. More from WWD Starboard also plans to launch a natural diamond program this fall, details of which will be revealed later this summer. “Cruising has never been more popular,” said Caryl Capeci, Starboard's senior vice president of fine jewelry and Swiss watches. “There was a stoppage of the cruise ships during COVID-19, and then it all came back. We've seen not only the number of passengers but also retail sales on cruise ships grow and grow and grow. And in June, we had record high sales volume.” During an interview Tuesday, Capeci cited statistics indicating the cruise industry is forecast to carry 37 million passengers in 2025, up from approximately 34.6 million last year, with expectations to reach 42 million by 2028. So an opportunity to capture greater wallet share from more passengers on board cruise ships exists. Last year, Starboard cruise line shops generated an estimated $800 million to under $1 billion, according to sources. Capeci declined to confirm the figure though she characterized Starboard's 2024 volume as in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Starboard works with 14 cruise lines, including Royal Caribbean, Virgin Voyages and Carnival Cruise Line, and more than 95 different cruise ships selling everything from beauty, fragrance and liquor to apparel, Swiss watches and fine and fashion jewelry. Through its cruise and luxury division, Starboard operates single-brand shops, as well as multibrand shops on ships. Among the brand shops are Omega, Brietling, Tag Heuer, Bulgari, Hublot, Cartier, IWC, Panerai, Piaget, Messika, Swarovski and Pandora. Also sold are beauty brands such as Dior, Chanel, Lancome, Clinique, Estée Lauder, Clarins and La Mer. Shops range from 100 to 750 square feet. The merchandise in the Starboard shops is duty free and tax free. Among the initiatives Capeci cited: Boutiques for Cartier, IWC Schaffhausen and Piaget aboard Luminara, the newest super yacht in The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, which was launched this week. The boutiques offer Swiss timepieces, fine jewelry and accessories, as well as private viewings, in-suite appointments and sessions with brand ambassadors to explore the craftsmanship and heritage of the brands. Also on offer are designer jewelry, luxury accessories and resortwear — from vintage Hermès bags and Stella McCartney handbags to fine jewelry by Ileana Makri, Lauren Rubinski and Sydney Evan. Ear piercing in partnership with Inverness, the ear piercing system, has been set up on 33 ships across multiple cruise lines in the past couple of months. Starboard says “expertly trained retail team members” administer the piercings. The debut of Invicta Tequila is for sale exclusively aboard 26 cruise ships worldwide, produced for the Invicta Watch Group by Mexico's Casa Maestri Distillery. Onboard tastings and personalized activations are offered. Engraving stations for personalizing jewelry are being set up. Mail-order services for most of the jewelry and watch brands sold at Starboard shops began rolling out in mid-May. Passengers can view digital catalogues on iPads to select styles, ring sizes or colors that not on the ship and have them shipped home. Rolling out financing through FlexPay with interest free, interest bearing and buy now, pay later options. The rollout began four months ago on Carnival and is being extended to all Starboard cruise line partners. “Most guests on cruises are celebrating something with their loved ones, whether it's a birthday, an anniversary or a family milestone so they come with a desire to splurge, to discover new brands and items connected to the destination they're traveling to,” Capeci said. “But most importantly, they want to mark the time with something meaningful, and we all know that jewelry and timepieces are among the most special ways to mark an event or a vacation, and remember time spent together with loved ones. For those reasons, most voyages we sell on do quite a nice business in fine jewelry. Fine jewelry and watches are probably 40 percent or more of our total sales. It's very significant.” Sales at Starboard's cruise line boutiques are selling at much higher rate than pre-COVID-19, globally, with the exception of China, Capeci said. “Pre-COVID, we did a significant business on ships sailing out of Shanghai and mainland China. That market has not returned. “The largest region in terms of retail value and sales is the Caribbean by far because of the sheer number of passengers that sail in the Caribbean and the size of the ships,” Capeci said. Cruises in Alaska and the Mediterranean, particularly summertime, also generate “very significant” business. Asked what's selling best, Capeci said: “Diamonds are huge. Yellow gold is huge. Materials that are connected to the destinations they travel to are very important. So if they're going to Australia, they want opals. If they're going to South America, they want green emeralds. The destination they're traveling to and the jewelry that we're offering are always connected. You could buy emeralds at home, but it's not as meaningful as it is when you just visited that location of their origin.” The Invicta brand, founded in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, in 1837, “is one of our most successful and longest running partners for watches,” Capeci said. “They're moving into more lifestyle-driven programs....","The Starboard Group is seizing the moment.

FULL TEXT A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside - and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power. Inside, dove-gray velvet lined the walls of a temporary event space and displayed two rare 18th-century oils by Jean Siméon Chardin on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland and the Louvre. Robert Pattinson gossiped with Josh O'Connor. Donatella Versace schmoozed with Roger Federer. A pregnant Rihanna arrived with ASAP Rocky a mere 45 minutes after the official start time. That's how much anticipation there was for the Dior men's show. The filmmaker Luca Guadagnino was even trailing around to document the moment. It was Jonathan Anderson's debut as the creative director/savior of the house, the first designer to be put in charge of both men's and women's wear. And under all the buzz, a giant question mark hovered: Could the former Loewe wunderkind reignite excitement not just in the brand but in fashion? Mr. Anderson made it look easy. Literally. Beginning with his take on the Bar jacket, the most famous Dior women's wear shape - the one that prompted the Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow to jump out of her seat shrieking, ""It's a New Look!"" in 1947. It was reimagined in a Donegal tweed with a flat back and a whiff of the hourglass at the front, as if it retained a vague memory of what it once was. With it, he paired not a shirt but a stiff white stock collar and a pair of oversize white cotton cargo shorts, each side sporting elaborate folds to create the plumped out silhouette of a goose, or a 1948 couture dress called the Delft. Go on, shake your tail feathers. If little Lord Fauntleroy had spent a year at U.S.C. and then returned for a pickup game of basketball at Versailles, this is how he might dress. It was not a capital N New Look. It wasn't that radical, or shocking. But it was an awfully charming newish one. And it was situated smack in the middle of the tension between formality and informality, men's wear and women's wear, commerce and creativity (Mr. Anderson's own work at Loewe and Uniqlo and what he inherited at Dior), which seems to define this particular moment. No one is all one thing or another. Neither are their clothes. Neither are the totems of wealth. What Mr. Anderson proposed was a clear and convincing argument that contradictions can gracefully coexist. Most of all, he put forward the belief that fashion and wearability are not irreconcilable ideas - that you either have to look bizarro or look boring. For every highfalutin garment there was an equal and opposite this-old-thing, usually worn together. Velvet frock coats were paired with faded jeans in Japanese denim. Olive green puffer coats and down vests were cut with trapeze backs. The exact pattern of another classic Dior dress, the Caprice, with its elaborately swathed peplum skirt, was applied to a pair of loose khakis, giving one leg the fillip of a drape.

mov_2CCEF76AD199EDB8C9E6E24FF8B7DBCB,"  1. Rise in Fashion Industry Enforcement as Green Claims Directive Stalls In recent years, legislative initiatives have increasingly reflected the green agenda and sustainability objectives of the European Commission (the Commission). Authorities have been paying closer attention to unfair commercial practices, including the dissemination of inaccurate corporate responsibility disclosures and false or exaggerated environmental claims. The fashion industry has emerged as a key focus area, with national agencies across Europe intensifying efforts to investigate greenwashing, deceptive labeling, and misleading ethical assertions, especially concerning labour practices. In the past month or so, two pivotal developments unfolded: The first one took place on 25 May 2025, when the Commission formally joined forces with several national competition authorities in urging the online fashion giant SHEIN to comply with EU consumer protection laws. The request followed a coordinated investigation that uncovered suspected fake discounts, manipulation of reviews and ratings, deceptive product labels, and misleading sustainability claims. This joint enforcement action complements a separate, ongoing Commission investigation under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The DSA imposes heightened due diligence obligations aimed at ensuring transparency and consumer trust in digital markets on very large online platforms (VLOPs), and SHEIN was designated a VLOP in April 2024. The second development occurred just last week, when the Commission announced - and later clarified - its intention to withdraw support for the Green Claims Directive (GCD) unless the Council's proposed amendment to include 30 million micro-enterprises within its scope was removed. Micro-enterprises are defined as companies with fewer than 10 employees and less than €2 million in revenue. Originally unveiled in March 2023, the GCD aimed to protect consumers from misleading environmental marketing by requiring companies to have their green claims independently verified. The final text of the Directive had been expected imminently. The Commission's reversal is formally grounded in concerns that the Directive, as amended, would impose a disproportionate administrative burden on small businesses. At the same time, there is growing concern that the GCD's stringent requirements could inadvertently discourage companies from communicating their environmental efforts—a phenomenon known as 'greenhushing'—or worse, deter them from pursuing sustainability initiatives altogether. The uncertainty surrounding the future of the GCD should not be interpreted, without more, as a rollback of the EU's broader sustainability agenda. Rather than signaling a retreat from environmental regulation, the Commission's recent move reflects a recalibration of scope and priorities. It is now up to the co-legislators to consider the Commission's position and renegotiate the Directive's scope. Importantly, the rest of the EU's green regulatory framework—including measures targeting greenwashing—remains intact and continues to advance. We recall that just last year, the Commission adopted two key green directives that embed sustainability into the EU's regulatory fabric. The first is designed to empower consumers during the green transition, strengthening safeguards against unfair commercial practices and ensuring access to reliable, verifiable product information. The second introduces more robust requirements around corporate sustainability reporting, reinforcing transparency and accountability. Member states have until next year to transpose both directives into national law, after which enforcement — particularly around deceptive green claims — is expected to intensify. 2. Reform Milestones As consumer scrutiny of ethical and environmental claims intensifies, the EU has rolled out a series of landmark policies targeting greenwashing, unethical labour practices, and digital consumer risks — particularly in high-impact sectors like fashion. Here is how the regulatory landscape has evolved in recent years: 3. Overview of Investigations Targeting Greenwashing and Unfair Practices Across Europe and the UK EU Investigates SHEIN and Temu Over Online Practices and Consumer Risks The Commission's recent enforcement action against SHEIN underscores the importance and gravity the EU attaches to greenwashing, false ethical claims, and other unfair practices. In this particular case, the Commission is investigating a variety of other SHEIN practices, which range from the presence of illegal goods and content on its platform to the opacity of its recommender system that influences the range of products recommended to users first, through a parallel, complementary DSA inquiry. The Commission has also asked the retailer to provide information on the measures adopted to mitigate risks relating to consumer protection, public health, users' well-being, and the processing of data. Another Chinese e-commerce giant, Temu, received a similar request for information, at the same time as SHEIN, after receipt of a consumer complaint alleging that the exponential increase in Temu's user base is the result of aggressive marketing that may violate EU consumer protection laws, notably articles 7, 34, 35, 38, and 40 of the DSA.

From Armani to SHEIN: Italy Scrutinizes Green and Ethical Fashion Claims In July 2024, the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) initiated proceedings and carried out inspections at the premises of Giorgio Armani and Christian Dior for alleged breaches of the Italian Consumer Code in their advertising of clothing and accessories. The Dior probe was closed just last month without finding an infringement after the company gave a set of legally binding commitments designed to address any possible false statements in ethics and social responsibility statements. In September 2024, AGCM also launched an investigation against Infinite Styles for possible generic, vague, confusing, and/or misleading environmental claims made in relation to SHEIN's Italian website. The authority focused on the misleading use of unclear claims such as “'circularity'” and “'green' fibres,” lack of information on additional recyclability of the garment, and contradictions between the company's sustainability reports in previous years and its commitment to decarbonise. The CMA Tightens Scrutiny on Green Cla...","1. Rise in Fashion Industry Enforcement as Green Claims Directive Stalls In recent years, legislative initiatives have increasingly reflected the green agenda and sustainability objectives of the European Commission (the Commission). Authorities have been paying closer attention to unfair commercial practices, including the dissemination of inaccurate corporate responsibility disclosures and false or exaggerated environmental claims. The fashion industry has emerged as a key focus area, with national agencies across Europe intensifying efforts to investigate greenwashing, deceptive labeling, and misleading ethical assertions, especially concerning labour practices. In the past month or so, two pivotal developments unfolded: The first one took place on 25 May 2025, when the Commission formally joined forces with several national competition authorities in urging the online fashion giant SHEIN to comply with EU consumer protection laws. The request followed a coordinated investigation that uncovered suspected fake discounts, manipulation of reviews and ratings, deceptive product labels, and misleading sustainability claims. This joint enforcement action complements a separate, ongoing Commission investigation under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The DSA imposes heightened due diligence obligations aimed at ensuring transparency and consumer trust in digital markets on very large online platforms (VLOPs), and SHEIN was designated a VLOP in April 2024. The second development occurred just last week, when the Commission announced - and later clarified - its intention to withdraw support for the Green Claims Directive (GCD) unless the Council's proposed amendment to include 30 million micro-enterprises within its scope was removed. Micro-enterprises are defined as companies with fewer than 10 employees and less than €2 million in revenue. Originally unveiled in March 2023, the GCD aimed to protect consumers from misleading environmental marketing by requiring companies to have their green claims independently verified. The final text of the Directive had been expected imminently. The Commission's reversal is formally grounded in concerns that the Directive, as amended, would impose a disproportionate administrative burden on small businesses. At the same time, there is growing concern that the GCD's stringent requirements could inadvertently discourage companies from communicating their environmental efforts—a phenomenon known as 'greenhushing'—or worse, deter them from pursuing sustainability initiatives altogether. The uncertainty surrounding the future of the GCD should not be interpreted, without more, as a rollback of the EU's broader sustainability agenda. Rather than signaling a retreat from environmental regulation, the Commission's recent move reflects a recalibration of scope and priorities. It is now up to the co-legislators to consider the Commission's position and renegotiate the Directive's scope. Importantly, the rest of the EU's green regulatory framework—including measures targeting greenwashing—remains intact and continues to advance. We recall that just last year, the Commission adopted two key green directives that embed sustainability into the EU's regulatory fabric. The first is designed to empower consumers during the green transition, strengthening safeguards against unfair commercial practices and ensuring access to reliable, verifiable product information. The second introduces more robust requirements around corporate sustainability reporting, reinforcing transparency and accountability. Member states have until next year to transpose both directives into national law, after which enforcement — particularly around deceptive green claims — is expected to intensify. 2. Reform Milestones As consumer scrutiny of ethical and environmental claims intensifies, the EU has rolled out a series of landmark policies targeting greenwashing, unethical labour practices, and digital consumer risks — particularly in high-impact sectors like fashion. Here is how the regulatory landscape has evolved in recent years: 3. Overview of Investigations Targeting Greenwashing and Unfair Practices Across Europe and the UK EU Investigates SHEIN and Temu Over Online Practices and Consumer Risks The Commission's recent enforcement action against SHEIN underscores the importance and gravity the EU attaches to greenwashing, false ethical claims, and other unfair practices. In this particular case, the Commission is investigating a variety of other SHEIN practices, which range from the presence of illegal goods and content on its platform to the opacity of its recommender system that influences the range of products recommended to users first, through a parallel, complementary DSA inquiry. The Commission has also asked the retailer to provide information on the measures adopted to mitigate risks relating to consumer protection, public health, users' well-being, and the processing of data. Another Chinese e-commerce giant, Temu, received a similar request for information, at the same time as SHEIN, after receipt of a consumer complaint alleging that the exponential increase in Temu's user base is the result of aggressive marketing that may violate EU consumer protection laws, notably articles 7, 34, 35, 38, and 40 of the DSA. The company is under investigation for failure to ensure traceability of those trading on the platform; lack of transparency; and insufficient measures to protect minors and mitigate the risks stemming from the service's allegedly addictive design and illegal product listings.

Tony Robinson tells us about various global catastrophes which have often killed off the vast majority of life on Earth. Stephen Oppenheimer has a cool job title - Archaeo-Geneticist. He suggests that a super-volcano might have reduced the population of India to about 600 people. John Power has a cool job title (Volcanologist) as well as a cool name. Robert B Smith studies the Yellowstone caldera. Bill McGuire explains how Sulphur Dioxide is one of the deadly features of large volcanic eruptions. Prof. Ken Tankersley talks about the event that caused a mass extinction of ""mega mammals"" during the Clovis period. A layer of iron-heavy rock suggests an asteroid strike. Prof. Peter Schultz does experiments shooting heavy objects into a base of sand to test whether glaciers might have protected the Earth's surface, and preventing an asteroid strike forming a large, easily recognised crater. Ed Beshore looks for Near Earth Objects that might cause a catastrophic impact. Here's the whole programme. https://youtu.be/9ggh2iHIneM?si=rNBJPvyfhcgTYiuW  Media Centre Description: Tony Robinson investigates the theory that natural disasters and catastrophes have shaped evolution and enabled human life to flourish. An examination of the key events of the past 75,000 years, including the ice age and an asteroid strike in North America, and a look at the potential catastrophes that lie in wait. Recorded from Channel 4+1 on Monday 22nd December 2008 21:58  The last recording today is the first episode in a three part series of ghost stories for Christmas, Crooked House - The Wainscoting. A man brings an old door knocker to an antiques expert, and hears some ghost stories about the house it came from. Lee Ingleby plays the man, Ben. Mark Gatiss, who also wrote this, plays the ""Curator"". The first story concerns a Mr Joseph Bloxham, a man who has recently bought the house in question, Geap Manor and is having it modernised. He's also recently been involved in a financial ""bubble"", making money himself, but having seen many people lose everything when the scheme collapsed. He's played by Philip Jackson. Julian Rhind-Tutt plays his friend, Noakes, who takes him to task for his part of a scheme that led to at least one man going to debtor's prison. Andy Nyman plays his other friend Duncalfe. Bloxham is slightly annoyed that his workman who are modernising the house aren't going to be finished when they said they would. Mr Coil tells him ""I can only apologise, Mr Bloxham. But real craftsmanship cannot be rushed, sir. You wouldn't want that, would you?"" ""No, no, of course not."" ""I mean, you could get in any nickninnie to take on a job like this, but you'd regret it."" ""Yes, yes."" ""Well, you have my absolute assurance that my men and me will have quit the place by the end of October."" ""You swear it?"" ""Give or take."" Coil shows him the new wainscoting he's put in, with the very finest timber, as requested. Bloxham asks about some staining on the wood. ""And of course, the wainscoting will soon be painted, will it not? A nice sage green. Look lovely in here, Mr Bloxham. I like a green."" Some time later, Bloxham is accosted by Mrs Glanville, wife of a man who was thrown in prison for debts after the collapse of Bloxham's scheme. ""My husband, sir, blew his brains out last evening."" ""What?"" ""He procured a pistol. How I know not. Then he wrote me a short farewell. And then he took his own life."" ""My deepest sympathies, madam."" ""My own dear Harry.

This shift, observed during the recent menswear season, signals a strategic realignment in how brands build hype and control their narrative. On June 24, Pharrell Williams, the creative director of Louis Vuitton Men's, personally messaged Albert Ayal, a talent scout for the fashion Instagram account @UpNextDesigner, with early details of the collection. “Hey — wanted you to be the first to see details of the collection from tonight's LV Men's show. Sending some pics soon,” the message read, originating from the @Skateboard Instagram account, Louis Vuitton's platform for behind-the-scenes content. Ayal promptly shared a screenshot of the direct message to his Instagram story. The Rise of the DM Reveal Ayal's experience wasn't isolated. Bally extended a similar courtesy to Scott Staniland, a sustainable fashion creator and consultant, sending him a photograph from the brand's Milan presentation, which Staniland then shared with his followers. Maison Margiela took a slightly different approach, directly inviting fashion critic Ashantéa Austin to its couture show via direct message, a moment Austin documented and shared as a reel. Perhaps the most proactive strategy came from Dior. In anticipation of Jonathan Anderson's menswear debut, the brand added content creator and fashion critic Hanan Besovic (@IDeserveCouture) to its Instagram “Close Friends” list. This granted Besovic exclusive access to sneak peeks of Anderson's mood boards and handbag designs, content she subsequently shared on both TikTok and Instagram. A New Era of Brand-Influencer Dynamics This trend represents a significant departure from traditional public relations practices. By directly engaging with key influencers, luxury brands are attempting to cultivate a more authentic and immediate connection with their target audiences. The practice also allows for greater control over messaging, as brands can share information directly, unfiltered by journalistic interpretation. The willingness of creators to publicly share these direct messages – screenshots and reels – further amplifies the brand's reach, effectively turning the initial outreach into additional marketing content. This symbiotic relationship highlights the growing power of social media marketing within the luxury sector and the increasing value placed on the curated perspectives of online tastemakers. The move towards direct engagement suggests a broader industry recognition that traditional media cycles are no longer sufficient to generate the desired level of buzz and consumer excitement. Instead, brands are prioritizing speed, exclusivity, and the perceived authenticity of influencer endorsements. This strategy is likely to continue evolving as the digital landscape shifts and new platforms emerge.

mov_0C31A16BA2532CF9CF37DA75CA81F56B,"  Change is afoot as fashion's musical chairs comes to a halt. When it comes to shifts in creative direction, menswear collections and the vision they represent have always served as the tip of the iceberg in signalling where the brand is headed. Often, they reflect a calculated risk or a tamer approach that holds more tightly to the brand's core values, in consideration of their male consumers and a smaller vernacular of silhouettes to play with. As Men's Fashion Week comes to an end, Men's Folio dissects the Top 5 trends for Spring/Summer 2026. FIT FLOP Where we come from, there has always been a slightly negative connotation when it comes to pairing open-toed footwear with trousers — anything but shorts, really. Can Spring/Summer 2026 usher in a shift in the perception commonly associated with a lack of sartorial care when one dons their slides or sandals with denim or chinos? As demonstrated by Hermes, Yohji Yamamoto and Dolce & Gabbana, what makes their trouser and chancla pairing feel like the epitome of casual summer dressing comes down to the fluidity of the trousers. A rigid dress pant may feel out of place, but lightweight materials that flow create a congruent impression when worn with sandals. This explains why the Dolce's “business on top, slumber party at the bottom” ensemble looks harmonious. DRAMATIC SUITING Suits in the summer should be anything but stuffy — across their construction, materials and finishes. The Power Suit takes on a slightly different connotation at Louis Gabriel Nouchi's Spring/Summer 26 collection, as he explores the notion of power through the lens of sexuality. Eroticism does not mean being unclothed, as Nouchi presents relaxed double-breasted suits styled with latex ties. Silhouettes portraying dramatic shoulders and a nipped-in waist take place, inspired by the Zoot Suit, are seen across EgonLab and Wooyoungmi, perhaps as a trickle-down effect from the last Met Gala that showcased facets of black dandyism.

When it comes to shifts in creative direction, menswear collections and the vision they represent have always served as the tip of the iceberg in signalling where the brand is headed. Often, they reflect a calculated risk or a tamer approach that holds more tightly to the brand's core values, in consideration of their male consumers and a smaller vernacular of silhouettes to play with. As Men's Fashion Week comes to an end, Men's Folio dissects the Top 5 trends for Spring/Summer 2026. FIT FLOP Where we come from, there has always been a slightly negative connotation when it comes to pairing open-toed footwear with trousers — anything but shorts, really. Can Spring/Summer 2026 usher in a shift in the perception commonly associated with a lack of sartorial care when one dons their slides or sandals with denim or chinos? As demonstrated by Hermes, Yohji Yamamoto and Dolce & Gabbana, what makes their trouser and chancla pairing feel like the epitome of casual summer dressing comes down to the fluidity of the trousers. A rigid dress pant may feel out of place, but lightweight materials that flow create a congruent impression when worn with sandals. This explains why the Dolce's “business on top, slumber party at the bottom” ensemble looks harmonious. DRAMATIC SUITING Suits in the summer should be anything but stuffy — across their construction, materials and finishes. The Power Suit takes on a slightly different connotation at Louis Gabriel Nouchi's Spring/Summer 26 collection, as he explores the notion of power through the lens of sexuality. Eroticism does not mean being unclothed, as Nouchi presents relaxed double-breasted suits styled with latex ties. Silhouettes portraying dramatic shoulders and a nipped-in waist take place, inspired by the Zoot Suit, are seen across EgonLab and Wooyoungmi, perhaps as a trickle-down effect from the last Met Gala that showcased facets of black dandyism. The most direct nod comes from Willy Chavarria during his PFW showcase, where the suit has been used to symbolise the identity and influence of immigrants, referencing his cultural upbringing.

2589BEB9B14AC7175588ED5AAA109DC6,"  A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside -- and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power. Inside, dove-gray velvet lined the walls of a temporary event space and displayed two rare 18th-century oils by Jean Siméon Chardin on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland and the Louvre. Robert Pattinson gossiped with Josh O'Connor. Donatella Versace schmoozed with Roger Federer. A pregnant Rihanna arrived with ASAP Rocky a mere 45 minutes after the official start time. That's how much anticipation there was for the Dior men's show. The filmmaker Luca Guadagnino was even trailing around to document the moment. It was Jonathan Anderson's debut as the creative director/savior of the house, the first designer to be put in charge of both men's and women's wear. And under all the buzz, a giant question mark hovered: Could the former Loewe wunderkind reignite excitement not just in the brand but in fashion? Mr. Anderson made it look easy. Literally. Beginning with his take on the Bar jacket, the most famous Dior women's wear shape -- the one that prompted the Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow to jump out of her seat shrieking, ''It's a New Look!'' in 1947. It was reimagined in a Donegal tweed with a flat back and a whiff of the hourglass at the front, as if it retained a vague memory of what it once was. With it, he paired not a shirt but a stiff white stock collar and a pair of oversize white cotton cargo shorts, each side sporting elaborate folds to create the plumped out silhouette of a goose, or a 1948 couture dress called the Delft. Go on, shake your tail feathers. If little Lord Fauntleroy had spent a year at U.S.C. and then returned for a pickup game of basketball at Versailles, this is how he might dress. It was not a capital N New Look. It wasn't that radical, or shocking. But it was an awfully charming newish one. And it was situated smack in the middle of the tension between formality and informality, men's wear and women's wear, commerce and creativity (Mr. Anderson's own work at Loewe and Uniqlo and what he inherited at Dior), which seems to define this particular moment. No one is all one thing or another. Neither are their clothes. Neither are the totems of wealth. What Mr. Anderson proposed was a clear and convincing argument that contradictions can gracefully coexist. Most of all, he put forward the belief that fashion and wearability are not irreconcilable ideas -- that you either have to look bizarro or look boring. For every highfalutin garment there was an equal and opposite this-old-thing, usually worn together. Velvet frock coats were paired with faded jeans in Japanese denim. Olive green puffer coats and down vests were cut with trapeze backs. The exact pattern of another classic Dior dress, the Caprice, with its elaborately swathed peplum skirt, was applied to a pair of loose khakis, giving one leg the fillip of a drape. An 18th-century frock coat was exactingly reproduced -- in moleskin. There were shamrocks on tennis shoes and high-tops with driving shoe soles; cable knits under elaborate waist coats. There was a lot of neck action. Book totes borrowed, again, from the women's line, with actual book titles on them from Baudelaire and Françoise Sagan. Mr. Anderson had clearly done his homework. Easter eggs to early Dior were everywhere. Even the labels inside the clothes were in the designer's preferred silk faille. He was never going to toss everything out the window and start again. He couldn't. Dior is a multibillion-dollar business, after all, and some of his predecessors (Raf Simons, Hedi Slimane, John Galliano) were his idols. Once upon a time, a designer might have had the arrogance to wipe the slate clean, but this is a new age. The industry is in crisis, and the creative tectonic plates are shifting. It is why Mr. Anderson invited seemingly every other designer in Paris to join him at the show. It is also why he picked the Chardin oils and why he seeded his Instagram with Warhol Polaroids of Lee Radziwill and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Chardin, he said in a preview, ''kind of loosened up the still life''; Warhol made pop culture high art. Both crystallized an inflection point in culture. Mr. Anderson clearly wants his Dior to do the same. His show invitation came borne on a china plate with three china eggs on top, as if a reminder that the men's wear was just the beginning (and maybe to acknowledge that some shells may get broken along the way). Fair enough. The result may not knock you sideways, but it's likely to make you sit up and buy....","A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside -- and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power.

644585D332B4330B4F22FA250AE5663D,"  And what's in it for the brands? As the industry's model for working with public figures shifts, the power dynamics are becoming increasingly unclear. On Friday in Paris, the Northern Irish designer Jonathan Anderson will show his first collection as the creative director of the French fashion house Dior. During his previous, 11-year tenure as the creative director of the Spanish brand Loewe, Anderson became known for his avant-garde sensibility and dedication to craft -- but also for his unique ability to turn the internet's so-called boyfriends (those young actors and musicians who are lusted over online with possessive familiarity) into bona fide celebrities. In the front row of Anderson's fall 2024 Loewe men's wear show in Paris were the established actors Jamie Dornan, Andrew Garfield and Nicholas Hoult, but also, seated with equal prominence, emerging ones, including Drew Starkey, who was set to star in ''Queer'' (the 2024 Luca Guadagnino movie for which Anderson oversaw the costumes), and Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist, who would soon appear as romantic leads in Guadagnino's film ''Challengers,'' a film that helped them reach mainstream heartthrob status, and with which Anderson was also involved as a costume designer. The following June, at Anderson's final Loewe men's runway show, the rising actors Kit Connor, Evan Peters and Enzo Vogrincic sat front row -- suggesting, based on the strength of the designer's track record, that they too would also soon become leading men. For Loewe, it was a display of cultural currency; for the actors, it was free publicity. It used to be that an association with a brand was, if not a career-killer, then certainly not chic for an actor. It was hard to be taken seriously as both an artist and a de facto fashion model. But in recent decades, the rise of social media and the expansion of the fashion industry have blurred the lines between model, actor and influencer. Back in the 1980s, the Italian fashion house Armani began dressing Hollywood celebrities, including, most notably, Richard Gere for his role in the 1980 movie ''American Gigolo.'' But gone are the days when one megastar served as a company's global face. Today brands adopt a multitiered system of ambassadors that includes international stars, yes, but also up-and-comers and influencers. While these cliques are often described by their members and parent brands as ''family,'' and frequently represent a genuine affinity, they are also carefully constructed to maximize a company's exposure on red carpets and billboards -- but also very specific corners of TikTok. Now, as this business decision solidifies into standard practice, the question is, Who ultimately wields the power, the celebrities or the brands? Until 2010, ''a few brands had ambassadors, but it was mainly for fragrance,'' says Ben Cercio, the founder of a consulting agency specializing in brand strategy and communications with clients including the French fashion house Givenchy. But with the launch of Instagram that year, a shift occurred: companies began to engage not just with major actors but also with ''microinfluencers'' -- online personalities with less than 100,000 followers -- to reach their audiences early on. And because social media has accelerated the rise to fame, whenever a new talent in any field emerges from the crowd, ''every brand wants to get its hands on them,'' says Cercio. Now an ingénue like the actress Mikey Madison, who starred in last year's ''Anora,'' might have a dozen offers from brands immediately after making a buzzy debut at a festival like Cannes, suggesting that it's often the young actors, rather than the brands, who are in control. When Madison accepted her Oscar for best lead actress in March, she wore a custom look from Dior. Cercio adds that while relationships once developed organically -- a talent would come to a fashion show, be given some pieces and maybe wear something from the latest collection on the red carpet -- increasingly, ''money is very quickly involved.'' Indeed, an ambassadorship is now a coveted deal among celebrities of all tiers. '' There's enough proof in the market of just how great a partnership can look,'' says George Georgopoulos, the director of brand partnerships at Huxley, an agency that represents artists including Charli XCX. After releasing her globally successful album ''Brat,'' last summer, the pop star partnered with companies from H&M to Acne Studios and performed with a seemingly empty Gucci bag on ''Saturday Night Live'' in what appeared to be a wink-wink placement. (She'd headlined the brand's annual LACMA Gala a few weeks before.) Getting a check for simply holding an object, she seemed to imply, was not selling out but making the system work for her. For many celebrities, ''there's more money in the ambassadorship than in a lot of the payments they receive for their work onscreen,'' says the writer and pop culture podcaster Evan Ross Katz. Those funds can free up major actors to pursue less commercial projects, like indie films and plays; they are also increasingly essential for younger performers who aren't yet earning large sums for their creative work. Depending on their level of fame, a celebrity can make anywhere from $50,000 to many millions of dollars with endorsement deals, according to several people who work on confidential contracts. On the lower end are social media posts: An artist with a significant following could be paid $100,000 to $150,000 for a single main-grid post holding a product and tagging a brand. If their following is in the multiple millions, however, these numbers can reach seven figures, one stylist said. Slightly more lucrative are red-carpet appearances. And on the higher end are elaborate contracts that require more than just showing up at Fashion Week twice a year. A deal worth around $3 million, for example, could involve appearing in advertising campaigns, attending events like store openings, being dressed for the red carpet, wearing the brand out more casually for paparazzi shots and creating several social media posts. The prestige of an endorsement deal can also boost the cachet of a relatively unknown artist or internet personality immeasurably. Katz cites the YouTuber Emma Chamberlain and the pop star Addison Rae as two recent examples of social media stars whose fame has grown well beyond their original audience, partly because of their fashion partnerships. Since 2019, Chamberlain has been an ambassador for Louis Vuitton; last year, Rae appeared in a campaign film for Saint Laurent. Likewise, while celebrity ambassadors might not necessarily move units for brands in the short term -- unless they have the influence of a Kardashian or a Hadid -- they give companies exposure to niche but devoted audiences. By putting the actor Jeremy Allen White on a billboard, for example, Calvin Klein helped transform a nascent sex symbol into the kind of established idol the brand more typically casts -- and it got to be a part of the cultural conversation following the success of White's show ''The Bear.'' And when, last summer, Marc Jacobs recruited the viral TikTok chef Nara Smith to ''make'' one of the brand's tote bags from baking ingredients in a tongue-in-cheek video, Smith gained fashion credibility, while the brand got to create a social media moment of its own. Both parties signaled that they were in on the joke. But not all relationships are the right match. '' I remember this desire for fashion to lead the conversation and not follow it,'' says Katz.

Y para lograrlo sin 17 productos ni gastar una fortuna, entra en escena Rimmel London Sculpting Palette, una joya low cost con tres tonos que trabajan en sinergia: bronceador, iluminador y colorete, todo en un compacto que cabe en cualquier bolso y cuesta apenas 6 euros. ¿Lo mejor? No es una paleta cualquiera. Fue desarrollada junto a Kate Moss, quien aporta ese toque cool británico a una fórmula práctica y efectiva. La promesa de la paleta es clara: esculpir, iluminar y dar color al rostro con naturalidad. Pero en la práctica, también ofrece versatilidad total: El bronceador es de tono neutro, sin subtono naranja, ideal para contorno sutil o efecto sunkissed. El iluminador tiene destello fino, nada glitter, que aporta ese glow elegante estilo Hailey Bieber. El rubor es rosa-melocotón universal, favorecedor en todo tipo de pieles, que da ese toque de vitalidad instantánea. Además, su textura sedosa y modulable permite trabajar las capas sin dejar manchones ni exceso de polvo. Se difumina fácil con brocha, esponja o incluso con los dedos si estás fuera de casa. Rimmel no es nuevo en el juego, pero esta paleta lleva meses en los primeros puestos de ventas de Amazon y es protagonista de muchos tutoriales en TikTok y YouTube. ¿La razón? Hace el trabajo de tres productos de lujo en un solo gesto. Muchas influencers la comparan con: La Filmstar Bronze & Glow de Charlotte Tilbury (pero 40 euros más barata). El Dior Backstage Glow Face Palette, por su efecto de segunda piel. O incluso con Fenty Beauty, en cuanto a practicidad y pigmentación. Además, en un contexto donde buscamos optimizar rutinas y espacio (bye neceser gigante), una paleta todo en uno tiene un valor emocional: es eficiente, compacta y libre de complicaciones. Por 6 euros, la Rimmel Sculpting Palette ofrece calidad, practicidad y versatilidad. Perfecta para principiantes, minimalistas, chicas que viajan o quienes buscan un glow con poco esfuerzo. No sustituye a productos de gama alta en textura extrema o larga duración tipo red carpet, pero para el día a día y looks de oficina o citas, es más que suficiente. Además, es un recordatorio de que el buen maquillaje no tiene por qué costar una fortuna. Porque al final, el estilo es lo que haces con lo que tienes, no lo que cuesta. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]La tendencia de “maquillaje sin maquillaje” sigue fuerte, pero con un giro: ahora no solo queremos lucir frescas, también estructuradas.

Olivia Palamountain reports Venice's Hotel Cipriani has launched an exclusive Dior bar as part of its 2025 season reopening, marking a new collaboration between the legendary hospitality brand and the French luxury fashion house. Il Bacaro Dior (open Tuesday to Sunday from 6.30pm to 11.30pm) takes in glorious views over St. Mark's basin and features rattan furniture offset by cushions upholstered in green toile de Jouy - a heritage printed cloth produced by Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf in the 18th century. To amplify the branded experience, guests can take archipelago excursions on boats bearing the Dior signature. Located moments from St Mark's Square via the hotel's private boat service, Hotel Cipriani sits on the tip of the island with panoramic views across the Venetian lagoon. The property, which became Belmond's first acquisition in 1976, features Venice's largest private swimming pool, the over-water Cip's Club restaurant and the Casanova wellness centre. Alongside the bar, the luxury fashion house has installed a Dioriviera boutique, selling a collection of branded resortwear. The boutique features art installations including a large bamboo mural by Korakot and a glass sculpture by Simone Crestani, alongside hand-made furniture by Italian manufacturer Bonacina. Also new for 2025 are a series of renovations by architect and interior designer Peter Marino, who has overseen the refined redesign of 13 rooms including two master suites designed as Venetian apartments. Marino's multi-phase renovation includes two master suites featuring dining rooms, libraries and salons with lagoon views, plus 11 suites and junior suites with private balconies overlooking the Casanova Gardens. The architect has maintained the beloved lobby whilst creating an adjacent double-height arrival experience. New lagoon experiences for the summer season include sunset tours and enhanced dining at the Michelin-starred Oro restaurant, led by Chef Yana Ghedini in collaboration with world-renowned chef Massimo Bottura. The Il Bacaro Dior bar and Dioriviera boutique represent the latest luxury brand partnership for the Belmond property, which has operated on Giudecca Island since 1958.

mov_594F3EE4E0F1DE7995F483BA3CE9106F,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Berlin. US-Rapper Diddy hat ein mildes Urteil erhalten. Seine Kinder zeigen sich erleichtert. Dabei ist ihr Familienleben von Krisen geprägt. Während Sean Combs nach dem Urteil betend auf die Knie ging und sich bei den Geschworenen bedankte, tobten Unterstützerinnen der MeToo-Bewegung vor Wut. „Diese Entscheidung macht mich sauer“, schrieb die Schauspielerin Rosie O'Donnell bei Instagram. In nur zwei von fünf Anklagepunkten sprachen die Geschworenen den früheren Rap-Superstar vor Gericht in New York schuldig – und das waren die schwächsten Anschuldigungen in Zusammenhang mit Prostitution. Die Vorwürfe der Verschwörung zur organisierten Kriminalität und des Menschenhandels wies die Jury zurück. Das Strafmaß soll wie üblich zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt bekannt gegeben werden. Offenbar ist der 3. Oktober dafür anvisiert. Lesen Sie auch: US-Rapper Sean „P. Diddy“ Combs teilweise schuldig gesprochen „I'm coming home, baby! “ (dt. „Ich komme nach Hause, Baby! “) – mit diesen Worten wandte sich der 55-Jährige laut US-Medien nach der Urteilsverkündung an seine Angehörigen im Gerichtssaal. Die Familie zeigte sich erleichtert und feierte die Entscheidung der Jury. Sowohl Diddys Mutter als auch seine Kinder verließen das Gericht mit lächelnden Gesichtern. „Wir sind so glücklich, mein Pops kommt nach Hause – Gott sei Dank! “, wird einer seiner Söhne zitiert. Combs hat sechs leibliche Kinder und ein Stiefkind mit vier verschiedenen Müttern. Auf Instagram stellen sie sich immer wieder hinter ihren berühmten Vater. Und das, obwohl ihre Familiengeschichte keine leichte ist. Nach Diddy-Verhaftung: Kinder stellten sich hinter ihren Vater Die jüngsten Ereignisse hätten ihre Familie am Boden zerstört zurückgelassen, schrieben sechs von Combs' Kindern nach seiner Verhaftung im September 2024 auf Instagram: Ihr Vater werde „auf der Grundlage von Anschuldigungen, Verschwörungstheorien und falschen Narrativen“ verurteilt, hieß es in dem gemeinsamen Post von Quincy Brown (33), Justin (30), Christian (26), Chance (18) und den Zwillingen Jessie und D'Lila Combs (17). „Wir halten an der Wahrheit fest, weil wir wissen, dass sie siegen wird und nichts die Stärke unserer Familie brechen wird“, so die Kinder weiter. Ihr Statement beendeten sie mit den Worten: „Wir vermissen und lieben dich, Dad. “ In einem weiteren Post gratulierten sie ihm außerdem zum Geburtstag (4. November), den Combs letztes Jahr im Gefängnis verbringen musste. Sean „Diddy“ Combs: Die Mutter seiner vier Kinder starb tragisch Es ist nicht das erste Mal, dass die Geschwister eine schwere Zeit durchmachen müssen. Die Familiengeschichte ist durchaus dramatisch: Drei seiner sieben Kinder bekam Combs mit dem amerikanischen Model Kim Porter (1970–2018). Wie unter anderem CNN berichtet, soll das Paar von 1994 bis 2007 eine On-off-Beziehung geführt haben. In dieser Zeit wurden Christian und die Zwillinge Jessie und D'Lila geboren.

In nur zwei von fünf Anklagepunkten sprachen die Geschworenen den früheren Rap-Superstar vor Gericht in New York schuldig – und das waren die schwächsten Anschuldigungen in Zusammenhang mit Prostitution. Die Vorwürfe der Verschwörung zur organisierten Kriminalität und des Menschenhandels wies die Jury zurück. Das Strafmaß soll wie üblich zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt bekannt gegeben werden. Offenbar ist der 3. Oktober dafür anvisiert. Lesen Sie auch: US-Rapper Sean „P. Diddy“ Combs teilweise schuldig gesprochen „I'm coming home, baby! “ (dt. „Ich komme nach Hause, Baby! “) – mit diesen Worten wandte sich der 55-Jährige laut US-Medien nach der Urteilsverkündung an seine Angehörigen im Gerichtssaal. Die Familie zeigte sich erleichtert und feierte die Entscheidung der Jury. Sowohl Diddys Mutter als auch seine Kinder verließen das Gericht mit lächelnden Gesichtern. „Wir sind so glücklich, mein Pops kommt nach Hause – Gott sei Dank! “, wird einer seiner Söhne zitiert. Combs hat sechs leibliche Kinder und ein Stiefkind mit vier verschiedenen Müttern. Auf Instagram stellen sie sich immer wieder hinter ihren berühmten Vater. Und das, obwohl ihre Familiengeschichte keine leichte ist. Die jüngsten Ereignisse hätten ihre Familie am Boden zerstört zurückgelassen, schrieben sechs von Combs' Kindern nach seiner Verhaftung im September 2024 auf Instagram: Ihr Vater werde „auf der Grundlage von Anschuldigungen, Verschwörungstheorien und falschen Narrativen“ verurteilt, hieß es in dem gemeinsamen Post von Quincy Brown (33), Justin (30), Christian (26), Chance (18) und den Zwillingen Jessie und D'Lila Combs (17). „Wir halten an der Wahrheit fest, weil wir wissen, dass sie siegen wird und nichts die Stärke unserer Familie brechen wird“, so die Kinder weiter. Ihr Statement beendeten sie mit den Worten: „Wir vermissen und lieben dich, Dad. “ In einem weiteren Post gratulierten sie ihm außerdem zum Geburtstag (4. November), den Combs letztes Jahr im Gefängnis verbringen musste. Es ist nicht das erste Mal, dass die Geschwister eine schwere Zeit durchmachen müssen. Die Familiengeschichte ist durchaus dramatisch: Drei seiner sieben Kinder bekam Combs mit dem amerikanischen Model Kim Porter (1970–2018). Wie unter anderem CNN berichtet, soll das Paar von 1994 bis 2007 eine On-off-Beziehung geführt haben. In dieser Zeit wurden Christian und die Zwillinge Jessie und D'Lila geboren. Auch Porters ältesten Sohn, Quincy Brown, hat Combs mit aufgezogen. Er stammt aus ihrer früheren Verbindung mit dem US-Sänger Al B. Sure! . Doch die Kinder der beiden müssen heute ohne ihre Mutter ihren Weg finden: Porter starb im November 2018 mit 47 Jahren plötzlich an den Folgen einer Lungenentzündung. Porters Sohn Quincy konnte mit der Hilfe seines berühmten Stiefvaters seinen großen Leidenschaften, der Schauspielerei und der Musik, nachgehen, wie er 2021 im Interview mit „People“ berichtete. Er sei zwischen Georgia und New York aufgewachsen – schon in ihrer Kindheit hätten er und seine Geschwister Combs auf Tour begleitet.

Über mehr als dreimal so viele Follower freut sich ihr Bruder Christian. Der 26–Jährige ist als Model und Rapper aktiv und betitelt sich selbst auf Instagram als „kingcombs“. Nicht nur die Musikrichtung hat er mit seinem berühmten Vater gemein: Wie unter anderem die „FAZ“ berichtet, wurden auch gegen ihn Missbrauchsvorwürfe laut. Ende 2022 soll er auf einer Yacht, die sein Vater gechartert hatte, unter anderem versucht haben, eine Kellnerin zum Oralsex zu zwingen und ihr mit Betäubungsmitteln versetzten Tequila einzuflößen. Der Vorwurf war rund eine Woche nach einer Razzia in Sean Combs' Villa in Los Angeles aufgekommen, bei der auch Combs' Söhne Christian und Justin Dior in Handschellen gelegt worden waren. Laut der Nachrichtenagentur AP stand die Durchsuchung im Zusammenhang mit dem Vorwurf des Sexhandels gegen Combs. Die Razzia sei im Rahmen von Strafverfolgungsmaßnahmen nötig gewesen, teilte das zuständigen Heimatschutzministerium mit. Die Mutter von Justin Dior Combs, Modedesignerin und Stylistin Misa Hylton, warf den Polizisten hinterher vor, ihren Sohn und dessen Halbbruder terrorisiert zu haben. Dies war nicht das erste Mal, dass auch Justin Dior mit dem Gesetz in Konflikt geriet. Amerikanischen Medienberichten zufolge wurde er im Juni 2023 wegen Trunkenheit am Steuer angeklagt und im Herbst desselben Jahres zu drei Jahren auf Bewährung verurteilt. Der 30-Jährige hatte Soziologie an der University of California in Los Angeles studiert, bevor er sich als Schauspieler versuchte. Seit seiner Verhaftung wurde es jedoch in den sozialen Netzwerken eher still um ihn. Über Combs' jüngste Tochter Chance ist zwar noch nichts dergleichen zu lesen, aber ihr Geburtsdatum ist brisant: Die heute 18-Jährige wurde nur fünf Monate vor seinen Zwillingen geboren – allerdings nicht von Kim Porter, sondern von Sarah Chapman. Die Unternehmerin soll laut Medienberichten auch der Grund sein, warum Combs' On-off-Beziehung mit Porter endgültig in die Brüche ging.

We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Once again, at this year's Wimbledon tournament, the only thing distracting from the tennis is the court-side style. “Wimbledon has turned the stands into a catwalk, and I am here for it,” says model and presenter Leomie Anderson, who is covering Wimbledon as Clearpay's fashion expert this season. If recent years saw guests erring on the side of safe – quiet luxury defined by demure dresses, boxy blazers and the occasional fascinator – 2025 has shifted gear. “There's a real shift happening,” Anderson explains, “people used to play it safe with blazers, midi dresses, the usual suspects. But this year, the crowd is serving. It's like everyone got the memo that Wimbledon is just as much a style moment as it is a sport.” And the stats back her up. Broderie anglaise is booming – with maxi dresses up 147%, skirts up 33% – hats are having a high-fashion renaissance with floppy styles up 99%, and butter-yellow is surging according to Clearpay. The best celebrity looks managed to balance their personality with a playful nod to the tournament's stereotypes – from Wimbledon whites to strawberries and cream. “There's something powerful about its simplicity, the traditions – the setting, the subtlety,” says Anderson. “People know they have to bring their A-game.” Here are some of the best-dressed celebrities at the tournament so far and how they aced Wimbledon style. Olivia Rodrigo A masterstroke in edging up tradition, singer Olivia Rodrigo, 22, wore a red gingham shirt dress by Ralph Lauren from the spring/summer 2000 archive – a playful nod to Wimbledon's iconic strawberries and cream. Her boyfriend, Louis Partridge, 22, coordinated in a red striped tie and navy blazer. Following her headlining performance at Glastonbury Festival on Sunday, Rodrigo managed to nail the elusive balance of British heritage and Gen Z irreverence. Anna and Michael Murray Also sticking to Wimble classics was retail tycoon and CEO of Frasers Group, Michael Murray, who went traditional in a linen white suit, a cream Panama and brown suede loafers. His wife Anna wore the print of the season in a tulle black and white polka dot midi dress, with black suede pumps and black leather Birkin. Cate Blanchett Actress Cate Blanchett, 56, stood out on Centre Court in a pearlescent Prince of Wales check suit by Giorgio Armani. Sharply tailored but soft in palette, it was a classic Blanchett power move, turning heads without the noise. “Cate's baby blue tartan suit was effortless and elegant,” Anderson puts it, “that classic tailoring is signature Cate cool.” Leslie Mann Wimbledon whites are a fail-safe style to sport year after year. While they run the risk of becoming repetitive and – dare I say – boring; when styled right with interesting cuts, whites can be as elegant as ever. Actress Leslie Mann, 53, appeared on day three in an ivory Dior bar jacket and delicate lace skirt. The look was reminiscent of the Princess of Wales recent Self Portrait ensemble at the Order of the Garter in June. David Beckham One thing more certain than spotting a cream Panama hat in the Wimbledon stands is spotting David Beckham. The 50-year-old former footballer once again brought off-court elegance in a cream silk-linen suit from his own Boss collaboration, finished with a chocolate brown tie. The only fashion blunder was plaster cast on his right arm – though even that couldn't detract from his summer suiting credentials. Dominic Cooper Unlike Beckham, 47 year-old actor Dominic Cooper opted out of the classic Wimbledon look and sported a bright powder blue suit with matching trainers. “I'm seeing bold colour choices […] and people leaning into what makes their style unique,” says Anderson of the look. Cooper reminded us that co-ordination doesn't have to mean stiff – and tonal can be a statement when done right. Tom Daley Dusky teal was Olympic diver Tom Daley's shade of choice – cool and contemporary and a refreshing break from Wimbledon white. Daley, 31, paired the Paul Smith suit with a Christian Louboutin clutch and a Chopard watch. Judy Murray Mother to former Wimbledon champion Sir Andy Murray, Judy Murray chose a sunshine-yellow Me+Em dress with white platform trainers. The cheerful dress was bang on trend, with butter yellow emerging as the summer's sleeper hit....","Your support helps us to tell the story From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

If recent years saw guests erring on the side of safe – quiet luxury defined by demure dresses, boxy blazers and the occasional fascinator – 2025 has shifted gear. “There's a real shift happening,” Anderson explains, “people used to play it safe with blazers, midi dresses, the usual suspects. But this year, the crowd is serving. It's like everyone got the memo that Wimbledon is just as much a style moment as it is a sport.” And the stats back her up. Broderie anglaise is booming – with maxi dresses up 147%, skirts up 33% – hats are having a high-fashion renaissance with floppy styles up 99%, and butter-yellow is surging according to Clearpay. The best celebrity looks managed to balance their personality with a playful nod to the tournament's stereotypes – from Wimbledon whites to strawberries and cream. “There's something powerful about its simplicity, the traditions – the setting, the subtlety,” says Anderson. “People know they have to bring their A-game.” Here are some of the best-dressed celebrities at the tournament so far and how they aced Wimbledon style. Olivia Rodrigo A masterstroke in edging up tradition, singer Olivia Rodrigo, 22, wore a red gingham shirt dress by Ralph Lauren from the spring/summer 2000 archive – a playful nod to Wimbledon's iconic strawberries and cream. Her boyfriend, Louis Partridge, 22, coordinated in a red striped tie and navy blazer. Following her headlining performance at Glastonbury Festival on Sunday, Rodrigo managed to nail the elusive balance of British heritage and Gen Z irreverence. Anna and Michael Murray Also sticking to Wimble classics was retail tycoon and CEO of Frasers Group, Michael Murray, who went traditional in a linen white suit, a cream Panama and brown suede loafers. His wife Anna wore the print of the season in a tulle black and white polka dot midi dress, with black suede pumps and black leather Birkin. Cate Blanchett Actress Cate Blanchett, 56, stood out on Centre Court in a pearlescent Prince of Wales check suit by Giorgio Armani. Sharply tailored but soft in palette, it was a classic Blanchett power move, turning heads without the noise. “Cate's baby blue tartan suit was effortless and elegant,” Anderson puts it, “that classic tailoring is signature Cate cool.” Leslie Mann Wimbledon whites are a fail-safe style to sport year after year. While they run the risk of becoming repetitive and – dare I say – boring; when styled right with interesting cuts, whites can be as elegant as ever. Actress Leslie Mann, 53, appeared on day three in an ivory Dior bar jacket and delicate lace skirt. The look was reminiscent of the Princess of Wales recent Self Portrait ensemble at the Order of the Garter in June. David Beckham One thing more certain than spotting a cream Panama hat in the Wimbledon stands is spotting David Beckham. The 50-year-old former footballer once again brought off-court elegance in a cream silk-linen suit from his own Boss collaboration, finished with a chocolate brown tie. The only fashion blunder was plaster cast on his right arm – though even that couldn't detract from his summer suiting credentials. Dominic Cooper Unlike Beckham, 47 year-old actor Dominic Cooper opted out of the classic Wimbledon look and sported a bright powder blue suit with matching trainers. “I'm seeing bold colour choices […] and people leaning into what makes their style unique,” says Anderson of the look. Cooper reminded us that co-ordination doesn't have to mean stiff – and tonal can be a statement when done right. Tom Daley Dusky teal was Olympic diver Tom Daley's shade of choice – cool and contemporary and a refreshing break from Wimbledon white. Daley, 31, paired the Paul Smith suit with a Christian Louboutin clutch and a Chopard watch. Judy Murray Mother to former Wimbledon champion Sir Andy Murray, Judy Murray chose a sunshine-yellow Me+Em dress with white platform trainers.

The annual tournament, long associated with understated elegance, appears to have transformed its spectator areas into an unexpected runway. ""Wimbledon has turned the stands into a catwalk, and I am here for it,"" declares model and presenter Leomie Anderson, who is covering the event as Clearpay's fashion expert this season. Her observation highlights a significant shift from recent years, which saw guests largely adhering to a ""quiet luxury"" aesthetic defined by demure dresses, boxy blazers, and the occasional fascinator. “There's a real shift happening,” Anderson says. “People used to play it safe with blazers, midi dresses, the usual suspects. But this year, the crowd is serving. It's like everyone got the memo that Wimbledon is just as much a style moment as it is a sport.” This sartorial revolution is backed by compelling data from Clearpay. Broderie anglaise, a delicate embroidered fabric, is experiencing a significant boom, with maxi dresses in the style seeing a 147 per cent increase and skirts up by 33 per cent. Hats are also enjoying a high-fashion renaissance, with floppy styles surging by 99 per cent. Adding a splash of colour to the courtside scene, butter-yellow has emerged as a dominant trend, according to the payment platform. The best celebrity looks managed to balance the wearer's personality with a playful nod to the tournament's stereotypes – from Wimbledon whites to strawberries and cream. “There's something powerful about its simplicity, the traditions – the setting, the subtlety,” says Anderson. “People know they have to bring their A-game.” Here are some of the best-dressed celebrities at the tournament so far and how they aced Wimbledon style.

From the very first day, we were immersed in a culture of excellence. We were encouraged by industry leaders and inspiring speakers to think boldly, communicate with purpose, and push the boundaries of what we believed possible. Throughout the program, I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects with some of the most influential names in the industry. We developed a 360° strategy for L'Oréal  La Roche-Posay Laboratoire Dermatologique, created a new fragrance concept for Parfums Christian Dior, reimagined Veepee's approach to Gen Z, crafted a sustainability narrative for Amazon  in collaboration with DDB  and tackled a strategic consulting case with McKinsey & Company, among others. We also attended thought-provoking conferences, including a particularly memorable session with Marc Chaya, CEO and Co-founder of Maison Francis Kurkdjian, which left a lasting impression on me. Beyond the projects and events, I explored new fields, refined critical skills, and experienced meaningful personal and professional growth. This was made possible thanks to the dedication of our professors and the collaboration of brilliant classmates who made the experience truly exceptional. I am especially grateful to our Program Director, Gachoucha Kretz, PhD, and Program Manager, Marion BOUYOU, whose leadership and support shaped the quality of this journey. Their clear vision, thoughtful mentorship, and ongoing encouragement provided the structure and motivation that will continue to guide me well beyond HEC.

mov_0AE0CD3CA2DCF34CA5018FF6B22A4B2E,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Abbey Clancy's daughter Sophia showed she has taken after her model mother as she joined her famous family and footballer father Peter Crouch at the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club for day four of Wimbledon on Thursday. The daughter to the famous couple, 14, showed off her resemblance to her mother as she was seen topping up her lip gloss in the crowd. She joined Abbey, 39, and Peter, 44, who looked happier than ever and packed on the PDA with a kiss while sat in Centre Court, as she stepped out in an all white ensemble. For the outing, Sophie put on a very glamorous display as she toted her belongings around in a black leather Miu Miu bag. It appears that she also has her mother's eye for designer accessories, as she accessorised with four Christian Dior cloth bracelets, each worth a whopping £250. To finish her sporting day outfit, Sophia was seen wearing false eyelashes as she applied a layer of Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip gloss. Meanwhile Abbey - who is also a mother to Liberty, nine, Johnny, seven, and Jack, five - looked incredible for the outing as she wore a yellow striped suit. Liverpool football legend Peter, looked handsome as he attended the event in a casual blue shirt. Abbey has had a highly successful modelling career, while she's also branched out into presenting, novel writing and even won Strictly Come Dancing back in 2013. And Sophia has taken nepotism in her stride as she made her modelling debut aged eight when she joined Abbey for a Lipsy shoot. Sophia has reportedly had 'loads of offers' already from agencies as she is being dubbed the 'next Lila Moss' A source told Heat World: 'Sophia is getting lots of offers from modelling agencies. They see her as the next big thing, thanks to her looking like Abbey and having Pete's height. 'She has already done campaigns with her mum, but now big-name agencies are desperate to sign her and turn her into the next Lila Moss.' Centre Court spectators will be watching Jack Draper compete against 2017 Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic and Dan Evans takes on Novak Djokovic. Draper, the current world No4, takes on 2017 Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic this afternoon as he looks to progress past the second round for the first time at SW19. World number one Jannik Sinner is also back in the spotlight, up against Aleksandar Vukic, whilst Iga Swiatek plays Caty McNally in the other Centre Court match. Judy Murray has opened up on the secrets of the Royal Box at Wimbledon as celebrity guests continue to flood into Wimbledon. While there are 18 Championship grass courts at SW19, all eyes are often on the historic Centre Court, which plays host to the best stars the sport has to offer as they compete for glory. Centre Court boasts nearly 15,000 seats, meaning lucky punters can be seen cheering on their favourites, and are joined by guests in the Royal Box at around lunchtime each day. So far this week, the likes of John Cena, Thomas Tuchel and Olivia Rodrigo have all been present, with all three part of a star-studded line-up in the Box on Wednesday. On Tuesday Judy, renown for her coaching work in the sport and her support for tennis-playing sons Andy and Jamie, made an appearance. Before her trip, she opened up on what it is like in the Royal Box on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with The National Lottery on Virgin Radio UK. 'Royal Boxing should be a verb, shouldn't it?' she said.' It should be a summer verb.' She added: 'Well, you arrive usually around 11.30, so you go upstairs, they have a champagne reception, then you go in for lunch and you could be sitting beside absolutely anybody at lunch. There's no seating plan, it's just as you go into the room. 'It's in the clubhouse of the All England Club, and the first year that I went I took my mum, of course, and we sat with Jack Nicklaus. I sat with a few years ago a lady who was the first female Spitfire pilot. I mean it's just you could be with absolutely anybody and the stories are fascinating. 'It's really tough when the sun comes round because there's no escape. 'It's actually I think worse for the guys because they have to wear a jacket and tie and they're not allowed to take the jacket off unless the royalty in the box takes their jacket off first. That's the protocol.'","Have YOU got a story?

World number one Jannik Sinner is also back in the spotlight, up against Aleksandar Vukic, whilst Iga Swiatek plays Caty McNally in the other Centre Court match. Judy Murray has opened up on the secrets of the Royal Box at Wimbledon as celebrity guests continue to flood into Wimbledon. While there are 18 Championship grass courts at SW19, all eyes are often on the historic Centre Court, which plays host to the best stars the sport has to offer as they compete for glory. Centre Court boasts nearly 15,000 seats, meaning lucky punters can be seen cheering on their favourites, and are joined by guests in the Royal Box at around lunchtime each day. So far this week, the likes of John Cena, Thomas Tuchel and Olivia Rodrigo have all been present, with all three part of a star-studded line-up in the Box on Wednesday.

Before her trip, she opened up on what it is like in the Royal Box on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with The National Lottery on Virgin Radio UK. 'Royal Boxing should be a verb, shouldn't it?' she said.' It should be a summer verb.' She added: 'Well, you arrive usually around 11.30, so you go upstairs, they have a champagne reception, then you go in for lunch and you could be sitting beside absolutely anybody at lunch. There's no seating plan, it's just as you go into the room. 'It's in the clubhouse of the All England Club, and the first year that I went I took my mum, of course, and we sat with Jack Nicklaus. I sat with a few years ago a lady who was the first female Spitfire pilot. I mean it's just you could be with absolutely anybody and the stories are fascinating. 'It's really tough when the sun comes round because there's no escape. 'It's actually I think worse for the guys because they have to wear a jacket and tie and they're not allowed to take the jacket off unless the royalty in the box takes their jacket off first.

Fendi reintroduced their iconic Spy Bag on Thursday with a cinematic digital campaign starring Amelia Gray, Xiao Wen Ju, and Gabbriette. The 30-second video, photographed and directed by Stevie Dance and styled by Anna Trevelyan, follows the storyline of an underground collector tracking down the coveted accessory. The original Spy Bag was launched by Silvia Venturini Fendi in 2005 and quickly became a defining accessory of the 2000s. The signature design now returns, 20 years after its original release. Spy Bags, both original and new, feature a plush silhouette, twisted handles, and secret compartments that offer privacy in style. The new iteration boasts a few contemporary updates that brings the feeling of Y2K to 2025. Donatella Versace, who announced she would be stepping down from her position as Chief Creative Officer early this spring, launched her final ad campaign this week, starring veteran muses Kate Moss, Kristen McMenamy, Amber Valletta, Natasha Poly, and Claudia Schiffer, as well as newer faces like Anok Yai and Mica Argañaraz. The images and retro video clip feature Donatella's final Fall 2025 collection, and was shot by long-time collaborators Mert & Marcus. Former Miu Miu creative director Dario Vitale will succeed Donatella and stage his debut Versace show in September. The campaign symbolized a passing of the torch to Vitale, honoring the Versace of the past while also celebrating what's to come. “It was all about friendship, loyalty, and love. Every collection is a story, and this campaign is the story of Versace. Inspiring the present and anticipating the future,” Donatella said in a statement. Last week, Zimmermann's Cruise 2026 ready-to-wear Twisted Romance collection hit the streets of Mykonos for a corresponding digital runway show. This adventurous, pirate-inspired collection featured colorful stripes, dramatic corsets, voluminous sleeves, and billowing skirts. The vintage-inspired nautical designs looked at home on the cobblestone alleyways of the island, while the sea breeze showcased the water-like movement of the silk georgette. This isn't the first trip to Mykonos for the Australian brand. Zimmermann opened a boutique there in May and christened it with an exclusive “Dinner at Sea” on June 16. On Tuesday, The National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne announced Westwood | Kawakubo, a major new exhibition featuring over 140 designs by fashion icons Vivienne Westwood and Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons. The exhibit, opening with NGV's annual gala on December 6, marks the first time the work of these two designers will be shown together in a dedicated exhibition. The show will highlight key similarities and differences in the work of the two self-taught designers. Nearly 100 pieces have been drawn from the NGV Collection, alongside loans from major international institutions including the Met, Victoria & Albert Museum, Palais Galliera, and the Vivienne Westwood archive. The exhibition also includes over 40 recent Comme des Garçons works gifted to the NGV for this project. Westwood | Kawakubo continues NGV's history of major fashion exhibitions, following previous shows on Gabrielle Chanel, Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, and Jean Paul Gaultier. Gucci officially named dancer, singer, and songwriter Lee Know, of the K-pop group Stray Kids, as its newest Global Brand Ambassador on Monday. Regarding his new role, he shared in a press release, “I believe Gucci is a brand that transcends the past and present through heritage and contemporary creativity. It's a great honor to be part of Gucci's visionary journey.” He has long incorporated the brand's designs into his personal style and has attended numerous Gucci events prior to the official partnership announcement, including the Cruise 2025 fashion show in London last year. As a Global Brand Ambassador, Know is set to participate in future events, campaigns, and initiatives for Gucci, joining other notable ambassadors like Robert Pattinson, Kendall Jenner, and Dakota Johnson. Bottega Veneta announced Italian tennis champion Lorenzo Musetti's new ambassadorship this week, following his participation in the house's recent 'Craft is our Language' campaign. The campaign celebrated 50 years of their signature Intrecciato weave handbags and accessories. He joined fellow Bottega Veneta ambassadors such as Tyler, the Creator, Jack Antonoff, Lauren Hutton, and Julianne Moore to highlight the importance of hand language in craftsmanship and art. Lorenzo's feature focused on the beauty of the hand motions used in tennis. Musetti was ranked No. 6 in the Association of Tennis Professionals singles rankings in 2025, reaching the semifinals of both the 2024 Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 French Open. Representing Italy, he won bronze in men's singles at the 2024 Paris Olympics and led the Italian national team to victory in the 2023 and 2024 Davis Cup championship.","Plus, other must-know industry news you may have missed Welcome to the Week in Fashion, Bazaar's at-a-glance guide to what the industry is talking about.

mov_64B9F453620A286253B53B1518C7F200,"  Menswear is having a moment-and it's one women can (and should) steal from. As a womenswear editor, I rarely ventured into menswear, but Jonathan Anderson's debut collection for Dior at Men's Fashion Week in Paris has sparked my curiosity. In his first runway show for the house, where he now serves as creative director of both menswear and womenswear, Anderson offered a fresh take on formality laced with a casual ease. Suddenly, I'm considering candy-colored chinos and cable-knit sweaters, cargo pants in innovative new proportions, and even the possibility of a floral or silk moiré vest. Anderson layered the most impeccable crisp blue cotton poplins under knit capes. And his version of pajama dressing was polished enough to wear far beyond the bedroom. The men's shows were full of inspiration. At Prada, striped knits made a graphic statement—bold, unexpected, full of energy and intent. Meanwhile, at Saint Laurent, Anthony Vaccarello offered a color story I can't stop thinking about, with cherry, mustard, rust, and aubergine nonchalantly mixed. It's an unexpected combination that somehow feels exactly right. Julian Klausner's sarong at Dries Van Noten emerged as a new proposition—not just for the beach, but as a stylish, unexpected piece in everyday dressing. So yes, I want that perfect blue poplin striped shirt, neatly tucked into a belted paper-bag pant. I want a piped pajama shirt that's elevated enough for the office—and the perfect pink chinos too. Menswear this season isn't about old, gendered notions of dressing. It's about dressing with purpose and polish, while celebrating a fresh, unexpected mix of possibilities. The blue striped poplin shirt steps out of the basics pile and into the spotlight. Classic cargo pants return, reshaped with new volume, structure, and runway precision. Colors collide in this season's most surprising palette. Classic tailoring gets refreshed with sharply defined collars in contrasting colors and textures. The contrast-piped pajama shirt goes from sleepwear to boardroom with effortless elegance. Knits get graphic with unapologetically oversized stripes and playful palettes. The sarong gets recast as a wrapped, everyday essential—not just for the beach. Soft shades meet strong silhouettes—pastels never looked this confident.","Menswear is having a moment-and it's one women can (and should) steal from.

The blue striped poplin shirt steps out of the basics pile and into the spotlight. Classic cargo pants return, reshaped with new volume, structure, and runway precision. Colors collide in this season's most surprising palette. Classic tailoring gets refreshed with sharply defined collars in contrasting colors and textures. The contrast-piped pajama shirt goes from sleepwear to boardroom with effortless elegance. Knits get graphic with unapologetically oversized stripes and playful palettes. The sarong gets recast as a wrapped, everyday essential—not just for the beach.

「下班趕著去健身房運動，但是帶妝運動對皮膚不好⋯」大家都知道，運動後的汗水跟高體溫，會讓肌膚毛細孔張開，這個時候如果帶妝運動，毛孔就會被顆粒阻塞。 因此有些人會在運動前卸妝，避免傷害皮膚，但是這其中有什麼迷思呢？ ELLE在這訪問到皮膚科醫生，究竟帶妝運動會對肌膚造成什麼影響？ 又該如何選擇卸妝產品？ 一起來看看！ 「睡覺」也能消耗熱量？ 專家提3關鍵決定睡眠時燃燒多少卡路里，想躺著瘦要從睡好開始
帶妝運動為何可能傷肌膚？ COPYRIGHT: 
皮膚科顧問和英國皮膚基金會發言人Anjali Mahto醫生說： 「理想情況下，最好避免化妝到健身房運動。」 運動帶來的汗水和體溫升高會導致毛孔張開，而毛孔就會被化妝品顆粒堵塞。 這很容易導致爆痘，也會讓皮膚紋理不均勻。 另外，一般平均來說，人在一小時內會摸到自己的臉大概3.6次，而流汗時就會增加次數。 在運動時手腳在接觸瑜珈墊、自行車把手和重訓器材後又摸到臉，更會導致皮膚痤瘡。 化妝去運動究竟會不會使肌膚加速老化？ COPYRIGHT: 
所以，我們砸大錢買精華液、保濕來保養自己的皮膚，只要帶妝上健身房，就全都功虧一簣了嗎？ Mahto醫生表示：「這不一定。 身體對運動產生的自然生理反應，是產生汗水和熱量，即使帶妝運動會引起痘痘問題，但也沒有證據表明這樣會導致加速或過早老化。」 運動時忽略「防曬」才是大忌！ COPYRIGHT: 
以長遠來看，雖然帶妝運動可能不會對皮膚造成傷害，但如果在室外運動就要特別注意了。 Mahto醫生提醒大家，選擇防曬乳的防曬係數SPF非常重要。 這可以防止受到陽光帶來的肌膚傷害、皮膚癌和皮膚過早老化。 而比起化學防曬劑，礦物防曬霜可能對皮膚更好，尤其是如果你很容易痤瘡或有其他皮膚上的問題。 但是，如果是那些喜歡使用化學防曬劑的人來說，那麼凝膠狀配方可能比乳霜更好。 卸妝品怎麼挑？ 醫生提醒「這類型」卸妝少用
COPYRIGHT: 
市面上不少品牌推出油性卸妝產品，但Mahto醫生說，最好是再去健身房前，避免使用這些產品。 「除非你的皮膚非常乾燥、敏感，否則我不建議使用油性的卸妝產品。 很多油性產品是導致許多粉刺，甚至黑頭形成的原因。」 清潔肌膚的方式會對皮膚健康產生重大影響。 雖然在去健身房卸妝是一個好主意，但需要明確的掌握清潔方式。 過度洗淨只會導致乾燥、敏感和刺激。 不需要雙重清潔。 選對潔顏品也是養成好膚質關鍵！ COPYRIGHT: 
護膚專家Rosula Chapman也表示同意：「我建議溫和清潔。 含有乙醇酸的溫和泡沫或凝膠卸妝產品能更有效地去除化妝品和皮脂，同時還能使皮膚更光滑柔嫩，不會造成乾燥。」 面部護理師Sophie Ace則說：「去角質也有助於卸妝。 如果你的毛孔容易被堵塞，這些輕質的酸性產品會分解皮脂並阻止肌膚發炎。」 早上喝咖啡還是下午喝咖啡才健康？ 科學家揭露喝咖啡的最佳時機，喝對可以降低中風率並增進長壽

Muchas personas usan el término “perfume” para referirse a cualquier fragancia, pero no todas tienen la misma concentración ni duración. Las diferencias entre un perfume, un eau de parfum y un eau de toilette no solo radican en su nombre, sino también en su composición, intensidad y uso recomendado. Conocer estas variaciones es clave para elegir la opción más adecuada según el estilo de vida, el clima y el presupuesto. En el mercado mexicano, existe una amplia oferta que incluye desde marcas internacionales de alta gama hasta opciones accesibles y funcionales. Cada formato tiene sus ventajas dependiendo del contexto: si se busca una fragancia duradera para un evento especial, o algo más fresco y liviano para el día a día. Comprender estas diferencias ayuda a evitar errores comunes, cómo comprar una fragancia demasiado intensa para el uso diario. Este artículo detalla las particularidades de cada tipo de producto, presenta ejemplos representativos y ofrece recomendaciones prácticas para encontrar la fragancia ideal, ya sea de firmas de lujo o de marcas populares como los perfumes Aeropostale, Calvin Klein, Zara o Tous. Diferencias fundamentales entre las concentraciones Cada tipo de fragancia tiene una formulación distinta que influye directamente en su duración y proyección. ¿Qué es un perfume? El perfume o extrait de parfum es el formato más concentrado. Su contenido de aceites esenciales suele estar entre el 20 % y el 30 %, lo que le confiere una duración prolongada, a veces superior a 12 horas en la piel. Este tipo de fragancia es más costosa, pero también más persistente y sofisticada. Ejemplos comunes de perfumes concentrados incluyen Chanel No. 5 Extrait, Dior J'adore L'Absolu o Amouage Interlude Woman. Por su intensidad, se recomienda aplicarlos con moderación y reservarlos para eventos especiales o climas fríos, donde pueden desplegar todo su potencial sin resultar abrumadores. ¿Qué es un eau de parfum? El eau de parfum (EDP) es uno de los formatos más populares por su equilibrio entre duración y precio. Su concentración oscila entre el 15 % y el 20 %, lo que permite una fijación duradera de 6 a 8 horas, dependiendo del tipo de piel y las condiciones ambientales. Marcas como Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Carolina Herrera Good Girl, Montblanc Signature o los perfumes Aeropostale en su versión EDP son buenos ejemplos de esta categoría. Estas fragancias son ideales para el uso diario en ambientes cerrados o para quienes desean un aroma que permanezca durante toda la jornada. ¿Qué es un eau de toilette? El eau de toilette (EDT) contiene entre un 5 % y un 15 % de aceites aromáticos. Esto la convierte en una opción más ligera, con una duración que va de 3 a 5 horas. Es perfecta para climas cálidos, momentos casuales o como fragancia de reaplicación a lo largo del día. Algunos EDT populares son CK One, Versace Pour Femme Dylan Blue, Tous Touch o Light Blue de Dolce & Gabbana en su versión ligera. Son recomendables para quienes prefieren aromas sutiles y frescos que no invadan el espacio personal. Aplicaciones prácticas según el estilo de vida Cada formato responde a un tipo de uso diferente, según la ocasión y la rutina personal. Fragancias para el trabajo y el día a día Para entornos laborales o actividades cotidianas, el eau de toilette suele ser la mejor elección. Su ligereza evita que el aroma resulte molesto para los demás, y su frescura aporta una sensación de limpieza. También es común reaplicar este tipo de fragancia a lo largo del día sin saturar. Marcas como Zara, Burberry Weekend, Benetton Colors, o los perfumes Aeropostale presentan opciones adecuadas para este perfil de uso, especialmente en oficinas o ambientes escolares. Fragancias para eventos especiales Cuando se necesita una fragancia más notoria y duradera, como en bodas, cenas o reuniones nocturnas, lo ideal es optar por un perfume o un buen eau de parfum. Estas versiones logran mayor permanencia y proyección, creando una estela más distintiva. Algunas recomendaciones incluyen Lancome La Vie Est Belle, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Mugler Alien o Elie Saab Le Parfum. Estos productos se comportan bien en pieles secas o en climas templados. Cómo identificar el tipo de concentración Es clave revisar la etiqueta y los detalles del envase antes de comprar una fragancia. Qué buscar en la botella o caja Los productos suelen indicar claramente si se trata de un perfume, eau de parfum o eau de toilette. Estas leyendas aparecen junto al nombre de la fragancia, por lo general en francés. En caso de duda, también se puede consultar el porcentaje de concentración en la lista de ingredientes. Además, algunas marcas ofrecen el mismo aroma en diferentes concentraciones. Por ejemplo, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle tiene versiones tanto EDP cómo EDT, cada una con una estructura olfativa ligeramente distinta, pero fiel al ADN del perfume.

Une garde-robe faite pour un mariage d'une semaine L'ancien ancre de télévision et pilote d'hélicoptère a commandé 27 robes pour les célébrations de mariage, qui se sont déroulées sur plusieurs jours fin juin sur l'île de Majorque. Bien que le couple s'est officiellement marié lors d'une cérémonie privée à bord de 394 millions de livres sterling de Bezos (500 millions de dollars) Yacht Koru, les festivités ont duré plusieurs emplacements et thèmes. Sánchez aurait travaillé avec des maisons de mode de renommée mondiale, notamment Dolce & Gabbana, Dior, Valentino et Schiaparelli. Chaque look a été conçu pour correspondre à une partie spécifique de la célébration, des dîners avant le mariage aux rassemblements de yachts post-cérémonie. Mais malgré une planification méticuleuse, l'une des robes n'est jamais arrivée. La robe manquante a disparu en transit. Bien que Sánchez n'ait pas identifié le designer, elle l'a appelé «un mystère» et a dit: «Peut-être que ce n'était pas censé être». L'absence n'a pas fait dérailler les célébrations mais a ajouté une tournure inattendue à ce qui était autrement une affaire étroitement chorégraphiée. Une liste d'invités et un budget pour correspondre Le mariage, qui a eu lieu le week-end du 22 juin 2025, était tout sauf petit.

Le couple a loué un domaine du XVIe siècle dans les montagnes de Deià et a accueilli plusieurs rassemblements en plus de la cérémonie elle-même. Les installations florales, les menus sur mesure et la vaisselle des concepteurs auraient fait partie de l'expérience. Malgré sa taille, Sánchez a décrit le mariage dans son interview Vogue comme «intime et sacrée», une phrase qui a attiré des réactions mitigées en ligne. Une robe de mariée devient un sujet de discussion La nouvelle de la robe manquante, bien que mineure dans le contexte d'un événement aussi massif, est rapidement devenue symbolique de l'échelle et de l'excès entourant la célébration.

In the last 4 months, I went all in tried over 150+ decants, visited a few local perfumeries, and explored and owned tons of perfume oils beyond what I'm sharing in this post. After a lot of research (and a bit of obsession), I ended up collecting these fragrances, and let's just say… it became quite the addiction! That said, I've decided to hit pause and not buy any more fragrances for the rest of the year (with one exception that might arrive in the next couple of days). I'll still be around and happy to help anyone here however I can. Thanks again for being such a great part of this journey! **Note**: I am not an expert , I trust my nose more than reviews, please do research or test fragrances before you buy, I am from Middle east / Asia English is not my native language, I apologize in advance for any mistakes i try to explain this in my words without using any AI or correction tool. I am reviewing all fragrances after giving them time to mature. From Top Left to Right: 1. **Icon by Dunhill**: Really Good citrusy, Aromatic and floral scent. A good alternative for those who don't like sweet or overly citrusy scents for summer. 2. **1 Million Prive:** The most complimented one on my list, absolutely amazing winter scent with sweet and tobacco notes; I failed to find anything that can beat that fragrance. 3. **1 Million Elixir:** Very sweet and creamy vanilla with colorful floral tones, especially on the dry down. Lasts a long time and projection is strong. **4. **   **Jasoor:** Clone of VUBIR Coral Fantasy Long Lasting with Good projection, Very Versatile for year-round wear except very hot evenings. **5. **   **Asad Bourbon:** Clone that covers VUBIR Intense, Most Wanted and Stronger with you. Smells cozy and rich. Feels confident and warm. **6. **   **Khamrah :** Amazing Scent, Sweet,  Warm , Cozy with Vanilla and amber. 7. **Khamrah Dukhan:** I tried Liquid Burn, and to my nose, it smells quite similar that same warm, spicy DNA. But Khamrah Dukhan was much cheaper, so I went for it. It's incredibly long-lasting and feels like a spicier, less sweet version of Khamrah. If the sweetness in the original Khamrah isn't your thing, this might be a better fit. Honestly, it's underrated and didn't get the recognition it deserves from early buyers or reviewers. This one needs more attention, it's a hidden gem. 8. **Alpine Homme Sport**: Clone of Allure Homme Sport, as a Sporty scent both last 4-5 hours, and it's enough for a sports session, very good gym scent. 9. **CDN Precieux:** Clone of Aventus Absolu with Twist, Great performance and quality scent better and smoother when compared with Supremacy CE but costs more and feel more expensive **10. ** **Mont Blanc Starwalker:** absolute masterpiece a good night time / bedtime scent. Calming and relaxing, Hyped for a reason very unique scent. **11. ** **Dunhill Desire for a man:** Apple, Citrus and Rose based scent, classic cheap summer scent suitable for any age. 12. **L'Homme by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of L'Homme Lacoste, long lasting, sweet, citrusy fresh scent. FD is a small local perfumery in my area. 13. **L'Homme Intense by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of Dior Homme Intense, Dior Homme intense clones were mostly sold out and its hard to get them in my country so i visited a local perfumery where they had this clone its using same french oils used by other clone houses.

Or when you're obsessed with the quirky monster doll, Labubu, that everyone on social media seems to own? For some, the answer is simple: don't buy it. But for others - especially those stubborn, brand-loving souls - Indian markets have found a workaround. If you can't get the first copy, just buy the fifth one. And no, these aren't dupes with witty name changes or altered packaging. These are full-blown counterfeits: same branding, identical packaging, but at a mere fraction of the price. We took a deep dive into these murky online markets to find out what's being sold, how they are being sold, and more importantly, why so many people are buying them. But before we unpack all that, let's rewind a bit. The Rise Of India's Counterfeit Culture Counterfeit goods aren't new in India. They've existed in various forms for decades. When globalisation opened the floodgates to international brands, a majority of Indians found themselves unable to afford the real thing. The demand was high, but supply (at least the genuine kind) was out of reach. Naturally, the market responded in its own cheeky way. Think of places like D'manoj Pizza knocking off Domino's. Even when Domino's caught wind of the viral video of their doppelganger, their response was just as cheeky: ""Yahan ka address milega? (Can we get the address?)"" (Not a copyright claim) Today, that spirit has spilled across industries, from fast food to fashion to beauty. Markets like Sarojini Nagar in Delhi, Esplanade in Kolkata and Linking Road in Mumbai are prime examples, brimming with off-brand versions of luxury items. These IRL knock-offs often tweak a letter here, a logo there, or at least get the shade of lipstick slightly off. For beauty products though, the compromises run deeper - especially when it comes to ingredients and safety. But the game has changed online. Unlike the local bazaar, where, you know you're buying a knock-off, e-commerce marketplaces and social media are now peddling products that look identical to the original. Meesho, Facebook Marketplace, Amazon, Instagram... everyone is on it, and everyone is in on it. How These Fake Markets Operate Meesho Meesho is notorious (and simultaneously beloved) for offering bargain-basement prices. The brand claims this is possible because it eliminates middlemen, connects resellers directly to manufacturers, and focuses on lesser-known brands. But this has created the perfect breeding ground for fake products - especially viral beauty items. Take Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip treatment, for instance. Not officially available in India, but somehow being sold on Meesho for less than Rs 500. We even found fake Dior and Gisou lip oils, sold in nearly identical packaging but with slightly altered names. Facebook Marketplace It might not be trending in urban Gen Z circles, but Facebook Marketplace (FMP) is still massive. With over a billion global users shopping every month, it's a hotspot for everything from houseplants to handbags - and now, counterfeit beauty products in India.

The sheer scale of the platform makes it easy for scamsters to thrive with little scrutiny.

Unfortunately, many of them are hawking knock-off makeup and skincare products via Reels.

mov_C0098EC3FA197144538ECE4914F249FE,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Espectáculos    Presumen Bezos y Sánchez sus anillos tras lujosa boda     La pareja, sonriente y tomada de la mano, fue fotografiada lanzando besos a los presentes mientras abordaba un taxi acuático rumbo al famoso establecimiento veneciano    Agencia Reforma     disfrazada de jackie kennedy    Cumbre del mal gusto en la boda de Jeff Bezos en Venecia: «invitadas chonis» y millonarias desesperadas    Jeff Bezos, propietario de Amazon, ha sembrado de mal gusto y ostentación una de las ciudades con más historia y belleza de Europa: Venecia. Su boda, valorada en 50 millones de euros, demuestra que ni siquiera uno de los hombres más ricos del mundo puede comprarlo todo. La coyuntura de esta boda de Lauren Sánchez y Jeff Bezos no puede ser más cósmica: quién podía imaginar que los dos emperadores de Estados Unidos, el presidente Donald Trump y el propietario de Amazon, Jeff Bezos, pisarían el mismo suelo europeo en la misma semana. El primero acudió a La Haya para poner patas arriba la Cumbre de la OTAN en la que, según cuentan los análisis, casi todos le dieron a razón para que no cogiera una rabieta. El segundo ha querido casarse en la bella Venecia, parapetado en hoteles de siete estrellas y rodeado por marines disfrazados de guardaespaldas. Y una lista VIP estratosférica de invitadas con Rania de Jordania a la cabeza. Contemplar a estos dos hombres en acción es fascinante: tanto a Trump, creyendo que doblega con sus manotazos a los arteros diplomáticos europeos, como a Bezos, tirando besos y saludando como si fuera Beyoncé o Bad Bunny. Como si alguien le aclamara, vamos. Efectivamente, el emperador está desnudo y todas, al menos todas las que no hemos sido invitadas ni a la Cumbre de la OTAN ni a la boda en Venecia, podemos ver su ridiculez, más allá del maquillaje naranja de uno y la teatralidad extemporánea del otro. Pongamos algunas cifras encima de la mesa que suscriben la mejor teoría leída hasta la fecha acerca de esta gran ceremonia imperial de Bezos: «Esta boda 'chonea'», dictaminó el diseñador Juan Avellaneda, desde hace tiempo árbitro de la elegancia desde su perfil de Instagram. Avellaneda encuadró a muchas de las invitadas en el estilo 'choni', aunque quizá sin conocer demasiado bien la gracia plebeya y desparpajo popular de una verdadera choni de barrio. Lo que estamos viendo en Venecia no son chonis (ya quisieran). Son, sencillamente, millonarias desesperadas. Desesperadas por parecerse a Sofía Loren. Vamos con las cifras. Ya lo sabemos: Jeff Bezos se ha gastado alrededor de 50 millones de euros para regalarle a su novia, la presentadora de televisión Lauren Sánchez (ganadora de un Emmy en 1999), una boda para recordar. Y Venecia la recordará, de hecho, como la ceremonia más sucia que jamás vio la ciudad de los canales: nueve enormes yates fondearon en el abarrotado puerto y 90 aviones privados esperan en el aeropuerto Marco Polo para devolver a sus propietarios allá donde deseen. Jeff Bezos quiso cerrar para él el centro de Venecia     La ONG Consejo Internacional de Transporte Limpio ha calculado que generarán 5.000 toneladas de gases de efecto invernadero. Los novios pidieron a sus invitados que, en vez de regalos, hicieran donaciones a grupos ecologistas. Y, de hecho, muchos activistas han protestado de todas las maneras posibles por la irrupción de Bezos y Sánchez en Venecia y su intención de hacerse propietarios del lugar, cortando el tráfico aquí y allá, impidiendo el paso a los peatones, a golpe de talonario. Bezos ha logrado 'alquilar' Venecia solo en parte, pues se frustró su intención de casarse en un edificio histórico del centro de la ciudad. Tampoco tuvo suerte durante la esperada fiesta de la preboda del jueves: una tormenta bíblica hizo huir despavoridas y despeluchadas a las estrellas invitadas, que corrieron a sus lanchas para llegar a su hotel. Una venganza en toda regla de la Naturaleza que se celebró casi en cada hogar de la ciudad. Kim y Khloe Kardashian. GTRES     Pese a las protestas, los memes en las redes y el lema «No Kings No Bezos» ('No a los reyes, no a Bezos', una adaptación del grito anti Trump) proyectado con láser en la plaza de San Marcos, los novios no han dado muestras de captar el rechazo popular. Parece que la novia declaró lo siguiente en la noche del diluvio: «Estoy viviendo un cuento de hadas, estoy en el séptimo cielo en una ciudad maravillosa, con el hombre que amo. No podría ser más feliz». El alcalde sí que ha de estar feliz: calculó que el enlace entre Lauren Sánchez y Jeff Bezos podría generar un impacto económico total de unos 957 millones de euros, incluida una gigante campaña de publicidad. Algunos artesanos locales (porque los novios regalaron a sus invitados una pieza de cristalería de Murano y dulces de la confiteria Rosa Salva), empresas de taxis y las grandes cadenas de hoteles se llevarán su parte, pero muy poco de todo ese dinero irá a parar a los bolsillos de los vecinos que han soportado el evento. Lauren Sánchez lucirá una veintea de looks de lujo     Más números: se rumorea que Lauren Sánchez lucirá durante su estancia en Venecia 27 looks de alta costura, de los que de momento hemos visto un Schiaparelli apabullante. Al menos de frente, pues al ponerse de perfil el busto artificial de la novia deshace gran parte de su magia (Avellaneda dixit). ' The New York Times' publica que su estilista ha podido ser Anna Wintour, se supone que en su última comisión de servicio antes de abandonar la dirección de Vogue América, 37 años después. Suya pudo haber sido la idea de disfrazar a la novia de Jackie Kennedy con un look sesentero de Dior, horas antes de ponerse el traje de novia de Dolce & Gabbana. Pocos minutos después de que la novia dejara ver su vestido, Vogue lanzó en su website el reportaje del 'fitting' de Lauren Sánchez en el atelier de Dolce & Gabbana en Milán. «Me siento una princesa», exclamó al verse. Y desveló su inspiración, para sorpresa de nadie: el vestido de novia que lució Sofía Loren en 1958 para casarse con Cary Grant en la película Cintia (Houseboat). En la cena posterior, relata Vogue, la novia se puso un vestido inspirado en el que llevó Rita Hayworth en Gilda (1946). Y en la fiesta posterior, el protagonista fue un Oscar de la Renta con 175.000 cristales bordados. Ivanka Trump. GTRES     Si la preboda se celebró en los jardines de la iglesia del siglo XIV Madonna dell'Orto, con el clan Kardashian al completo imitando a Loren, Vitti o Bellucci sin ser nada de eso; la ceremonia tuvo lugar en el anfiteatro de mármol de la isla San Giorgio Maggiore, frente a la Plaza de San Marcos. Para esta cita, las invitadas VIP dieron el do de pecho del mal gusto.

Su boda, valorada en 50 millones de euros, demuestra que ni siquiera uno de los hombres más ricos del mundo puede comprarlo todo. La coyuntura de esta boda de Lauren Sánchez y Jeff Bezos no puede ser más cósmica: quién podía imaginar que los dos emperadores de Estados Unidos, el presidente Donald Trump y el propietario de Amazon, Jeff Bezos, pisarían el mismo suelo europeo en la misma semana. El primero acudió a La Haya para poner patas arriba la Cumbre de la OTAN en la que, según cuentan los análisis, casi todos le dieron a razón para que no cogiera una rabieta. El segundo ha querido casarse en la bella Venecia, parapetado en hoteles de siete estrellas y rodeado por marines disfrazados de guardaespaldas. Y una lista VIP estratosférica de invitadas con Rania de Jordania a la cabeza. Contemplar a estos dos hombres en acción es fascinante: tanto a Trump, creyendo que doblega con sus manotazos a los arteros diplomáticos europeos, como a Bezos, tirando besos y saludando como si fuera Beyoncé o Bad Bunny. Como si alguien le aclamara, vamos. Efectivamente, el emperador está desnudo y todas, al menos todas las que no hemos sido invitadas ni a la Cumbre de la OTAN ni a la boda en Venecia, podemos ver su ridiculez, más allá del maquillaje naranja de uno y la teatralidad extemporánea del otro. Pongamos algunas cifras encima de la mesa que suscriben la mejor teoría leída hasta la fecha acerca de esta gran ceremonia imperial de Bezos: «Esta boda 'chonea'», dictaminó el diseñador Juan Avellaneda, desde hace tiempo árbitro de la elegancia desde su perfil de Instagram. Avellaneda encuadró a muchas de las invitadas en el estilo 'choni', aunque quizá sin conocer demasiado bien la gracia plebeya y desparpajo popular de una verdadera choni de barrio. Lo que estamos viendo en Venecia no son chonis (ya quisieran). Son, sencillamente, millonarias desesperadas. Desesperadas por parecerse a Sofía Loren. Vamos con las cifras. Ya lo sabemos: Jeff Bezos se ha gastado alrededor de 50 millones de euros para regalarle a su novia, la presentadora de televisión Lauren Sánchez (ganadora de un Emmy en 1999), una boda para recordar. Y Venecia la recordará, de hecho, como la ceremonia más sucia que jamás vio la ciudad de los canales: nueve enormes yates fondearon en el abarrotado puerto y 90 aviones privados esperan en el aeropuerto Marco Polo para devolver a sus propietarios allá donde deseen. Jeff Bezos quiso cerrar para él el centro de Venecia La ONG Consejo Internacional de Transporte Limpio ha calculado que generarán 5.000 toneladas de gases de efecto invernadero. Los novios pidieron a sus invitados que, en vez de regalos, hicieran donaciones a grupos ecologistas. Y, de hecho, muchos activistas han protestado de todas las maneras posibles por la irrupción de Bezos y Sánchez en Venecia y su intención de hacerse propietarios del lugar, cortando el tráfico aquí y allá, impidiendo el paso a los peatones, a golpe de talonario. Bezos ha logrado 'alquilar' Venecia solo en parte, pues se frustró su intención de casarse en un edificio histórico del centro de la ciudad. Tampoco tuvo suerte durante la esperada fiesta de la preboda del jueves: una tormenta bíblica hizo huir despavoridas y despeluchadas a las estrellas invitadas, que corrieron a sus lanchas para llegar a su hotel. Una venganza en toda regla de la Naturaleza que se celebró casi en cada hogar de la ciudad. Kim y Khloe Kardashian. GTRES Pese a las protestas, los memes en las redes y el lema «No Kings No Bezos» ('No a los reyes, no a Bezos', una adaptación del grito anti Trump) proyectado con láser en la plaza de San Marcos, los novios no han dado muestras de captar el rechazo popular. Parece que la novia declaró lo siguiente en la noche del diluvio: «Estoy viviendo un cuento de hadas, estoy en el séptimo cielo en una ciudad maravillosa, con el hombre que amo. No podría ser más feliz». El alcalde sí que ha de estar feliz: calculó que el enlace entre Lauren Sánchez y Jeff Bezos podría generar un impacto económico total de unos 957 millones de euros, incluida una gigante campaña de publicidad. Algunos artesanos locales (porque los novios regalaron a sus invitados una pieza de cristalería de Murano y dulces de la confiteria Rosa Salva), empresas de taxis y las grandes cadenas de hoteles se llevarán su parte, pero muy poco de todo ese dinero irá a parar a los bolsillos de los vecinos que han soportado el evento. Lauren Sánchez lucirá una veintea de looks de lujo Más números: se rumorea que Lauren Sánchez lucirá durante su estancia en Venecia 27 looks de alta costura, de los que de momento hemos visto un Schiaparelli apabullante.

Suya pudo haber sido la idea de disfrazar a la novia de Jackie Kennedy con un look sesentero de Dior, horas antes de ponerse el traje de novia de Dolce & Gabbana. Pocos minutos después de que la novia dejara ver su vestido, Vogue lanzó en su website el reportaje del 'fitting' de Lauren Sánchez en el atelier de Dolce & Gabbana en Milán. «Me siento una princesa», exclamó al verse. Y desveló su inspiración, para sorpresa de nadie: el vestido de novia que lució Sofía Loren en 1958 para casarse con Cary Grant en la película Cintia (Houseboat). En la cena posterior, relata Vogue, la novia se puso un vestido inspirado en el que llevó Rita Hayworth en Gilda (1946). Y en la fiesta posterior, el protagonista fue un Oscar de la Renta con 175.000 cristales bordados. Ivanka Trump. GTRES Si la preboda se celebró en los jardines de la iglesia del siglo XIV Madonna dell'Orto, con el clan Kardashian al completo imitando a Loren, Vitti o Bellucci sin ser nada de eso; la ceremonia tuvo lugar en el anfiteatro de mármol de la isla San Giorgio Maggiore, frente a la Plaza de San Marcos.

VOGUE verrät, wie sie jetzt kombiniert werden. Diese 5 Schuhe aus den 80ern liegen jetzt wieder im Trend! Die Mode der 80er-Jahre ist schwer zu vergessen – die Schulterpolster zum Beispiel oder die knalligen Farben. Aber auch die ausgefallenen Schuhe aus dem vergangenen Jahrzehnt sind legendär und werden im Sommer 2025 wieder rauf und runter getragen – darunter Ballerinas, Slingbacks oder zweifarbige Pumps. VOGUE verrät, welche Modelle zurück auf dem Laufsteg – und der Straße – sind und wie sie heute kombiniert werden. 5 Modelle aus den 80ern, die im Sommer 2025 wieder angesagt sind #1 Ballerinas In den 30er-Jahren lancierten Designer:innen wie Christian Dior, Elsa Schiaparelli und Yves Saint Laurent die ersten Ballerinas, die nicht nur für ihre Eleganz, sondern auch für ihren Komfort gefeiert wurden. Später dann, in den 80er-Jahren, war auch Prinzessin Diana ein großer Fan der Silhouette; während Kate Moss und Alexa Chung in den späten 2000er- und frühen 2010er-Jahren zu den Anhängerinnen gehörten. Perry Ellis stellte 1987 ein schlichtes weißes Modell vor, das sie gepaart mit einem weißen, geradlinigen Look über den Laufsteg schickte. Nachdem die Modelle dann einige Jahre von der Bildfläche verschwunden waren, bahnten sie sich in den letzten Saisons ihren Weg zurück an die Spitze. Während in den 80er-Jahren aber vorrangig klassische Designs im Vordergrund standen, zeigen sich die Ballerinas heute verspielter – zum Beispiel aus Mesh oder PVC, mit Leoparden- oder Reptilmuster. Bei Chloé präsentierte Chemena Kamali beispielsweise eine geschnürte Boho-Version der Schuhe, die sie zu einem fließenden roséfarbenen Set kombinierte. #2 Slingbacks Apropos elegante Schuhe: Slingback-Modelle, also jene mit Riemchen um die Ferse, gehörten in den 80er-Jahren zur Arbeitsuniform der Frauen. 1987, als das sogenannte Power-Dressing in vollem Gange war, brauchte man ein Design, das bequem, aber dennoch formell war. So wählte Giorgio Armani für seine Kollektion im besagten Jahr Slingbacks, die er zu einer Bundfaltenhose, einer Bluse und einem Blazer mit breiten Schulterpolstern kombinierte. In 2025 kommen Slingbacks besonders gerne mit Kitten Heels daher – wie Marken wie Jacquemus, Contessa Mills und Tamara Ralph bestätigen. Letztere setzte auf eine schwarze Variante der Slingbacks und kombinierte sie mit einer samtigen Off-Shoulder-Bluse und einem Midirock mit Perlenverzierung. #3 T-Steg-Sandalen Sich von vergangenen Jahrzehnten inspirieren zu lassen, ist kein neues Konzept. Und während die Mode der 80er-Jahre der Welt eine Mischung aus Opulenz, Sinnlichkeit und Dramatik bescherte, brachte sie auch viele Elemente der 20er-Jahre zurück – wie lange Halsketten und T-Steg-Sandalen. Givenchy stellte in 1988 beispielsweise ein mit Polka Dots verziertes Modell vor – in Kombination mit einem trägerlosen Kleid im gleichen Muster. Es gab eine Zeit, in der Schuhe mit T-Steg als altmodisch galten. Jetzt, im Sommer 2025, finden die geschichtsträchtigen und mühelos eleganten Schuhe wieder Anklang. Christopher Esber, eine Marke mit australischen Wurzeln, verlieh ihnen mit einer Mesh-Variante und gestylt zum minimalistischen Ensemble aus einem weißen Neckholdertop und einer schwarzen Stoffhose einen modernen Dreh. #4 Oxford-Schuhe In den späten 80er-Jahren begann sich langsam der Minimalismus, der die nächsten Jahre prägen sollte, zu etablieren. Ein Stil, der sich durch androgyne Accessoires – wie zum Beispiel die Oxford-Schuhe – bemerkbar machte. Ralph Lauren hatte sie 1985 bereits mit Absatz vorgestellt; Helmut Lang und Yohji Yamamoto verwischten die Geschlechtergrenzen dann mit Versionen, die fast identisch zu den Herrenschuhen waren. Lang kombinierte sie mit einem langärmeligen Rollkragenkleid, Yamamoto mit einer weißen Oversize-Weste und einem blauen Satinrock. Oxford-Schuhe zogen sich wie ein roter Faden durch die Frühjahr/Sommer-Kollektion 2025 von Loewe. Anstatt sie wie damals zu ebenso androgynen Looks zu stylen, sorgte Jonathan Anderson für einen Stilbruch und kombinierte sie zu romantisch-verspielten Blumen- und Babydoll-Kleidern. #5 Zweifarbige Pumps Das Chanel der 80er-Jahre verkörperte einen Luxus, der sich durch Tweed-Sets, Perlenschmuck – und zweifarbige Pumps auszeichnete. Gründerin Coco Chanel trug oft selbst ein Paar mit niedrigem Absatz. 1982 (ein Jahr bevor Karl Lagerfeld zum französischen Modehaus stieß) sah man zweifarbige Pumps in Kombination mit einem weißen Kleid, einem schwarzen Blazer, Handschuhen, Gürteln und langen Perlenketten auf dem Laufsteg. Während diese klassischen schwarz-cremefarbenen Pumps weiterhin bei Chanel zu sehen sind, gibt es Häuser wie Nina Ricci oder Balmain, die die zweifarbigen Modelle ausgefallener – aber immer noch im gleichen Stil – interpretieren. Balmain setzte für den Sommer 2025 beispielsweise auf eine rot-goldene Version, gepaart mit einem Tweed-Minirock und einer passenden Jacke.","SPR_COMBO[de]Ob zweifarbige Pumps oder T-Steg-Sandalen: Einige Schuhe aus den 80er-Jahren erleben in 2025 ein Comeback.

In a notice posted on its website, Louis Vuitton Korea informed customers that a third-party entity temporarily accessed the company's systems on June 8 and leaked some customer information, reports Yonhap news agency. The company said it learnt of the incident on Wednesday. The compromised data may include customer names, contact details and additional information provided by customers, Louis Vuitton said, but stressed that no financial data, such as passwords and credit card numbers, was affected. The incident is the latest in a string of high-profile data leaks in the luxury sector in South Korea this year. In May, Dior apologised after discovering a data breach incident that occurred in January. Tiffany also revealed in May that it had suffered a breach in April. Cartier notified customers last month about a separate incident involving leaked personal information. 'Must It', a popular luxury goods e-commerce platform in South Korea, also reported two hacking attempts, coming in May and June. The company warned that user data, including names, gender and dates of birth, may have been stolen. Meanwhile, the South Korean government said on Friday it will fine SK Telecom Co. for belatedly reporting a data breach affecting all 25 million users and ordered it to waive customer cancellation fees, wrapping up its two-month probe into one of the worst data leak cases in the country's history. SK Telecom belatedly reported the breach in April, in which universal subscriber identity module (USIM) data was potentially leaked during an unidentified cyberattack on its servers.

A proposito proprio di vestiti: la sposa non si è certo limitata. Ha anzi portato con sé ben 27 abiti, da sfoggiare nell'arco dei tre giorni di sfarzosissimi e lussuosi festeggiamenti. Si è rivolta a diverse importanti Maison e come lei anche gli invitati. Tutto questo ha creato un certo movimento nel mondo della moda. Gli abiti del matrimonio di Lauren Sanchez e Jeff Bezos La sposa nel fatidico giorno del sì ha scelto una creazione firmata Dolce&Gabbana: un abito a sirena ispirato a Sofia Loren, in omaggio proprio all'Italia, che ha ospitato le nozze (e anche la luna di miele visto che ora i neo sposi sono in Sicilia). Tra gli altri brand a cui si è affidata: Alexander McQueen (il monospalla del primo giorno), Schiaparelli (un capo d'Alta Moda da circa 100mila euro), Alaia, Dior, Versace. Non sono mancati gli imprevisti: pare infatti che un vestito sia scomparso, forse rubato. E che dire dei look degli invitati. La guest list, top secret fino all'ultimo, includeva ospiti provenienti da ogni parte del mondo. C'erano Vittoria Ceretti con Leonardo Di Caprio, la regina Rania di Giordania, Kylie e Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Sydney Sweeney. Proprio l'attrice ha riscosso particolare successo coi suoi outfit. Lauren Sànchez in Schiaparelli Haute Couture Quali brand hanno guadagnato di più dalle nozze Secondo un report di Launchmetrics riportato da WWD, il matrimonio dell'imprenditore (fondatore e proprietario di Amazon) e della giornalista avrebbe prodotto ben 222 milioni di dollari di Media Impact Value (MIV). Sul fronte moda, pare ne abbia beneficiato soprattutto Dolce&Gabbana (avendo firmato l'abito bianco): si parla di una visibilità mediatica del valore di 14,5 milioni di dollari e di un incremento del 28% in quanto a esposizione mediatica nei giorni dell'evento. Il brand, tra l'altro, non ha vestito solo la sposa ma anche alcuni invitati: Vittoria Ceretti, Kylie Jenner, Sydney Sweeney. Il look Versace di Lauren Sanchez per il party Dolce Notte Bene anche per Schiaparelli, che ha realizzato il look del party pre nozze: ha generato 4 milioni di dollari, seguito da Versace che ha pensato al look post matrimonio con 2,8 milioni. Nella classifica stilata da Launchmetrics compaiono anche Alexander McQueen, Dilara Findikoglu (che ha vestito le sorelle Kardashian), Roberto Cavalli, la designer di gioielli Lorraine Schwartz e Tom Ford. Sydney Sweeney in Galia Lahav E che dire di Galia Lahav. Il brand ha firmato il look personalizzato di Sydney Sweeney per l'evento finale del sabato sera: l'abito da 25.000 dollari realizzato in 150 ore di lavoro ha avuto un impatto molto positivo per il brand.

Alcuni brand in particolare hanno guadagnato visibilità. 0 CONDIVISIONI Il matrimonio di Jeff Bezos e Lauren Sanchez ha catalizzato l'attenzione del mondo intero: la coppia si è sposata a Venezia e avrebbe speso secondo le stime 20 milioni di euro tra location, misure di sicurezza., catering, vestiti e quant'altro. A proposito proprio di vestiti: la sposa non si è certo limitata. Ha anzi portato con sé ben 27 abiti, da sfoggiare nell'arco dei tre giorni di sfarzosissimi e lussuosi festeggiamenti. Si è rivolta a diverse importanti Maison e come lei anche gli invitati. Tutto questo ha creato un certo movimento nel mondo della moda. Gli abiti del matrimonio di Lauren Sanchez e Jeff Bezos La sposa nel fatidico giorno del sì ha scelto una creazione firmata Dolce&Gabbana: un abito a sirena ispirato a Sofia Loren, in omaggio proprio all'Italia, che ha ospitato le nozze (e anche la luna di miele visto che ora i neo sposi sono in Sicilia). Tra gli altri brand a cui si è affidata: Alexander McQueen (il monospalla del primo giorno), Schiaparelli (un capo d'Alta Moda da circa 100mila euro), Alaia, Dior, Versace. Non sono mancati gli imprevisti: pare infatti che un vestito sia scomparso, forse rubato. E che dire dei look degli invitati. La guest list, top secret fino all'ultimo, includeva ospiti provenienti da ogni parte del mondo. C'erano Vittoria Ceretti con Leonardo Di Caprio, la regina Rania di Giordania, Kylie e Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Sydney Sweeney. Proprio l'attrice ha riscosso particolare successo coi suoi outfit. Lauren Sànchez in Schiaparelli Haute Couture Quali brand hanno guadagnato di più dalle nozze Secondo un report di Launchmetrics riportato da WWD, il matrimonio dell'imprenditore (fondatore e proprietario di Amazon) e della giornalista avrebbe prodotto ben 222 milioni di dollari di Media Impact Value (MIV). Sul fronte moda, pare ne abbia beneficiato soprattutto Dolce&Gabbana (avendo firmato l'abito bianco): si parla di una visibilità mediatica del valore di 14,5 milioni di dollari e di un incremento del 28% in quanto a esposizione mediatica nei giorni dell'evento. Il brand, tra l'altro, non ha vestito solo la sposa ma anche alcuni invitati: Vittoria Ceretti, Kylie Jenner, Sydney Sweeney. Il look Versace di Lauren Sanchez per il party Dolce Notte Bene anche per Schiaparelli, che ha realizzato il look del party pre nozze: ha generato 4 milioni di dollari, seguito da Versace che ha pensato al look post matrimonio con 2,8 milioni. Nella classifica stilata da Launchmetrics compaiono anche Alexander McQueen, Dilara Findikoglu (che ha vestito le sorelle Kardashian), Roberto Cavalli, la designer di gioielli Lorraine Schwartz e Tom Ford.

Според италианското издание ""Кориере дела Сера"", тоалет от впечатляващата сватбена колекция на Санчес липсва. Макар сред местните да се шушука, че роклята може да е открадната, до момента няма подаден сигнал или започнато разследване по случая. Все още не е ясно коя точно от зашеметяващите рокли на Санчес се е „изпарила“, но според ""Дейли Мейл"" най-ценната ѝ рокля – уникалната дантелена Dolce & Gabbana, с която тя мина под венчило, е в безопасност. Този впечатляващ модел е вдъхновен от визията на София Лорен в култовия филм ""Houseboat"" от 1958 г., където тя се омъжва за Кари Грант. Роклята на Санчес впечатли с дълги ръкави, корсетен силует, висока яка и типична „русалка“ пола. Отпред бяха зашити 180 копчета – стилно подчертаване на уникалния дизайн. ""Първоначално исках нещо модерно, изчистено и секси, а накрая се спрях на тоалет, който носи духа на момента и показва къде съм днес. Аз съм различна жена от тази преди пет години“, сподели новата госпожа Безос пред Vogue.

mov_85B88F3879C3CC38867E972D4AA36CAD,"  Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb - without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries, working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand - one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow, or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets it as a gown, be happy. One would be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires, but it has only two global consumer brands. Having a large home market - by volume, not value - our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts - a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation is the weakest form of 'sui-generis protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products', in Journal of Intellectual Property Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness, and accountability - pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous statutory drafting, sloppy marketing and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations to spur the ages- old artisanship and economically uplift kolhapuri makers. None of the large Indian business groups - those even in fashion or retail - have come forward yet to safeguard their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled sarees as part of a sustainability project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration of iconic monuments and archaeological sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged' by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia. Delhi-based Scot William Dalrymple has taken India's primordial gift for myth and narrative to make scholarship in history accessible. While the renaissance of modern Indian art owes much to Japanese businessman Masanori Fukuoka. Unless we own, defend and develop our own value chains, we shall continue to let our misplaced chauvinism get the better of us. The devil doesn't just wear Prada.","Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride.

    “时尚产业”是一个以创意设计为核心，融合文化、科技、艺术等要素，通过整合传统产业资源并注入时尚消费元素，形成的跨行业、跨领域的综合性产业集群  。 其核心特征包括：    
   •       高创意性    ：依赖设计师的艺术表达与市场趋势捕捉能力，如香奈儿的“小黑裙”通过简约设计引导女性着装趋势。 • 符号价值导向    ：产品不仅满足实用需求，更承载文化意义与身份标识，如奢侈品牌通过限量款传递稀缺性与社会地位。 • 产业融合性    ：覆盖从原材料（如丝绸、皮革）到终端消费（如服装、配饰、美妆）的全链条，并延伸至文化旅游、数字艺术等领域。 • 动态演化性    ：随社会价值观与技术革新持续迭代，如“可持续时尚”通过环保材料与循环经济模式重塑产业逻辑。 正因为“时尚产业”是一个动态演进的复合型生态系统，所以其细分领域会随着技术革新与消费升级而持续扩展。 结合当前全球的产业实践与前沿趋势，  可将“时尚产业”划分为六大核心领域及20+子赛道  ：   
   一、核心制造领域    
   1. 服装与服饰    
   • 奢侈与高端成衣  ：以工艺传承与品牌溢价为核心，如爱马仕的手工皮具、香奈儿的高级定制。 • 轻奢与设计师品牌    ：瞄准个性化需求，如上海时装周孵化的独立设计师品牌，通过小众设计实现差异化竞争。 • 快时尚与大众市场    ：ZARA、H&M等通过快速供应链响应潮流，优衣库以性价比基本款占据大众市场，竞争聚焦极致效率。 • 功能性服装    ：运动休闲、户外机能等细分赛道崛起，如始祖鸟融合专业功能与社交属性。 2. 鞋履与配饰    
   • 奢侈鞋履    ：Jimmy Choo的水晶鞋、Christian Louboutin的红底鞋，通过设计专利构建品牌壁垒。 • 运动鞋科技    ：耐克的气垫技术、安踏的氮科技，将运动性能与时尚设计结合。 • 配饰细分    ：珠宝（卡地亚）、腕表（劳力士）、箱包（LV）等传统品类，以及智能配饰（如BUTTONS的AI耳机）。 3. 美妆与个护    
   • 高端美妆    ：兰蔻、雅诗兰黛通过成分科技与品牌故事占据高端市场。 • 功效型护肤    ：修丽可的抗氧化精华、薇诺娜的敏感肌护理，以医学背书实现差异化。 • 可持续美妆    ：Lush的固体洗发皂、Aveda的环保包装，减少塑料使用。 下图：Jimmy Choo的水晶鞋（图源：m.dealmoon.co.uk）

While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb — without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries,   working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch   and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand — one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary   topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western   couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow,   or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri   has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets   it as a gown, be happy. One would   be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires,   but it has only two global consumer   brands. Having a large home market — by volume, not value — our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts   — a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation   is the weakest form of 'sui-generis   protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products',   in Journal of Intellectual Property   Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness,   and accountability — pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single   malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous   statutory drafting, sloppy marketing   and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative   zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism   of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace   and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations   to spur the ages old   artisanship and economically   uplift kolhapuri   makers. None of the large Indian business groups — those even in fashion or retail — have come forward yet to safeguard   their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative   process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled   sarees as part of a sustainability   project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration   of iconic monuments and archaeological   sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve   or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged'   by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar   to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia. Delhi-based Scot William Dalrymple has taken India's primordial gift for myth and narrative to make scholarship   in history accessible.

Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single   malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous   statutory drafting, sloppy marketing   and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative   zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism   of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace   and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations   to spur the agesold   artisanship and economically   uplift kolhapuri   makers. None of the large Indian business groups — those even in fashion or retail — have come forward yet to safeguard   their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative   process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled   sarees as part of a sustainability   project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration   of iconic monuments and archaeological   sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve   or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship.

The devil doesn't just wear Prada. arijit.barman@timesofindia.com","Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb — without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries, working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand — one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow, or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets it as a gown, be happy. One would be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires, but it has only two global consumer brands. Having a large home market — by volume, not value — our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts — a net $90 bn deficit.

mov_DD5460C3F6890BB8502192BE529181DA,  SPR_COMBO[fa]به گزارش خبرنگار اقتصادی خبرگزاری تسنیم؛ صنعت نساجی ایران، با وجود تمام چالش‌های محیطی و سیاسی، از جمله تحریم‌های بین‌المللی، دارای ظرفیت‌های فراوان و مزیت‌های نسبی منحصر به فردی است که کمتر به آن توجه شده است. این ظرفیت‌ها که از منابع طبیعی، نیروی انسانی خلاق و بازار مصرف داخلی نشأت می‌گیرد، همراه با توانمندی‌های فناورانه و ابتکارات نوآورانه، زمینه‌ساز رشد و توسعه پایدار در این صنعت می‌باشد. نگاه به بیرون و انتظار رفع تحریم‌ها یا مذاکرات بین‌المللی هرگز نباید نقطه اتکا و راه‌حل اصلی توسعه صنعت نساجی ایران باشد. بلکه باید با اتکا به دارایی‌های خود و استفاده هوشمندانه از فرصت‌های بومی و جهانی، مسیری مستقل و مقتدرانه برای پیشرفت این صنعت طراحی کنیم.  در این مقاله با مرور 40 ظرفیت کلیدی ایران و 27 ابتکار عمل در صنعت نساجی در سطح جهانی، چارچوبی عملیاتی و مبتنی بر واقعیت‌های کشور ارائه شده که می‌تواند ایران را از بند محدودیت‌ها رها ساخته و به جایگاه واقعی خود در بازارهای جهانی برساند. در همین زمینه بیشتر بخوانید الف) 28 تجربه جهانی در صنعت پوشاک و نساجی 1. انگلستان – آغاز صنعتی‌سازی با صنعت نساجی در انقلاب صنعتی قرن 18 انگلستان نخستین کشوری بود که در اواخر قرن 18 با بهره‌گیری از ماشین بخار و سازماندهی کارخانه‌ای، صنعت نساجی را به نقطه آغاز انقلاب صنعتی تبدیل کرد. توسعه ماشین‌های بافندگی، پیدایش کارخانه‌های متمرکز در منچستر و لیدز، و بهره‌برداری از استعمار هند به‌عنوان منبع پنبه خام، این کشور را در قرن 19 به قطب بی‌بدیل تولید پارچه بدل کرد. دولت بریتانیا با حفاظت از نوآوری‌های تکنولوژیک (مانند ماشین اسپینینگ جنی) و ممنوعیت صادرات ابزار تولید تا مدت‌ها از سلطه خود دفاع کرد. تجربه بریتانیا نشان می‌دهد که نساجی می‌تواند پیشران توسعه صنعتی و آغازگر زنجیره‌های بزرگ اشتغال باشد. 2. هند – احیای صنعت نساجی در قرن بیست و یکم با تمرکز بر پنبه و صادرات هند در سال‌های اخیر با صادرات بیش از 40 میلیارد دلار پوشاک و پارچه، به یکی از غول‌های جهانی در صنعت نساجی تبدیل شده است. این کشور با بهره‌گیری از پنبه داخلی، نیروی کار ارزان، و سیاست‌های حمایتی از زنجیره تولید، به‌ویژه در ایالت‌هایی مانند تامیل‌نادو، گجرات و ماهاراشترا، توانسته است مزیت مقیاس را تثبیت کند. نهادهایی مانند وزارت نساجی هند با ارائه یارانه صادرات، تسهیل‌گری در تأسیس پارک‌های صنعتی و ایجاد زنجیره‌های خوشه‌ای، این صنعت را به یکی از پایه‌های توسعه منطقه‌ای تبدیل کرده‌اند. هند همچنین با توسعه برندهای داخلی مانند FabIndia، در پی ارتقاء ارزش افزوده و طراحی بومی است. 3. ترکیه – توسعه صنعت پوشاک با تمرکز بر صادرات و برندهای بومی ترکیه در دو دهه گذشته با تمرکز بر صادرات به اروپا، برندهای موفقی مانند LC Waikiki، Koton و Mavi را در بازارهای بین‌المللی تثبیت کرده است. سیاست‌های ترکیه در دهه 1990 شامل آزادسازی کنترل دولتی، خصوصی‌سازی صنایع نساجی و تأسیس مناطق آزاد بود. استان‌هایی مانند دنیزلی، بورسا، و قاضی‌انتپ به مراکز تخصصی تولید پارچه و پوشاک بدل شدند. ترکیه همچنین زنجیره کامل از نخ‌ریسی تا طراحی مد و بازاریابی بین‌المللی را توسعه داد. تجربیات این کشور نشان می‌دهد که پیوند میان صنعت، صادرات، طراحی و برندینگ می‌تواند صنعت پوشاک را از خام‌فروشی به قدرت‌آفرینی اقتصادی برساند. 4. بنگلادش – ظهور به‌عنوان دومین صادرکننده پوشاک جهان با نیروی کار ارزان و سیاست تشویقی بنگلادش با صادرات بیش از 38 میلیارد دلار پوشاک در سال 2022، پس از چین دومین صادرکننده پوشاک دنیاست. نقطه قوت این کشور، نیروی کار بسیار ارزان و نظام مالیاتی و تجاری خاص مناطق ویژه صادراتی است. سیاست‌هایی چون معافیت مالیاتی، عدم وجود تعرفه بر واردات مواد اولیه، و حمایت از تأسیس کارخانه‌های کوچک و متوسط، باعث شده بیش از 4000 کارخانه پوشاک در بنگلادش فعال باشند. دولت بنگلادش با حمایت از آموزش زنان در مناطق روستایی و ایجاد زنجیره‌های خانوادگی تولید، از صنعت پوشاک به‌عنوان اهرمی برای توسعه فراگیر استفاده کرده است. 5. چین – ساخت زنجیره‌ کامل نساجی از پنبه‌کاری تا برندینگ جهانی چین از دهه 1980 با سیاست درهای باز، صنعت نساجی را به یکی از پیشران‌های صنعتی خود بدل ساخت. زنجیره تولید در چین، از کشت پنبه در ایالت‌های غربی، تا تولید ماشین‌آلات نساجی، دوخت، طراحی و فروش بین‌المللی گسترده است. مناطق ویژه اقتصادی مانند شنژن و شانگهای میزبان برندهای جهانی و کارخانه‌های بزرگ پوشاک شدند. علاوه بر تولید انبوه، چین با شرکت‌هایی مانند Bosideng یا Peacebird وارد حوزه طراحی و برندینگ جهانی نیز شد. دولت چین همچنین با انعقاد توافق‌های تجارت آزاد در جنوب شرق آسیا، صادرات نساجی را تسهیل کرده است. 6. ایتالیا – تقویت برندهای لوکس با تمرکز بر طراحی، کیفیت و مد پایدار ایتالیا به‌واسطه برندهایی چون Gucci، Prada، Armani و Dolce & Gabbana نماد طراحی فاخر در صنعت پوشاک است. این کشور زنجیره‌ای از کارگاه‌های خانوادگی، طراحان مستقل، دانشگاه‌های مد، و شرکت‌های بافندگی باکیفیت را در شمال ایتالیا – به‌ویژه در منطقه لمباردی – توسعه داده است. دولت با حمایت از صادرات برندهای لوکس، شرکت در نمایشگاه‌های جهانی، و استفاده از ابزار دیپلماسی فرهنگی، صنعت مد را به یک قدرت نرم بدل کرده است. تجربه ایتالیا نشان می‌دهد که تمرکز بر ارزش افزوده، طراحی و تولید محدود، برخلاف تولید انبوه، می‌تواند منجر به موقعیت ممتاز در بازار جهانی شود. 7. ویتنام – استفاده از توافقات تجارت آزاد برای توسعه صنعت پوشاک صادراتی ویتنام با بهره‌گیری از توافقنامه‌های تجارت آزاد با اتحادیه اروپا (EVFTA)، کره‌جنوبی، ژاپن و کشورهای ASEAN، تعرفه‌های صادراتی را کاهش داده و سرمایه‌گذاران خارجی را جذب کرده است. شهرهایی مانند هوشی‌مین و هانوی به مراکز تولید پوشاک برای برندهای بین‌المللی مانند H&M و Zara تبدیل شده‌اند. دولت با تأسیس پارک‌های صنعتی، حمایت از آموزش فنی در مدارس و معافیت مالیاتی برای سرمایه‌گذاری خارجی، رشد سریعی را در صنعت پوشاک رقم زده است....,SPR_COMBO[fa]به گزارش خبرنگار اقتصادی خبرگزاری تسنیم؛ صنعت نساجی ایران، با وجود تمام چالش‌های محیطی و سیاسی، از جمله تحریم‌های

Louis Vuitton、Chanel、Dior、Cartier、Hermès、YSL、Givenchy……
有没有发现，它们几乎都来自——法国‼️
这些品牌，构成了魅力法兰西🇫🇷的标志。 👑 一切从“太阳王”路易十四开始…
法国的奢侈品文化并非偶然，而是从王权时代就被“刻进DNA”。 17世纪，路易十四一边打造凡尔赛宫🌟，一边成立了皇家制造厂，让镜子这种奢侈品开始国产化。 奢侈品从王公贵族的宫廷生活延伸至工艺品、香水、家具🪑与时装👗，奠定了法国“时尚与奢华”的国家品牌。 为什么法国能称霸奢侈品界？ 🧐
这不是偶然，是一场“国家级的精心策划”：
1⃣ 历史文化传承：早在路易十四时代，奢华就已渗透进法国文化
2⃣ 政府全力扶持：法国政府长期为奢侈时尚行业提供资金、打击假货、保护品牌
3⃣ 手工艺精神：传承工坊文化，注重细节与品质
4⃣本地化营销：如在中国市场，会推出中式节日限定款
5⃣ 营造稀缺性：通过限量发售、候补名单营造“买不到”的高端感
6⃣银幕上的加持与文化影响：从赫本到梦露，明星效应强化法国品牌影响力✨
7⃣高端生活方式打造：不只是衣服包包，更是一种“精致的生活方式”
🫅强大的奢侈品集团
就像美国有科技四巨头 GAFA（Google、Amazon、Facebook、Apple）
法国也有自己的奢侈品四巨头——KHOL：
▪️Kering开云集团：旗下有Gucci、YSL、Balenciaga、BV等。 ▪️Hermès爱马仕：独立但实力强劲，球最难买的品牌之一，以手工工艺闻名。 ▪️L'Oréal欧莱雅：美妆界的王者，旗下包含Lancôme、YSL Beauty、Kiehl's等
▪️LVMH路威酩轩：涵盖Louis Vuitton、Dior、Celine、Fendi等80+品品牌。 这些集团凭借并购➕品牌矩阵➕高端战略，牢牢掌控全球市场话语权。 法国奢侈品，是艺术、工艺、身份与文化的集合。 不是一只包，而是一个故事📖
不是一瓶香水，而是一段传承💫

n1k5oym,"  Emmy is on my permanent shit list because of this incident. Sorry if it's a bit long… Back in 2010/2011 I was still in college and interning part time at a fashion PR agency. Basically in our office we also had a showroom with designer gowns, shoes, jewelry, etc of all the fashion brands that we represented. We represented anything from high end brands like Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, and Jimmy Choo, all the way down to smaller brands like Nicole Miller. The way it worked is that these gowns, etc would be rented out to celebrities to wear at red carpet events (or any big event where they'd be photographed). 90% of the time the stylists of these people would come in on their own, grab a bunch of items, and then return them after the event was done. However, every so often a celebrity would come in with them to pick out the pieces. One thing I should mention that's important to the story is that for the super luxury brands, we would only rent them out to super A list people (people like Angelina Jolie, Halle Berry, etc). For anyone B list or below we would only allow them to rent mid-size or smaller brands. This particular day, Emmy had come in with her stylist. Her stylist called us a head of time and demanded that we close off the show room to them only…. we don't usually do this, but we did it any ways. I was also told by my boss that Emmy was one of those people who didn't allow people to look at her or speak to her directly. The day Emmy and her stylist came in was a busy day for the actual publicists so I was instructed to help them pick out clothing. They also told me which designer dresses to not allow her to borrow. So Emmy and her stylist come in and while they're selecting items, I'm taking the inventory down. Emmy then gets to the Christian Dior rack and sees a dress she loves. Unfortunately that's one of the designers I'm not supposed to allow her to rent from. I let her stylist know this who then told Emmy. Emmy then starts throwing a full blown temper tantrum and starts yelling at me to the point where both my manager and the owner of the agency come out to calm her down. We then have to lie to her and say that this particular dress is already on hold for someone else. They ended up leaving with the other rented items, but after this the owner of an agency made it a rule that no celebrities are allowed to come in with their stylists. Usually stylists know which designers their clients can and can't wear, and banning clients from the office prevents a lot of drama.","Emmy is on my permanent shit list because of this incident.

离橘园美术馆很近（巴黎我最喜欢的美术馆之一），不到1.5公里，杜乐丽花园也在附近。 走到铁塔大概15分钟。 大部分购物的地方都在附近可以解决，完全不用担心交通，走路都能到。 远一点的出行基本靠Uber，很便捷。 需要早点预定哦。 🗼
最重要的就是选房型啦。 我定的是“Deluxe Double Room with Eiffel Tower View”。 阳台就能很清楚的看到铁塔，合影真是绝了，哈哈。 我后来还换了酒店，很复古很巴黎的一家，之后和大家分享~坦白讲还是这家房间大了很多，而且各方面都很不错，购物实在是很方便。 所以我觉得性价比还是蛮高的。 🤵🏻
服务很好~~很贴心，reception的小哥又帅又热情。 有一万下雨了，我们买了超多东西，帮我们提下车的，后来换酒店好几个大箱子也都帮我们搬上车，特别好。 另一家酒店就毫无服务可言😓

mov_22F328B20ED6775AE84036CE21A56C5F,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Khi các thương hiệu mỹ phẩm Hàn Quốc thâm nhập vào các mạng lưới phân phối trực tuyến và ngoại tuyến lớn ở nước ngoài, Hàn Quốc đang khẳng định vị thế là quốc gia xuất khẩu mỹ phẩm hàng đầu thế giới. Theo Hiệp hội các nhà sản xuất và nhập khẩu Nhật Bản, kim ngạch nhập khẩu mỹ phẩm Hàn Quốc của Nhật Bản trong năm 2024 đã lên tới 134,27 tỷ yen (khoảng 926 triệu USD), đứng đầu trong số tất cả các quốc gia nhập khẩu. Như vậy, Hàn Quốc đã giữ vị trí đầu tiên trên thị trường mỹ phẩm nhập khẩu tại Nhật Bản trong ba năm liên tiếp kể từ khi vượt qua Pháp vào năm 2022. Sự lan tỏa của mỹ phẩm Hàn Quốc cũng thể hiện rõ tại thị trường Mỹ, trung tâm tiêu dùng toàn cầu. Theo Ủy ban Thương mại quốc tế Mỹ, kim ngạch xuất khẩu mỹ phẩm của Hàn Quốc sang Mỹ năm 2024 đạt 2.500 tỷ won (tương đương khoảng 1,71 tỷ USD), vượt Pháp với 1,263 tỷ USD, quốc gia vốn nổi tiếng với các thương hiệu xa xỉ phẩm như Chanel và Dior. Đây là lần đầu tiên Mỹ phẩm Hàn Quốc vượt lên dẫn đầu trên thị trường mỹ phẩm nhập khẩu tại Mỹ. Kim ngạch xuất khẩu mỹ phẩm Hàn Quốc cũng đang tăng ở châu Âu, nhờ vào sự phổ biến ở Mỹ. Ảnh: creatrip.com Theo Tổng cục Hải quan Hàn Quốc, kim ngạch xuất khẩu mỹ phẩm của Hàn Quốc sang Anh năm 2024 đạt 149,37 triệu USD, tăng khoảng 48% so với 104,1 triệu USD của năm 2023. Trong cùng kỳ, kim ngạch xuất khẩu sang Ba Lan và Hà Lan tăng vọt lần lượt là 161,9% và 34%. Phân tích cho biết việc mỹ phẩm Hàn Quốc trở nên phổ biến trên các thị trường là nhờ ảnh hưởng lớn từ văn hóa Hàn Quốc. Doanh số bán sản phẩm ""Dewyful Water Tint"" được Wonhee, thành viên của nhóm nhạc thần tượng Ilitt, giới thiệu trong một chương trình thương mại trực tiếp vào tháng 1/2025, đã tăng vọt sau khi chương trình phát sóng. Theo CJ, doanh số bán hàng của thương hiệu Olive Young đã tăng 122% trong những ngày phát sóng trực tiếp. Có nhiều trường hợp, doanh số bán hàng tăng vọt ở nước ngoài khi một sản phẩm được đề cập trong nội dung nói chuyện của thần tượng K-pop. Giới chuyên gia cho biết sự lan tỏa của văn hóa Hàn Quốc thông qua nội dung Hallyu đã dẫn đến sự hình thành của một cộng đồng người hâm mộ và giờ đây nó đã trở thành một cấu trúc lan truyền theo thời gian thực thông qua SNS. Sự lan tỏa của văn hóa Hàn Quốc đã mang lại những thay đổi trong cấu trúc công nghiệp.

Giáo sư quản trị kinh doanh Seo Yong-gu thuộc Trường Đại học Sookmyung cho biết, Olive Young đóng vai trò là “người gác cổng” cho các thương hiệu độc lập và vì cần phải có một mức chất lượng nhất định mới có thể thâm nhập vào chuỗi cửa hàng Olive Young, nên người mua và người tiêu dùng ở nước ngoài chấp nhận các sản phẩm của Olive Young như một dấu hiệu của sự tin tưởng rằng chúng đã được thẩm định sát hạch về chất lượng. Các công ty mỹ phẩm lớn của Hàn Quốc cũng đang tích cực tận dụng làn sóng văn hóa Hàn để thúc đẩy tăng trưởng. Các doanh nghiệp lớn thường lựa chọn các ngôi sao K-pop hoặc diễn viên K-drama nổi tiếng ở nước ngoài làm đại sứ toàn cầu. Thương hiệu mỹ phẩm thuần chay Dalba đã chọn Hoshi, một thành viên của Seventeen, làm đại sứ toàn cầu châu Á vào năm 2023 để tiến vào Nhật Bản sau khi nhóm nhạc K-pop Seventeen trở nên nổi tiếng tại Nhật Bản. LG Household & Health Care đã chọn nữ diễn viên chính Kim Ji-won làm đại sứ toàn cầu từ tháng 7/2024 sau khi bộ phim truyền hình Hàn Quốc “Queen of Tears” trở nên nổi tiếng và được xuất khẩu sang nhiều quốc gia. Tập đoàn CJ đã lập một gian hàng Olive Young tại lễ hội Làn sóng Hàn Quốc toàn diện KCON để giới thiệu các sản phẩm từ các đối tác K-beauty. Năm nay, công ty đã lập một gian hàng KCON lớn tại Nhật Bản nhân dịp hội chợ Makuhari Messe tổ chức ở tỉnh Chiba từ ngày 9-11/6. Tại đây, CJ đã giới thiệu khoảng 40 thương hiệu K-beauty và 100 sản phẩm cho người hâm mộ Nhật Bản. Tổng số lượng khách tham quan gian hàng trong suốt sự kiện là khoảng 48.000 lượt người. Các chuyên gia dự đoán rằng triển vọng và sự lan tỏa của các thương hiệu K-beauty sẽ mở rộng hơn nữa trong thời gian tới nhờ vào sự tương tác với văn hóa Hàn Quốc. Giáo sư Lee Jong-woo thuộc Khoa Quản trị kinh doanh trường Đại học Ajou cho biết, khi làn sóng Hàn lan tỏa từ Thái Lan và Việt Nam đến Châu Phi, đã có những doanh nghiệp địa phương ở Kenya và Nigeria gửi chào hàng trực tiếp đến các doanh nghiệp vừa và nhỏ sản xuất mỹ phẩm Hàn Quốc. Tuy nhiên, nếu tính đến hiệu quả, căn cứ trên mạng lưới phân phối và mức thu nhập, có thể mất một thời gian để các thương hiệu ổn định và phổ biến trên thị trường.",2025-07-06 05:24:04,vi,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The text is a comprehensive article about the growth and global expansion of Korean beauty (K-beauty) brands and their export markets.

mov_875F6DF48F9D79680C77223E6C1DDA4C,"  FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — America's largest trade partner, the European Union, is among the entities awaiting word Monday on whether U.S. President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on their goods, a move economists have warned would have repercussions for companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations. Expressing displeasure the EU's stance in trade talks, however, the president said he would jack up the tariff rate for European exports to 50%. A rate that high could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals much more expensive in the U.S. The EU, whose 27 member nations operate as a single economic bloc, said its leaders hoped to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Without one, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes. Here are important things to know about trade between the United States and the European Union. US-EU trade is enormous A lot of money is at stake in the trade talks. The EU's executive commission describes the trade between the U.S. and the EU as ""the most important commercial relationship in the world.” The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat. The biggest U.S. export to Europe is crude oil, followed by pharmaceuticals, aircraft, automobiles, and medical and diagnostic equipment. Europe's biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits. EU sells more to the US than vice versa Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro ($233 billion) trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more stuff from European businesses than the other way around. However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services. The U.S. services surplus took the nation's trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade. What are the issues dividing the two sides? Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products. But the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts. Trump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef. Trump has also criticized Europe's value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%. But many economists see VAT as trade-neutral since they apply to domestic goods and services as well as imported ones. Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren't on the table during trade negotiations. “On the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg bank, said. “They cannot change the way they run the EU's vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.” What are potential impacts of higher tariffs? Economists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers. Mercedes-Benz dealers in the US. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices “until further notice.” The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo “significant increases” in coming years. Simon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said. Trump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to shift some production stateside. France-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company's annual meeting in April. Arnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions. “If we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,” Arnault said. “And if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ... It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.” Many expect Trump to drop his most drastic demands Some forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail. Without a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.

Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance.

Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren't on the table . “On the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg bank, said. “They cannot change the way they run the EU's vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.” What are potential impacts of higher tariffs? Economists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers. Mercedes-Benz dealers in the US. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices “until further notice.” The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo “significant increases” in coming years. Simon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said. Trump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to stateside. France-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company's annual meeting in April. Arnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions. “If we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,” Arnault said. “And if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ...

mov_C61CC731579A779BFCA352A01BA4F999,"  FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — America's largest trade partner, the European Union, is among the entities awaiting word Monday on whether U.S. President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on their goods, a move economists have warned would have repercussions for companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations. Expressing displeasure the EU's stance in trade talks, however, the president said he would jack up the tariff rate for European exports to 50%. A rate that high could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals much more expensive in the U.S. The EU, whose 27 member nations operate as a single economic bloc, said its leaders hoped to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Without one, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes. Here are important things to know about trade between the United States and the European Union. US-EU trade is enormous A lot of money is at stake in the trade talks. The EU's executive commission describes the trade between the U.S. and the EU as ""the most important commercial relationship in the world.” The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat. The biggest U.S. export to Europe is crude oil, followed by pharmaceuticals, aircraft, automobiles, and medical and diagnostic equipment. Europe's biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits. EU sells more to the US than vice versa Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro ($233 billion) trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more stuff from European businesses than the other way around. However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services. The U.S. services surplus took the nation's trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade. What are the issues dividing the two sides? Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products. But the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts. Trump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef. Trump has also criticized Europe's value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%.

Ricordo ancora l'avvincente relazione di Massimo Delledonne, professore ordinario di genetica all'Università di Verona, che fu il primo a scrivere la sua tesi di laurea con il pc, mentre i suoi colleghi ancora usavano la Olivetti Lettera 22. Nel 2014 ci preconizzò: ""Un giorno in farmacia ci daranno medicine compatibili con il nostro patrimonio cromosomico"". Aveva sequenziato per anni il Dna di tutti gli esseri viventi, a cominciare dal suo». Perché Ted ha nominato ambassador proprio lei? «L'evento annuale di Verona, del quale sono licenziatario, è uno dei più qualificati in Italia. Nel 2023 vennero qui 300 organizzatori di Tedx nel mondo, persino dall'Argentina, dal Giappone, dai Paesi arabi». Ha ospitato relatori famosi. «Molti. Fra loro, Simon Lancaster, l'ex ghost-writer del premier britannico Tony Blair. La sua relazione sul linguaggio segreto che assicura la leadership a chi raggiunge i vertici della politica e degli affari, tenuta a Tedx Verona nel 2016, finora è stata vista su Youtube da 4,7 milioni di persone». Sfruttate i social. «Parecchio. Abbiamo un pubblico giovane. Impressiona il fatto che a ogni nuovo evento almeno 180 candidati, in prevalenza donne, aderiscano all'appello per venire come volontari ad aiutare in Tedx». Come si chiamano coloro che partecipano a questi incontri? «Qualcuno li definisce tedxers, in italiano tedxari».

E talvez não exista ocasião melhor para observar essa dinâmica em ação do que durante os grandes eventos culturais do Cariri, como a Festa do Pau da Bandeira, o Juaforró e, claro, a aguardada Expocrato. A cada edição, o que vemos é uma verdadeira passarela a céu aberto, onde a movimentação do público revela mais do que tendências: mostra como identidade, memória e desejo se cruzam na construção do vestir. Em 2025, o que se destaca é a pluralidade. Se antes havia uma separação nítida entre o que era “moda da cidade” e o “estilo do sertão”, hoje esses limites estão cada vez mais borrados — e é aí que mora a riqueza. O streetwear dialoga com o forró raiz, o boho abraça o country, o artesanal invade o urbano. A moda no Cariri não copia: ela reinventa. E o resultado são looks autorais, criativos, e muitas vezes mais relevantes do que os que vemos nas grandes passarelas. Neste momento da temporada fashion, as lojas varejistas do Cariri já começam a lançar suas Coleções Expocrato . Enquanto influenciadores digitais promovem marcas e produtos que, muitas vezes, não refletem a realidade ou o estilo do público que frequenta o evento, os consumidores saem em busca de visuais que combinem com o clima da festa — sem abrir mão do custo-benefício. Conforto ou beleza? Eis a questão que pauta as escolhas do guarda-roupa.   Edição da Expocrato 2025 acontece do dia 11 a 20 de junho.

A cultura pop tem jogado luz sobre o country com narrativas que atualizam seus códigos visuais — como fez Beyoncé em Cowboy Carter , misturando herança negra, orgulho texano e estética maximalista. E ela não está sozinha: artistas como Lil Nas X, Dua Lipa e Post Malone também embarcaram nessa vibe western , misturando tradição e modernidade nos palcos e videoclipes. A tendência ultrapassou o universo musical e chegou às telas. Séries como Yellowstone (2018–2024) e Godless (2017), ambientadas no Oeste americano do século XIX, ajudaram a reacender o fascínio por esse visual rústico. Já nas passarelas, o xadrez — presença obrigatória no guarda-roupa sertanejo — apareceu com força na coleção Cruise 2025 , da marca francesa Dior, mostrando que até o luxo de grife se rende ao charme do country.   Coleção Cruise 2025, da marca Dior. Foto: Divulgação.   O sertanejo remixado  No Cariri, a moda western ganha uma releitura moderna e funcional, adaptada ao calor, ao ritmo dos eventos e ao estilo de quem frequenta festas como a Expocrato. Coturnos e botas de cano alto são os queridinhos da vez, assim como saias de couro, jaquetas de camurça, calças jeans de cintura alta e cintos com fivelas marcantes. A combinação certa entre esses elementos garante um visual estiloso, sem abrir mão do conforto necessário para dançar e curtir. O varejo local oferece conjuntos completos inspirados no western por preços que cabem no bolso — a partir de R$ 250. Já plataformas online, como a Shein, disponibilizam calças de couro ecológico por cerca de R$ 150. A dica é investir em peças-chave que podem ser reaproveitadas em outras ocasiões, como uma boa bota ou um cinto com design diferenciado. Para completar as composições, vale apostar em acessórios com pegada boho ou rústica : brincos de argola, colares com pedras naturais, lenços no pescoço e até bolsas com franjas. O importante é montar um visual que una identidade, conforto e ousadia — com o carimbo do Cariri.   Inspirações de visuais que fazem referência ao country repaginado.

Com elementos em comum com a estética country, como botas, acessórios marcantes e jeans, o boho pode facilmente se misturar a ela.

Um dos maiores ícones recentes dessa estética é a personagem Daisy Jones, da série Daisy Jones & The Six , da Amazon Prime Video.

Tems, on the other hand, made history as the highest-ranked and only female African artist on the all-time list. Her Grammy-winning appearance on “Wait For U,” a collaboration with Future and Drake, catapulted her to new heights. The song, released in 2022, received widespread acclaim and reinforced her global appeal. Beyond the streaming milestones, Tems has also been in the spotlight for her impactful contributions to women in music. Her recently launched initiative aims to empower and support female creatives across Africa's music industry—adding a layer of purpose to her already impressive artistic journey. With this achievement, Wizkid and Tems have once again elevated Afrobeats and African music to the global stage, reinforcing the continent's growing dominance in mainstream music conversations.

As she prepares to welcome her third child with A$AP Rocky, the Fenty founder and Smurfs star is getting a whole lot of love, support, and late-night snack deliveries from her partner of five years. According to People, the couple is “thrilled” to be growing their family again, and sources close to the pair say this pregnancy feels different — softer, slower, and somehow even more full of love. “He's completely tuned into her needs,” the insider shared of Rocky, who's been “incredibly attentive and nurturing” as Rihanna rests and gets ready for baby no. 3. Related story Rihanna's Baby Bump Is on Full Display at the Met Gala After Revealing Her 3rd Pregnancy While some dads might think diaper duty earns them a gold star, Rocky's in full-service mode.

Even if he doesn't help dress the kids — “That's their mother by herself,” he admitted last year — he still plays muse. “Sometimes she dresses them like me… kilts and all of that,” he said.

mov_27BE02CBCEF34829295F83084B026868,"  After a year of musical chairs in fashion, September is gearing up to be one of its biggest show months ever: with debut collections slated from new creative directors at brands including Matthieu Blazy at Chanel and ex-Balenciaga designer Demna at Gucci. On Sunday in Paris, Michael Rider, who recently succeeded Hedi Slimane at Celine, decided to get a head start. Acting as a sort of amuse bouche for how he plans to shape the brand's future, Rider showed a mixture of men's and womenswear. The show took place at the brand's sprawling atelier, a short hop from the Tuileries Garden. Guests included the actor Naomi Watts and, fresh from 18 months of South Korean military service, Kim Taehyung, from the K-pop band BTS, who attempted to shelter from the rain under a giant silk foulard that had been erected above a courtyard. It was a full-circle moment for Rider, an American designer who previously worked under Phoebe Philo during her tenure at the brand from 2008 to 2017. While fans of her work, known as “Philophiles”, had hoped Rider would reinstate that era of louche tailoring and minimalism, his opening looks quickly curtailed such expectations. Instead of oversized silhouettes, there was a series of skinny jeans and even skinner trousers, hugging calves so tightly, they should have come with a circulation warning. These lean silhouettes were a nod to his predecessor, Slimane, who honed his signature sharp-edged style during his stints at Saint Laurent and Dior Homme before introducing it to Celine. Despite initial criticism, Slimane proved lucrative for Celine's parent company LVMH. According to analysts, he was estimated to have doubled Celine's annual sales to €2.5bn (£2.1bn), transforming it into LVMH's third-largest brand, sitting behind Louis Vuitton and Dior. However, in October, he resigned with rumours of failed contract negotiations to blame. It's now up to Rider to pick up that moneyed baton. Rider's appointment comes at a difficult time in the fashion industry, with a significant slowdown across luxury markets (for the first quarter of 2025, LVMH reported a 4% sales drop across fashion and leather goods). At the annual general meeting in April 2024, LVMH's chief executive, Bernard Arnault, said: “Celine is chic, hip, sexy fashion for young people even if the prices are what they are, and it works.” Rather than wiping the slate clean, during this period of uncertainty, it appears that Rider is set on evolving on the brand's existing tried and tested formula. Speaking backstage after the show, Rider said he “did not want there to be a sense of erasure”, adding that “there was a foundation to build on. That to me felt modern, it felt ethical, it felt strong.” Rider balanced this homage to the past by intertwining it with his own fashion story. There were nods to his American roots and recent stint as design director of Polo Ralph Lauren, with punchy, coloured knitted V-neck jumpers, neat Oxford shirts and striped ties. Simple evening looks in black including an off-the-shoulder dress and satin lapelled blazers seemed to subtly recall his previous time at Celine. Accessories, which are easier for luxury brands to shift than a £5k coat, were a focus. Models' fingers came covered in multiple gold and primary coloured rings. Chunky bangles were stacked on forearms. Giant chain link necklaces were mishmashed. Keyrings jingled with everything from dices to miniature Eiffel Towers. Rider said he wanted to inject an element of fun. “I would never want to be perceived as cynical. Having a sense of humour in the luxury space is a beautiful thing,” he said. Bags ranging from colossal woven baskets and enormous leather totes to dainty pouches were emblazoned with logos ranging from a simple C to a “Triomphe” monogram, first created by the house's founder Céline Vipiana in 1971. Rider said he was drawn to a logo's fluid nature. “They can move from something really tasteful to quickly something that is very different from that. They can be many things.”","After a year of musical chairs in fashion, September is gearing up to be one of its biggest show months ever: with debut collections slated from new creative directors at brands including Matthieu Blazy at Chanel and ex-Balenciaga designer Demna at Gucci. On Sunday in Paris, Michael Rider, who recently succeeded Hedi Slimane at Celine, decided to get a head start. Acting as a sort of amuse bouche for how he plans to shape the brand's future, Rider showed a mixture of men's and womenswear. The show took place at the brand's sprawling atelier, a short hop from the Tuileries Garden. Guests included the actor Naomi Watts and, fresh from 18 months of South Korean military service, Kim Taehyung, from the K-pop band BTS, who attempted to shelter from the rain under a giant silk foulard that had been erected above a courtyard. It was a full-circle moment for Rider, an American designer who previously worked under Phoebe Philo during her tenure at the brand from 2008 to 2017. While fans of her work, known as “Philophiles”, had hoped Rider would reinstate that era of louche tailoring and minimalism, his opening looks quickly curtailed such expectations. Instead of oversized silhouettes, there was a series of skinny jeans and even skinner trousers, hugging calves so tightly, they should have come with a circulation warning. These lean silhouettes were a nod to his predecessor, Slimane, who honed his signature sharp-edged style during his stints at Saint Laurent and Dior Homme before introducing it to Celine. Despite initial criticism, Slimane proved lucrative for Celine's parent company LVMH. According to analysts, he was estimated to have doubled Celine's annual sales to €2.5bn (£2.1bn), transforming it into LVMH's third-largest brand, sitting behind Louis Vuitton and Dior. However, in October, he resigned with rumours of failed contract negotiations to blame. It's now up to Rider to pick up that moneyed baton.

I've been to events before, but this one felt... different. Intimate. Magical. Deeply cultural. Have you ever walked into a room and felt like you were stepping into someone's fairytale? Phones Down, Glam On Before entering the venue, we were asked to seal our phones in small plastic pouches — no cameras, no social media, no distractions. At first, I felt the reflex to reach for my phone, to capture something, anything... but then I realized: maybe this night isn't meant to be captured. Maybe it's meant to be lived. Would you be okay giving up your phone for the night if it meant being fully present? An Entrance Fit for a Queen To the right: a mini salon for touch-ups. To the left: a coffee bar with Arabic blends and Turkish tea. And everywhere in between: fresh flowers, oversized mirrors, and perfume stations filled with Chanel, Dior, and elegant oud blends that lingered in the air like poetry. Before stepping into the event hall, we were in abayas. But just before entering, we gracefully took them off, revealing our evening gowns — each one more stunning than the next. Mine was a sparkly silver piece, but honestly? Every woman in that room looked like art. A Celebration of Femininity and Tradition We greeted one another cheek to cheek, guided to our table by the bride's sister. Even the servers wore pressed uniforms, gracefully pouring endless cups of karak and herbal tea. Everything was intentional — from the Narumi bone china plates to the floral centerpieces that stood tall like sculptures. And the food? Think creamy hummus, beef stew, chicken biryani, sambusa, and more. But more than taste, it was the energy of being surrounded by women in full bloom — confident, graceful, glowing — that truly fed my soul. Have you ever felt beauty in a room so strongly, it didn't need to be said out loud? Then She Walked In... The bride entered like a vision — her dress glittering like stardust, her pace soft and steady. Romantic music filled the room. Big screens framed her walk to the stage. She looked like she belonged in a fairytale, but one grounded in heritage and pride. There was a collective pause, a silent awe — the kind you don't interrupt. A Shift in Energy Later, we were asked to wear our abayas again — the groom and his family were about to arrive. The vibe shifted: a little more formal, a little more sacred. I watched as he gazed at the bride, visibly in love. And though no photos were allowed, that moment will live in my memory far longer than anything I could've posted. What This Night Taught Me It reminded me that sometimes, the most beautiful moments are the ones we don't capture. That elegance isn't about extravagance — it's about intention. And that when women come together in celebration, something powerful happens. Would you say yes to attending a wedding like this if invited? Would you leave your phone behind and trust the moment to hold itself? Let's Talk: Have you ever experienced a wedding that made you feel something this deeply?

mov_73128F4F605401BDB64B9B418DCB4B50,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Nach einem Jahr voller Musikstühle in der Mode ist der September eine seiner größten Showmonate aller Zeiten aller Zeiten vorbereitet: mit Debütsammlungen, die von neuen kreativen Direktoren bei Marken wie Matthieu Blazy bei Chanel und Ex-Balenciaga-Designer Demna bei Gucci abgefeuert wurden. Am Sonntag in Paris beschloss Michael Rider, der kürzlich Hedi Slimane bei Celine nachfolgt, einen Vorsprung. In einer Amuse-Bouche für die Art und Weise, wie er die Zukunft der Marke gestalten will, zeigte Rider eine Mischung aus Männern und Damenbekleidung. Die Show fand im weitläufigen Atelier der Marke statt, einem kurzen Sprung vom Tuileries Garden. Zu den Gästen gehörten der Schauspieler Naomi Watts und frisch aus 18 Monaten südkoreanischer Militärdienst, Kim Taehyung, von der K-Pop-Band BTS, die versuchte, unter einer riesigen Seide vor dem Regen zu schützen Das war über einem Innenhof errichtet worden. Für Rider, eine amerikanische Designerin, die zuvor während ihrer Amtszeit bei der Marke von 2008 bis 2017 unter Phoebe Philo arbeitete, war es ein Vollkreismoment. Während Fans ihrer Arbeit, bekannt als „Philophile“, gehofft hatten, dass Rider diese Ära der Louche -Schneiderei und des Minimalismus wieder einstellen würde, hat seine Eröffnungsaussehen solche Erwartungen schnell eingeschränkt. Anstelle von übergroßen Silhouetten gab es eine Reihe von Skinny -Jeans und sogar Skinner -Hosen, die Kälber so fest umarmten, dass sie mit einer Aufzirkulationswarnung einhergehen sollen. Diese mageren Silhouetten waren eine Anspielung auf seinen Vorgänger Slimane, der seinen charakteristischen, scharfkantigen Stil während seiner Stationen in Saint Laurent und Dior Homme verbesserte, bevor er ihn Celine vorstellte. Trotz anfänglicher Kritik erwies sich Slimane für die Muttergesellschaft LVMH von Celine lukrativ. Laut Analysten wurde er schätzungsweise den Jahresumsatz von Celine auf 2,5 Mrd. EUR (2,1 Mrd. GBP) verdoppelt und ihn hinter Louis Vuitton und Dior in die drittgrößte Marke von LVMH verwandelt. Im Oktober trat er jedoch unter Gerüchten über gescheiterte Vertragsverhandlungen zurück. Es liegt jetzt an Rider, diesen Geldstab zu holen. Die Ernennung von Rider erfolgt zu einer schwierigen Zeit in der Modebranche, wobei die Luxusmärkte erheblich verlangsamt haben (im ersten Quartal von 2025 meldete LVMH einen Umsatzrückgang von 4% gegenüber Mode- und Lederwaren). Auf der Jahreshauptversammlung im April 2024 sagte der Geschäftsführer von LVMH, Bernard Arnault,: „Celine ist schick, hip, sexy Mode für junge Menschen, auch wenn die Preise so sind, wie sie sind, und es funktioniert. “ Anstatt den Schiefer in dieser Zeit der Unsicherheit sauber zu löschen, scheint es, dass sich der Fahrer an der vorhandenen bewährten Formel der Marke weiterentwickelt. Nach der Show hinter der Bühne sagte Rider und sagte, er wollte nicht, dass es ein Gefühl der Löschung gibt “und fügte hinzu, dass” es eine Grundlage gibt, auf der ich mich aufbauen kann. Das fühlte sich modern, es fühlte sich ethisch an, es fühlte sich stark an. “ Rider balancierte diese Hommage an die Vergangenheit, indem er sie mit seiner eigenen modischen Geschichte verflechtete. Es gab Anspielungen auf seine amerikanischen Wurzeln und seine jüngste Zeit als Designdirektor von Polo Ralph Lauren, mit druckvollen, gefärbten Strick-Jumpern mit V-Ausschnitt, ordentlichen Oxford-Hemden und gestreiften Krawatten. Einfacher Abend sieht schwarz aus, einschließlich eines schulterfreien Kleides und der satinrafschen Blazer schienen sich an seine frühere Zeit bei Celine auf subtile Weise zu erinnern. Zubehör, die für Luxusmarken einfacher sind als ein Mantel von 5.000 Pfund, waren ein Fokus. Die Finger der Modelle wurden mit mehreren goldenen und primären farbigen Ringen bedeckt. Klobige Armreifen wurden auf Unterarmen gestapelt. Riesenkettenverbindungsketten wurden misshandelt. Keyrings schlängten mit allem, von Würfel bis zu Miniatur -Eiffeltürmen. Rider sagte, er wolle ein Element des Spaßes einbringen. “Ich würde niemals als zynisch empfunden werden. Ein Sinn für Humor im Luxusraum ist eine schöne Sache”, sagte er. Taschen, die von kolossalen gewebten Körben und riesigen Lederbeuteln bis hin zu zierlichen Beuteln reichen, wurden mit Logos, die von einem einfachen C bis zu einem „Triomphe“ -Monogramm reichen, das 1971 vom Gründer Céline Vipiana des Hauses erstellt wurde.

mov_9209ADC110EA1B95B06BA40BC9E7FD89,"  Provocative Georgian showman Demna is to take a final bow after 10 years at Balenciaga during Paris Haute Couture Week, which begins Monday and will also feature a debut for Maison Margiela's new chief creative. Demna, known for his daring work as well as controversies during his decade-long stint at Kering-owned Balenciaga, will unveil his final collection on Wednesday in what is expected to be one of the highlights of the week. Not to be confused with Paris Fashion Week, Haute Couture Week takes place exclusively in Paris — in January for spring-summer collections and July for autumn-winter. It is a uniquely French event dedicated to handcrafted, one-of-a-kind creations made to wear at red carpets, galas, and other high-profile events. The 44-year-old Demna, acclaimed by millennials and Gen-Z stars from Kim Kardashian to British pop sensation Charli XCX, has been tasked with reviving the flagging fortunes of Gucci by Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault. After multiplying sales at Balenciaga, where he made headlines with a $2,000 ""Ikea"" bag and a $1,800 so-called ""trash pouch"", he is currently being honoured with an exhibition titled ""Balenciaga by Demna"" at Kering's Paris headquarters. He will be succeeded by Italian designer Pierpaolo Piccioli, who is set to present his first collection in October during Paris Women's Fashion Week. As usual, Schiaparelli will open Couture Week, followed later in the day by shows from Iris Van Herpen —- returning after a year-long break -— as well as Georges Hobeika, Imane Ayissi, Rahul Mishra, Julie de Libran, and Giambattista Valli. After Demna's farewell on Wednesday, Belgian designer Glenn Martens will find himself in the spotlight as he unveils a first collection for Maison Margiela following his appointment in January to succeed British designer John Galliano. American designer Michael Rider, who succeeded Hedi Slimane as chief designer at Celine, unveiled his first collection for the luxury French brand on Sunday, outside the official calendar. – Absences – On Tuesday, Chanel will present the final collection created by its in-house design studio, the fifth since Virginie Viard's sudden departure in June 2024. More in Style Her successor, the discreet and highly respected Franco-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy, was appointed in December and will showcase his first collection for Chanel in October. Up to Thursday, 27 houses will unveil their creations, including Elie Saab, Armani Prive, Aelis, Viktor&Rolf, Adeline Andre, and Dubai-based Rami Al Ali who is set to become the first Syrian to join the official calendar. Following a spate of major changes at fashion houses, some absences will stand out, particularly Dior's. After a highly anticipated debut during the men's Fashion Week on June 27, newly appointed artistic director Jonathan Anderson is holding back his first haute couture collection for January 2026. Named in early June to lead Dior's women's and couture lines as well, the 40-year-old Northern Irishman has become the first person since founder Christian Dior himself to oversee all three branches of the house. Jean Paul Gaultier is also missing. Dutch designer Duran Lantink, appointed as the brand's permanent artistic director in April, will make his debut during Women's Fashion Week in October. Since stepping back in 2020, Jean Paul Gaultier has handed over the reins of his couture collections to a series of guest designers, including Olivier Rousteing, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, Haider Ackermann, and Simone Rocha.
