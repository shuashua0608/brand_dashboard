n1bmn5o,"  I completely agree with everyone's comments. When I got the new packaging, I thought it was just cosmetic.

I can only tolerate chocolate flavored shakes, but I don't think the other flavors will be any different. I have had an Amazon subscription for isopure for a couple of years now, which I have since canceled. I'm returning my last container. My focus is carbohydrates. Isopure had a net zero carb for the chocolate flavor, which was fantastic. The closest match I have found is from GNC advanced muscle performance pure isolate chocolate lava cake. It has only two net carbs and only 15 more calories per serving, which is the best I can find so far. I did see isopure unflavored, which has zero carbs and lower calories. I haven't tried it yet.
