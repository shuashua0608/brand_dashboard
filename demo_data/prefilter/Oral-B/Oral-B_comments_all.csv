mov_4165ACB5D0CFBDD740CC0B0EC2B6ED03,"  June 30th, 2025 ( MarketersMedia News Hub  - Delivered by  Newstex ) Hurst Pediatric Dentistry (205) 969-7454) has released a comprehensive guide helping parents adequately handle children's dental crises. Birmingham, United States, June 30, 2025 -- The newly published guide outlines emergency protocols and prevention tips to help parents manage dental emergencies in children, offering practical steps for urgent oral care. Interested parties can visit  https://hurstpediatricdental.com/blog/b/children-dental-emergencies. Hurst Pediatric Dentistry's guide is intended to address growing concerns about parents' responses to sudden dental problems. The guide covers situations from knocked-out teeth to severe toothaches, offering clear instructions for immediate care. Research shows that pediatric dental emergencies make up a significant portion of all children's dental visits, with tooth pain and trauma being the most common reasons children and their parents seek urgent care. Studies indicate that about one-third of young children experience dental fear and anxiety, making parent preparedness crucial during stressful moments. Dr. Joby Hurst, the lead dentist at Hurst Pediatric Dentistry, who has treated children in Birmingham for over 25 years, says parents often struggle during dental emergencies. ""We see families arrive at our office in distress because they didn't know what steps to take at home,"" Dr. Hurst explained. ""This guide gives parents the knowledge they need to respond effectively and feel more secure in their children's dental health."" The resource includes protocols for various dental emergencies, providing parents with clear steps to take during different situations that require immediate attention. Each section focuses on helping families respond calmly and effectively while seeking professional care. Families with children who have special needs or sensory sensitivities receive additional support through modified approaches designed for children who may react strongly to unfamiliar situations. ""Children with autism or developmental delays may need different support during dental emergencies,"" Dr. Hurst noted. ""We included specific strategies to help all families feel prepared."" Prevention strategies form a significant part of the resource. The guide explains how regular dental visits, protective gear during sports, and good oral hygiene can reduce the likelihood of dental emergencies. The resource also provides recommendations for creating a home dental emergency kit. About Dr. Joby Hurst Dr. Hurst completed his residency at UAB and became a Diplomate of the American Board of Pediatric Dentistry in 2002. His practice serves infants, children, teenagers, and patients with special needs throughout Birmingham.

(Or creepy depending on how you interpret it) Anyways, I have been an Instacart shopper on and off since 2021 and I have never seen anything as perplexing as this. There is a customer in my area who orders multiple times a day and has over 2300 total orders over time. His orders and the items he orders are so consistent that I know it's him before I even accept the batch. The first time I delivered to him, it was 4 Swiffer Wet Jets and a few packs of gloves from Home Depot. I didn't really think anything of it, maybe he has a cleaning business, whatever. When I arrived at this guys house, I kid you not there were at least 20 other deliveries at his door. I would come to find out that there's always at least 20 other deliveries at his door. Craziest part is that there were FIVE OTHER SWIFFER WET JETS already on the porch!!!!!!!! I was super confused but could not come up with any sort of logical conclusion in my head. The next time I delivered to him, it was a few reams of paper and a ~$400 shark vacuum. Low and fucking behold this man has at least 10 of those exact same vacuums in his detached garage.

I don't feel comfortable enough to just ask him either. - He's one of those doomsday believers and is prepping for when the day comes: this doesn't explain the vacuums/swiffers or reams of paper really - He's reselling these items: when I saw the vacuums through the window they were all unpackaged, also none of these items have been on sale so i can't imagine he would be buying them at face value and then reselling them for more if someone could just buy it at the store - Credit card fraud: this doesn't make sense because he has been ordering multiple times a day for months, also he has had to sign for every vacuum and if that was the case theres no way they wouldn't have caught it by now.

mov_2F1BFD53466777C7D1F921761F9C71AC,"  AI appears to be a theme with a high trigger value. Understandably so; it surely challenges our belief of being the apex species on this planet. However, some time ago I wrote some lines on possible Tango futures ( Some thoughts about „Quo vadis, Tango? “), and therein, also a speculation about AI being trained to play like EdO tango orchestras (not weirder than Carsten's ""dance robots"", in my view). Also, a couple of days ago I posted a contribution in a private Facebook group (TTango DJ Forum) suggesting a thought experiment: Take a piece of music sounding like di Sarli (and with sounding, I mean, meant to have the same emotional effect), play it to people and ask them about their opinion. And then, telling them one of three stories: a) the piece is a previously lost authentic di Sarli recording; b) it is a contemporary orchestra which has found out how to play like di Sarli; c) the song has been generated by an AI which has been trained on the entire work of di Sarli. There was a lot of response, and some of that had a quite high emotional temperature. I am not going to cite specific texts because I want to respect the closed nature of that group. However, the range went from ""if it works, it is okay"" to white-hot rage about desecration of di Sarli's memory, including some rather weird extrapolations of my original thought with the probable intent to ""silence"" it that way. Perhaps I have mentioned before that I am a physicist by education. As I believe, heated debates are the essence of progress, not only in science (as long as it does not escalate into people shooting at each other, of course). Of course I am also a hedonist; a friend once said that obviously my genome contains less Chimpanzee and more Bonobo than usual. But it is the mix of both that brings us forward. Whatever. This morning I came upon a YouTube video dealing with AI generated music. https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Nlb-m_vKYM      The author uses a quite clever way to check if the music in question might be AI generated. No matter if it is or not: probably it is only a matter of time before AI-generated orchestras appear. Of course, there is the music industry, with a rather large financial firepower and ready to use it to protect their copyright interests, so it is going to be interesting; my guess is that there will be some kind of win-win construction. How about the Tango subsector? It is simply too small and financially unimportant to mobilize much in the way of resources. Impacts will probably be more in the way of collateral effects - if the state of the art is sufficiently developed, sooner or later, someone will apply it to the Tango music world. Which brings us to a second ""aspect of the AI in Tango"" debate - AI-enhanced DJing. All the experiments I know about (including my own) show that currently, Tango DJs have nothing to fear from AI. I asked ChatGPT about it: ""why is chatgpt so bad in creating tango tandas?"" And this was what I got:     Great question—and a fair critique if you've had a disappointing experience. Creating tango tandas (sets of songs played in sequence during a milonga) is notoriously nuanced, and here's why ChatGPT might not meet expectations out of the box:         Why It Struggles     Lack of Musical Context Tango DJs rely on deep musical knowledge: tempo, mood, orchestration, vocal vs. instrumental, and even the emotional arc across songs. GPT doesn't inherently ""hear"" music or feel phrasing—so it can't judge how a Troilo with Fiorentino might contrast too sharply with a later Di Sarli vocal track. Limited DJ Practice Data There's relatively little publicly available, high-quality data about how expert tango DJs build tandas. Much of the skill is oral tradition or personal experience, not documented online in a way GPT can learn from well. Lack of Local/Regional Awareness Milonga culture varies wildly—Buenos Aires vs. Berlin vs. Tokyo. What feels “perfect” in one setting might fall flat elsewhere. GPT doesn't know your crowd unless you tell it. Balance Issues A good tanda isn't just four good songs—it's a balanced emotional and rhythmic journey. GPT might throw together four Pugliese instrumentals and call it a day, but that's a recipe for a heart attack on the dance floor. How to Get Better Results     You can absolutely use GPT to help build tandas, but you'll want to:     Specify the orchestra, era, singer, and energy Example: ""Build a 4-song tanda of early 1940s rhythmic D'Agostino with Vargas, ending on a strong emotional finish."" State the type of milonga or crowd E.g., ""This is for a relaxed afternoon milonga for intermediate dancers in Berlin."" Ask for alternatives or reasons ""Why does this tanda work emotionally?"" or ""Give me a calmer alternative for the 3rd track."" Cross-check the flow Listen to the selections yourself or run them by a human DJ. Think of GPT as your assistant, not the DJ. So there are some hints - such as providing suitable metrics to characterize music from their emotional effect. Of course, if we assume that sooner or later AI will be able to detect this by actually analyzing the audio signal, this will not be necessary anymore. The really interesting part here is, however, something different. It is useful to have a sort of ""game theory""-wise look at it. Clearly, it would benefit the Tango world as a whole if every milonga is providing the best possible musical and therefore emotional experience to dancers. It would keep dancers inside the community, they would radiate their pleasure, thereby helping to attract new dancers - in short, the better the milongas, the more benefit for the entire Tango ecosphere. Obviously, Tango DJs come in different flavors and quality levels. Organizers should have an interest to select the best ones; they are, however, in short supply. From the viewpoint of a good TDJ, sharing his know-how is probably not the best strategy. It may increase his status inside the community, but also is likely to hurt his commercial interests by lowering his uniqueness....","AI appears to be a theme with a high trigger value.

mov_6F274FA6C46AE17DD25D017F9ACB65E5,"  Immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed the management of patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, by leading to long-term response and prolongation of survival in a subset of patients. Unfortunately, only one in five patients with metastatic urothelial cancer responds to anti-programmed death ligand-1 ([AQ1]anti-PD-1) monotherapy. Preclinical and early clinical evidence indicates that radiotherapy not only acts locally, but also exerts systemic anti-tumour effects by modulating the immune system. It is hypothesised that combining checkpoint inhibitors with radiotherapy might enhance an anti-tumour immune response and increase response rates. So far, a handful of early phase clinical trials have been performed seeking to answer this question in urothelial cancer patients. The current review summarises the available preclinical and clinical evidence on radiotherapy/immunotherapy combinations in locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer and suggests future avenues worthy of exploration.Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the most prevalent cause of acquired paralytic neuropathy in children, however, ataxia as the initial presenting sign in children is very rare. Antiganglioside antibodies are presumed to have an important role in the pathophysiology and some phenotypic correlations have been reported. Anti-GM2 antibody, unlike other antibodies, is far less detected in GBS. Here, we report a 7.5-year-old female, initially presenting with ataxia, an atypical presenting symptom in a child, is promptly diagnosed and treated successfully as GBS. Atypical history of urinary infection in our patient is an interesting aspect. The presence of isolated anti-GM2 IgM antibody and ataxia in a pediatric patient is rare. In this case report, we aim to describe an atypical initial presentation, with positive anti-GM2 antibodies, as well as review literature on isolated anti-GM2 positive pediatric GBS patients.This review is intended to highlight some of the historic events that contributed to the development of thoracic and cardiac anesthesia and surgery in Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK). The aim of this first of two parts is to concentrate on the development of techniques, facilities, and pharmacology that allowed progress and advancement in patient management that were developed primarily in the UK. However, progress usually requires input from a wide variety of sources of knowledge, and cardiothoracic practice is no exception. Reference is, thus, made to sources outside of the UK that guided, influenced, or inspired changes in practice, such as the techniques of operating on the heart and great vessels in war casualties, developed by Dr. Dwight Harken, or the demonstration of the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt by Alfred Blalock. In addition to advances in medical equipment, such as computed tomography, the UK contributed greatly to pharmacologic interventions that were unique at the time in such varied areas as nonflammable volatile anesthetic agents, heart failure treatments, and neuromuscular blocking agents for both cardiac and thoracic surgical practice.The use and evolution of oral anticoagulation therapies continue to advance for multiple reasons, including a growing segment of older patients with associated chronic prothrombotic illnesses including cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and oncologic conditions. Correlated to this increased use of oral anticoagulants is bleeding complications associated with their use. Based on these trends, it is expected that perioperative physicians will be facing more and more of these patients requiring scheduled, urgent or emergent surgical procedures During May 2020, the American College of Cardiology updated its Expert Consensus Decision Pathway devoted to the approach of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants. This updated version emphasized the expanding role of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants in other conditions beyond nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, such as venous thromboembolism. Several details discussed within this most recent update are pertinent to perioperative physicians, who frequently deal with bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation. The purpose of this narrative review is to highlight and expand on these salient points because they relate to perioperative management. For kidney transplant patients, incisional hernia (IH) is a major complication resulting from prolonged pretransplant dialysis, immunosuppressive drugs, and the high prevalence of diabetes. However, there have been relatively few studies of IH after kidney transplantation (KT) in Japan and in the greater Asian population. Additionally, operative methods for IH repair have not been established. We retrospectively analyzed 465 consecutive patients who underwent KT at our hospital from April 2013 to March 2019. Patients who underwent incisional hernia repair were included in this study, and the follow-up time was extended to September 2020. check details We defined severe IH as an IH requiring surgical repair. We examine the risk factors for severe IH among KT patients and also discuss the operative methods of IH repair. During the study period, 7 patients developed severe IH after KT. The cumulative occurrence rate for severe IH was 1.1% 1 year postoperatively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that age at KT and dialysis duration (hazard ratio=1.112, P=.016; hazard ratio=1.106, respectively; P=.038) were independent risk factors for severe IH. We used polypropylene mesh for IH repair in all cases, with onlay repair performed in 5 of 7 cases. There was no recurrence or infection after mesh repair during follow-up. In this study, age at KT and dialysis duration were independent risk factors for severe IH in the Japanese population. Onlay repair with a polypropylene mesh appeared to be a safe and acceptable operation for IH repair after KT. In this study, age at KT and dialysis duration were independent risk factors for severe IH in the Japanese population. Onlay repair with a polypropylene mesh appeared to be a safe and acceptable operation for IH repair after KT.Generic dose-volume constraints of the rectum/bladder (R/B) are used in inverse planning to reduce doses to these organs for patients undergoing prostate radiotherapy. A retrospective study was undertaken to assess correlations between the overlap of the R/B with the planning target volume (PTV) and the dose received during planning to organs at risk (OARs). Data for 105 prostate cancer patients who had volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to the intact prostate and proximal seminal vesicles at Nepean Cancer Care Centre from 2011 to 2015 were analyzed. R/B volume, R/B-PTV overlap volume, and R/B-PTV overlap percent metrics were collected with VMAT planning objectives. Characteristics were evaluated for correlation with different planning outcomes. The percentage overlap between the R/B and PTV were highly correlated to the doses to the relevant OAR, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.63 for the rectum volume percentage receiving more than 75 Gy (RV75Gy) and R2 of 0.91 for the bladder volume percentage receiving more than 70 Gy (BV70Gy).","Immune checkpoint inhibitors have transformed the management of patients with metastatic urothelial cancer, by leading to long-term response and prolongation of survival in a subset of patients.

The current review summarises the available preclinical and clinical evidence on radiotherapy/immunotherapy combinations in locally advanced and metastatic bladder cancer and suggests future avenues worthy of exploration.Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is the most prevalent cause of acquired paralytic neuropathy in children, however, ataxia as the initial presenting sign in children is very rare. Antiganglioside antibodies are presumed to have an important role in the pathophysiology and some phenotypic correlations have been reported. Anti-GM2 antibody, unlike other antibodies, is far less detected in GBS. Here, we report a 7.5-year-old female, initially presenting with ataxia, an atypical presenting symptom in a child, is promptly diagnosed and treated successfully as GBS. Atypical history of urinary infection in our patient is an interesting aspect. The presence of isolated anti-GM2 IgM antibody and ataxia in a pediatric patient is rare. In this case report, we aim to describe an atypical initial presentation, with positive anti-GM2 antibodies, as well as review literature on isolated anti-GM2 positive pediatric GBS patients.This review is intended to highlight some of the historic events that contributed to the development of thoracic and cardiac anesthesia and surgery in Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK). The aim of this first of two parts is to concentrate on the development of techniques, facilities, and pharmacology that allowed progress and advancement in patient management that were developed primarily in the UK. However, progress usually requires input from a wide variety of sources of knowledge, and cardiothoracic practice is no exception. Reference is, thus, made to sources outside of the UK that guided, influenced, or inspired changes in practice, such as the techniques of operating on the heart and great vessels in war casualties, developed by Dr. Dwight Harken, or the demonstration of the Blalock-Thomas-Taussig shunt by Alfred Blalock. In addition to advances in medical equipment, such as computed tomography, the UK contributed greatly to pharmacologic interventions that were unique at the time in such varied areas as nonflammable volatile anesthetic agents, heart failure treatments, and neuromuscular blocking agents for both cardiac and thoracic surgical practice.The use and evolution of oral anticoagulation therapies continue to advance for multiple reasons, including a growing segment of older patients with associated chronic prothrombotic illnesses including cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic and oncologic conditions. Correlated to this increased use of oral anticoagulants is bleeding complications associated with their use. Based on these trends, it is expected that perioperative physicians will be facing more and more of these patients requiring scheduled, urgent or emergent surgical procedures During May 2020, the American College of Cardiology updated its Expert Consensus Decision Pathway devoted to the approach of bleeding in patients on oral anticoagulants. This updated version emphasized the expanding role of the direct-acting oral anticoagulants in other conditions beyond nonvalvular atrial fibrillation, such as venous thromboembolism. Several details discussed within this most recent update are pertinent to perioperative physicians, who frequently deal with bleeding in the setting of anticoagulation. The purpose of this narrative review is to highlight and expand on these salient points because they relate to perioperative management. For kidney transplant patients, incisional hernia (IH) is a major complication resulting from prolonged pretransplant dialysis, immunosuppressive drugs, and the high prevalence of diabetes. However, there have been relatively few studies of IH after kidney transplantation (KT) in Japan and in the greater Asian population. Additionally, operative methods for IH repair have not been established. We retrospectively analyzed 465 consecutive patients who underwent KT at our hospital from April 2013 to March 2019. Patients who underwent incisional hernia repair were included in this study, and the follow-up time was extended to September 2020. check details We defined severe IH as an IH requiring surgical repair. We examine the risk factors for severe IH among KT patients and also discuss the operative methods of IH repair. During the study period, 7 patients developed severe IH after KT. The cumulative occurrence rate for severe IH was 1.1% 1 year postoperatively. Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that age at KT and dialysis duration (hazard ratio=1.112, P=.016; hazard ratio=1.106, respectively; P=.038) were independent risk factors for severe IH. We used polypropylene mesh for IH repair in all cases, with onlay repair performed in 5 of 7 cases. There was no recurrence or infection after mesh repair during follow-up. In this study, age at KT and dialysis duration were independent risk factors for severe IH in the Japanese population. Onlay repair with a polypropylene mesh appeared to be a safe and acceptable operation for IH repair after KT. In this study, age at KT and dialysis duration were independent risk factors for severe IH in the Japanese population. Onlay repair with a polypropylene mesh appeared to be a safe and acceptable operation for IH repair after KT.Generic dose-volume constraints of the rectum/bladder (R/B) are used in inverse planning to reduce doses to these organs for patients undergoing prostate radiotherapy. A retrospective study was undertaken to assess correlations between the overlap of the R/B with the planning target volume (PTV) and the dose received during planning to organs at risk (OARs). Data for 105 prostate cancer patients who had volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) to the intact prostate and proximal seminal vesicles at Nepean Cancer Care Centre from 2011 to 2015 were analyzed. R/B volume, R/B-PTV overlap volume, and R/B-PTV overlap percent metrics were collected with VMAT planning objectives. Characteristics were evaluated for correlation with different planning outcomes. The percentage overlap between the R/B and PTV were highly correlated to the doses to the relevant OAR, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.63 for the rectum volume percentage receiving more than 75 Gy (RV75Gy) and R2 of 0.91 for the bladder volume percentage receiving more than 70 Gy (BV70Gy).",2025-07-01 08:54:02,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The provided text appears to be a collection of medical research abstracts covering topics like cancer treatment, Guillain-Barré syndrome, anticoagulation therapy, and kidney transplantation.

The review was carried out in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A total of 365 articles were found in the main scientific databases. Applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 11 studies were admitted to the final phase of the review. Three different rehabilitative approaches were identified physical training, respiratory training, and balance training. All rehabilitative modalities contributed to enhancing functional outcomes, reducing fatigue, and improving quality of life, but currently none can be recommended over another for the lack of cross-comparative studies. The included studies showed methodological quality from low to fair. Despite the range of rehabilitative interventions available, there is a lack of high-quality evidence. However, this review suggests that a multidisciplinary rehabilitation approach should be recommended to people with myasthenia gravis, and above all, for those with mild to moderate symptomatology.One of the main goals of diabetic therapy is to achieve the best metabolic control to prevent the development and progression of potential complications. A multidisciplinary approach characterized by the combination of diet, physical activity (PA) and drug therapy with oral and injectable (non-insulin) pharmacological agents, is desirable to optimize metabolic control. The aim of this review is to explain the contribution of PA and its beneficial effects on patients affected by type 1 (T1D) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). We provide an overview of evidence on the effects of PA for the main two types of diabetes mellitus (DM) to identify the right level of PA to be recommended. We discuss the physiological and clinical role of PA in people with DM. It can be concluded that the objective of antidiabetic therapy should be the achievement and optimization of metabolic control through a multidisciplinary approach involving non-pharmacological therapy such as diet and PA, which has a crucial role.The ongoing Coronavirus 2 (COVID-19) pandemic abruptly halted athletic competition and standard training practices, consequently generating great confusion surrounding when and how to safely reintroduce sports. Therefore, tangible solutions disseminated to performance staff, coaches, and athletes are warranted to ensure optimal levels of health and physical performance for all personnel during both the current social distancing standards as well as the impending return of competition despite continued risks. In this commentary, we offer strategies for utilizing technology and data tools as components of longitudinal COVID-19 surveillance based on ongoing research efforts as well as current guidance from governing bodies, while also serving the performance needs of the athletes and staff. Recommended data sources include digital symptom and well-being surveys, standardized and routine physical performance testing, sleep and sleep physiology monitoring, cognitive applications, and temperature. This system is flexible to numerous commercially available products and is designed for easy implementation that permits instant feedback provided directly to the athlete as well as their support staff for early intervention, ultimately mitigating COVID-19 risks. We will discuss multiple options, including examples of data, data visualizations and recommendations for data interpretation and communication.In this editorial, we focus on recent problematic developments in sport science, and more specifically, problems related to periodization research. Primary areas discussed are (1) appreciation of history, (2) considerations for training studies, (3) the development of concepts, and (4) programming-driven training models.This study aimed to investigate the effect of dehydration on archery performance, subjective feelings and heart rate response. Ten national level archers performed two archery competition simulations, once under euhydration (EUH) and once in a dehydrated state (DEH), induced by 24-h reduced fluid intake. Hydration status was verified prior to each trial by urine specific gravity (USG ≥ 1.025). Archery score was measured according to official archery regulations. Subjective feelings of thirst, fatigue and concentration were recorded on a visual analogue scale. Heart rate was continuously monitored during the trials. Archery performance was similar between trials (p = 0.155). During DEH trial (USG 1.032 ± 0.005), the athletes felt thirstier (p less then 0.001), more fatigued (p = 0.041) and less able to concentrate (p = 0.016) compared with the EUH trial (USG 1.015 ± 0.004). Heart rate during DEH at baseline (85 ± 5 b∙min-1) was higher (p = 0.021) compared with EUH (78 ± 6 b∙min-1) and remained significantly higher during the latter stages of the DEH compared to EUH trial. In conclusion, archery performance over 72 arrows was not affected by dehydration, despite the induced psychological and physiological strain, revealed from decreased feeling of concentration, increased sensation of fatigue and increased heart rate during the DEH trial.Long-term heavy physical work often leads to early retirement and disability pension due to chronic overload, with a need to define upper limits. The aim of this study was to evaluate the value of the first lactate threshold (LTP1) as a physiological marker for heavy occupational work. A total of 188 male and 52 female workers performed an incremental cycle ergometer test to determine maximal exercise performance and the first and second lactate (LTP1; LTP2) and ventilatory thresholds (VT1; VT2). Heart rate (HR) recordings were obtained during one eight-hour shift (HR8h) and oxygen uptake was measured during 20 minutes of a representative work phase. Energy expenditure (EE) was calculated from gas-exchange measures. Maximal power output (Pmax), maximal oxygen consumption (VO2 max) and power output at LTP1 and LTP2 were significantly different between male and female workers. HR8h was not significantly different between male and female workers. A significant relationship was found between Pmax and power output at LTP1.","These results can help interdisciplinary athlete care teams optimize training programs in this population by understanding what changes are expected over multiple years.

mov_B5E47729D623A012C12A295ACCAC3A23,"  Abstract Background: Patients with liver cirrhosis undergoing splenectomy exhibit a high incidence of portal venous system thrombosis (PVST). Therapeutic interventions may prevent PVST development. This Bayesian network meta-analysis systematically evaluates the efficacy and safety of diverse anticoagulation regimens for PVST prophylaxis. Methods: In accordance with the PRISMA-NMA statement and PRISMA 2020 guidelines, we systematically searched PubMed, Cochrane Library, and other databases from their inception to March 1, 2025, for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) investigating interventions to prevent PVST after splenectomy in cirrhotic patients. Artificial intelligence-assisted screening was conducted using the AS Review tool. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was performed to synthesize preventive effect estimates across interventions. Results: Initial database searches identified 636 records, with 6 RCTs (557 patients) meeting inclusion criteria. Five interventions were evaluated, with the primary outcome being PVST incidence and secondary outcomes including main portal vein thrombosis (MPVT) and splenic vein thrombosis (SVT). Analyses demonstrated that direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), specifically apixaban, demonstrated superior efficacy in reducing PVST, MPVT, and SVT rates at postoperative time points (7 days, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months). However, the certainty of evidence for this conclusion was rated as low. In contrast, the evidence certainty for low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) combined with warfarin was assessed as moderate. Conclusions: Current evidence indicates that for Child-Pugh class A/B cirrhosis patients undergoing splenectomy, the combination of LMWH and warfarin should be considered as the first-line anticoagulation strategy for PVST. While existing evidence remains insufficient to elevate DOACs, particularly apixaban, to a higher prioritization level, they demonstrate promising therapeutic potential.

mov_AB17E18ACEA1293BC625C399FBFE53E6,"  Recent Supreme Court decisions underscore how viewpoint-based refusals of trademark applications are unconstitutional. But can these viewpoint-based refusals survive under the ""failure-to-function"" doctrine instead? Background: ­­­­Supreme Court Struck Down Bar on Registration of ""Disparaging,"" ""Immoral,"" and ""Scandalous"" Marks Eight years ago, in Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744 (2017), the United States Supreme Court struck down the Lanham Act's bar on registering trademarks that ""disparage"" persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols. The Court's decision in Tam was in response to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)'s refusal to register an Asian American band's name, ""THE SLANTS."" There, the Court held that: (1) viewpoint-based trademark restrictions are unconstitutional under the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause; and (2) the disparagement clause was viewpoint-based and, therefore, unconstitutional. Two years later, in Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388 (2019), the Supreme Court heard Erik Brunetti's challenge to a neighboring provision of the Lanham Act: the ban on registering ""immoral or scandalous"" marks. In that case, Brunetti sought to register the name of his clothing brand ""F-U-C-T."" While pronounced as four discrete letters, the government alleged that the applied-for mark was ""the equivalent of the . . . past participle form of a well-known"" obscenity. There, the Court held that the bar on registering ""immoral or scandalous"" trademarks constituted viewpoint discrimination and was, consequently, a violation of the First Amendment. The USPTO Subsequently Invoked the ""Failure-to-Function"" Doctrine as a Basis for Refusing Brunetti's Applications for ""F***"" In addition to his application for the mark ""FUCT,"" Erik Brunetti filed four intent-to-use applications for the mark ""F***"" (spelled and pronounced as the present tense form of FUCT) in connection with various consumer goods and associated retail store services. While Brunetti's application for the mark ""FUCT"" was pending before the Supreme Court in Iancu v. Brunetti, his concurrent intent-to-use applications for F*** were suspended by the examining attorney assigned to review the applications. Upon resolution of Brunetti, the USPTO examining attorney re-examined the applications and subsequently refused registration based on a conclusion that the applied-for mark ""fails to function"" as a trademark. Notably, this basis for refusal was not raised until after the Court's Brunetti decision, striking the ""immoral or scandalous"" basis of refusal as impermissibly viewpoint-based. The Examiner Found That the Applied-For Mark is ""Commonly Used"" and Thus Less Likely to be Perceived as a Source Identifier In support of the foregoing ""failure-to-function"" refusals, the examining attorney offered evidence in the form of articles and dictionary definitions, which, according to the examiner, ""illustrates that the term is commonly used as a versatile expression conveying a wide range of emotion, from disdain to joy."" See Examiner's Brief Filed with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board at p. 12, available here. The examining attorney argued that ""[b]ecause consumers are accustomed to seeing this term or expression commonly used in everyday speech by many different sources, they would not perceive the use of the term as a mark identifying the source of Applicant's goods and/or services but rather as only conveying an informational message or sentiment."" The Examiner Relied on Evidence Showing Ornamental Use of the Applied-For Mark The examiner also sought out and relied upon evidence from third-party sources such as Amazon and Etsy to show the word ""F***"" used in a decorative or ornamental fashion on several of the goods listed in Brunetti's applications, including phone cases, jewelry, wallets, and tote bags. The examiner explained such evidence ""illustrates that many competitors use the term as an informational message on jewelry, bags, phone cases, and many other items"" and that ""[t]o allow the Applicant to appropriate the term for its proposed goods and services would prevent competitors from using the commonplace term to promote their own goods and services."" The Refusal Survived Appeal The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB or Board) upheld the examiner's refusal of the marks based on a failure to function. In doing so, the Board found that the evidence of record establishes that the applied-for word ""F***"" expresses well-recognized familiar sentiments and that relevant consumers are accustomed to seeing the word in widespread use on the types of goods identified in Brunetti's applications. Accordingly, the Board concluded that the word ""F***"" does not function as a trademark distinguishing Brunetti's goods and services in commerce. Brunetti Asserted ""Failure-to-Function"" is a ""Novel"" Doctrine Used to Circumvent Bans on Viewpoint-Based Refusals In response to the Board's decision, Brunetti asserted that failure-to-function is an ""invalid"" substantive refusal lacking statutory basis. Brunetti accused the USPTO of weaponizing a procedural doctrine to ""evade the Supreme Court's decisions"" in Tam and Brunetti, thereby creating a new backdoor substantive doctrine. Under this well-established procedural doctrine, if a submitted specimen ""demonstrates merely ornamental use"" of an applied-for mark, then the USPTO can issue a refusal of the mark for failing to function as a trademark. In his briefings, Brunetti argued that the USPTO has since expanded this procedural refusal to create a ""novel, substantive doctrine"" under which some words can never be registered. He noted that ""it was not a coincidence"" that these same words ""would have been refused under Section 2(a) prior to Tam and Brunetti."" In addition to asserting that the new failure-to-function doctrine was invalid, Brunetti contended that it lacked consistent standards and contradicted ""fundamental principles of trademark law."" Brunetti alleged that the refusals of his applications were ""predetermined,"" as evidenced by the USPTO's continuous ""discovery of new grounds."" Illustrating this point, Brunetti pointed to the justifications offered by the USPTO for why ""F***"" could not be registered and explained how the evidence did not support their rationale. Brunetti submitted that all of the USPTO's evidence of ""use"" was ornamental, which cannot ""preclude a term from being perceived as a trademark."" On the contrary, Brunetti pointed to examples of other ""widely used"" words and phrases that are registered: ""LOVE,"" ""APPLE,"" and ""DELTA."" Consequently, Brunetti argued that if the USPTO's approach was correct, these words should also be unregistrable. Federal Circuit Expressed Skepticism During Oral Arguments On March 10, 2025, a panel of Federal Circuit judges heard oral arguments on behalf of Mr. Brunetti and the USPTO. During oral arguments, the court questioned how the USPTO could judge how a mark would be perceived by consumers, where, as here, the mark is not yet being used by the applicant in connection with its goods and services. Notably, in its briefing, the USPTO criticized Brunetti for failing to present evidence that consumers would perceive the word ""F***"" as a source identifier. However, when asked during oral arguments what type of evidence Brunetti was supposed to present to show consumer perception, the attorney for the USPTO failed to provide any examples. Instead, the USPTO's attorney opined that ""it would probably be difficult given the nature of this particular proposed mark in the classes for which [Brunetti] has applied for it, to demonstrate that consumers are going to understand it as, as a trademark.""

mov_3AF3BDABEB443A6BDB2AB0F48BABD476,"  BOISE, Idaho, July 01, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Idaho Power Company (Idaho Power), a wholly owned subsidiary of IDACORP, Inc. (NYSE: IDA), has released its latest long-range energy plan, which forecasts unprecedented growth in energy demand and lays out the preferred options for serving customers. The 2025 Integrated Resource Plan was filed with state regulators Friday. It shows that the company needs to add significant energy resources, transmission, battery storage, and energy efficiency. The public utility commissions in Idaho and Oregon will set a schedule for public review and comment before deciding to acknowledge the plan. ""The IRP is a really detailed analysis of how we are going to continue serving our customers with safe, reliable, affordable energy in a responsible way,"" said Idaho Power Resource Planning Leader Jared Hansen, who oversees the IRP process. The utility's preferred portfolio of resources focuses on least-cost and reliability-enhancing generation and transmission projects with an eye toward further reducing wildfire risk. Growth continues to be driven by increases in population as well as a broad range of commercial and industrial expansion and development across the company's service area. Although new large-demand customers are required to pay for their own costs of interconnecting to the company's system to receive electric service, the company still must plan how best to provide that service while continuing to maintain and improve the electrical grid. ""Our plan really highlights the work we are doing to identify resources that will provide safe, reliable energy for our customers at the lowest cost over the long term,"" said Mitch Colburn, Idaho Power Vice President of Planning, Engineering, and Construction. ""We look at a wide range of potential resources that will serve all of our customers well into the future."" Over the next 20 years, the company's peak demand is expected to grow nearly 45% or 1,700 megawatts (MW), with nearly 1,000 MW of that total coming in the next five years. That 5-year increase in demand is nearly 50% more than the capacity of the company's single largest energy source, the Brownlee hydropower plant. The IRP also highlights the need for more transmission line infrastructure, specifically the Boardman to Hemingway and Southwest Intertie projects, which are 500-kilovolt lines that will enable the company to import energy when customer demand for electricity is high. Idaho Power enlists the assistance of its customers in developing the IRP through an advisory panel — the Integrated Resource Plan Advisory Council (IRPAC). The IRPAC includes major industrial customers, the environmental community, irrigation representatives, state and local elected officials, public utility commission representatives, and other interested parties. The IRP is available at idahopower.com/irp. Background Information IDACORP, Inc. (NYSE: IDA), Boise, Idaho-based and formed in 1998, is a holding company comprised of Idaho Power, a regulated electric utility; IDACORP Financial, an investor in affordable housing and other real estate tax credit investments; and Ida-West Energy, an operator of small hydroelectric generation projects that satisfy the requirements of the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978.

En conjunto, los tribunales han puesto en evidencia la magnitud de la trama: más de 150 cargos públicos del PP están implicados en estos sumarios. Entre ellos figuran ex altos cargos populares como el expresidente Mariano Rajoy (implicado en la llamada Operación Cataluña), el exvicepresidente Rodrigo Rato, la exministra Ana Mato, el exministro de Interior Jorge Fernández Díaz, el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana y varios líderes regionales, como el expresidente murciano Pedro Antonio Sánchez o el exmandatario de Murcia Ramón Luis Valcárcel. La cuantía de las penas solicitadas es enorme: por ejemplo, la Fiscalía pide décadas de cárcel para Rato por fraudes económicos. Calendario judicial de las macrocausas pendientes El calendario judicial de estos procesos se extiende a lo largo de varios años. Entre los hitos ya conocidos destacan: Caso Rato (Audiencia Provincial de Madrid): El exministro Rodrigo Rato fue juzgado entre diciembre de 2023 y mayo de 2024 por delitos fiscales (caso Bankia) y uso indebido de tarjetas (tarjetas Black). Cumplió condena por estas tarjetas y tiene pendiente un juicio por un presunto fraude en la salida a bolsa de Bankia. Caso Erial (Audiencia Provincial de Valencia): En octubre de 2024 se dictó sentencia no firme contra el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana, condenado a 10 años y 5 meses de prisión por blanqueo, cohecho, falsedad documental y prevaricación en la adjudicación de estaciones de ITV (pelotazo de las ITV). Aún puede recurrirse este fallo ante el Tribunal Supremo. Operación Púnica (Audiencia Nacional, Madrid): La pieza principal del caso –el supuesto amaño de contratos de eficiencia energética a la empresa Cofely– tiene fecha de juicio: la vista oral empezará el 7 de abril de 2025 y durará hasta mayo. Se sentarán 37 acusados en el banquillo, incluidos nueve exalcaldes (siete del PP) de Madrid y Extremadura, por la adjudicación irregular de contratos municipales de más de 224 millones de euros. Además de esta pieza, otras diez piezas separadas de Púnica siguen pendientes de juicio. Operación Kitchen (Audiencia Nacional): El tribunal fijó el juicio para mayo-junio de 2026. En este caso se enjuiciará a los exministros del Interior Jorge Fernández Díaz y Francisco Martínez, así como a varios comisarios de Policía por la trama policial ilegal montada en 2013 para espiar al extesorero Luis Bárcenas. La Fiscalía solicita 15 años de cárcel para Fernández Díaz y Martínez. Caso Novo Carthago (Murcia): El proceso por la urbanización ilegal de Novo Carthago, en el que están imputados exconsejeros murcianos, sufrió un aplazamiento judicial. Debido a una huelga de letrados se ha pospuesto la vista oral hasta 2025. Caso Campus de la Justicia (Audiencia Nacional): En septiembre de 2024 la Audiencia Nacional condenó a 7 años de prisión a Alfredo Prada, exconsejero de Justicia de la Comunidad de Madrid en el Gobierno de Esperanza Aguirre, por prevaricación y malversación en contratos amañados del proyecto del Campus Judicial. Cuatro exdirectivos del proyecto recibieron penas menores (3,5 años). Caso Desaladora de Escombreras (Audiencia Provincial de Murcia): El expresidente murciano Ramón Luis Valcárcel enfrenta en julio de 2024 una vista de conformidad que podría evitar el juicio oral. Se le investiga por presuntos delitos de malversación, prevaricación y fraude en la construcción y rescate de la desaladora de Escombreras. La fiscalía pide 11 años de cárcel y fuertes inhabilitaciones. La jueza instructora ordenó en 2023 juicio oral contra Valcárcel tras advertir indicios de delito. Caso Gürtel: Varias piezas de esta trama originada hace años siguen su curso. Por ejemplo, en la pieza 5 (pelotazo Orange Market de los contratos de la Generalitat Valenciana) están pendientes sentencias próximas contra figuras como Francisco Camps. Asimismo, el Supremo debe resolver recursos contra la sentencia de la denominada caja B del PP, que condenó al extesorero Bárcenas. En la Comunidad de Madrid hay otra caja B investigada en una pieza separada del caso Púnica. En conjunto, quedan al menos cuatro causas Gürtel pendientes en distintas fases. Otros casos pendientes: El caso Lezo (gestión de Canal Isabel II) mantiene varias piezas con exconsejeros procesados, aunque aún no se ha fijado fecha de juicio definitiva. También continúan las investigaciones por las irregularidades en las cajas de ahorros (casos Caja B y Bankia) y el rescate de las autopistas radiales, con procesos judiciales abiertos donde el PP figura como responsable civil. Los magistrados Enrique López y Concepción Espejel han sido apartados de varios tribunales debido a sus acusados vínculos con el PP. Estos jueces, que llegaron a ser elegidos con el apoyo popular, habían sido recusados por la Fiscalía y la acusación popular por su “afinidad” al partido. El caso más reciente fue su relevo en el juicio de la financiación ilegal (caja B) del PP. Este tipo de recusaciones ha alimentado críticas de que existe una “instrumentalización de la justicia” con motivaciones políticas. Incluso el presidente Pedro Sánchez denunció públicamente casos de “lawfare” (uso político de la justicia), citando la Operación Kitchen como ejemplo de persecución política contra el PP. Voces de la oposición recalcan que estas estrategias minan la imparcialidad y exigen garantías de neutralidad en los tribunales. En conclusión, la intensa actividad judicial ha convertido al PP de Feijóo en la formación política con más procesos abiertos por corrupción en España. Los 28 juicios por corrupción del PP previstos hasta 2029 marcarán la agenda política y judicial. El partido lo atribuye a casos del pasado anteriores a la actual dirección, mientras sus críticos lo interpretan como la mayor constelación de casos de corrupción en la historia reciente del país.

OG-6219 is an oral 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 (HSD17B1) inhibitor, which Organon acquired through its acquisition of Forendo Pharma in 2021. In the study, OG-6219 did not demonstrate improvement in moderate-to-severe endometriosis-related overall pelvic pain compared to placebo. Based on these results, the company plans to discontinue the OG-6219 clinical development program.

The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, global multi-center Phase 2a/b study (NCT05560646) aimed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of three dose levels of OG-6219 in pre-menopausal women 18 to 49 years of age who have been surgically diagnosed with endometriosis with moderate-to-severe endometriosis-related pain. Eligible patients were randomized to receive one of three doses of OG-6219 or placebo orally twice a day.

mov_B828C765DEC4257958B242D0A75DE4BE,"  The bill was read a first time in the House of Commons on June 20 and is scheduled for second reading at the next sitting of the House. Editor's Note: This story was first published by The B. C. Catholic and is reprinted here with permission. Canadian member of Parliament (MP) from Cloverdale-Langley City in British Columbia, Tamara Jansen, has introduced a private member's bill to stop the expansion of medical assistance in dying (MAID) for mental illness alone. Jansen's Bill C-218 would amend the criminal code to prevent mental disorders from being considered a “grievous and irremediable medical condition” for the purposes of MAID. The bill was read a first time in the House of Commons on June 20 and is scheduled for second reading at the next sitting of the House. Speaking in the House, Jansen said: “Imagine your son or daughter battling depression for some time, after losing a job or maybe a broken relationship. Imagine they feel the loss so deep that they're convinced the world would be better off without them.” Starting March 27, 2027, such Canadians “could walk into a doctor's office and ask them to end their life,” she said. “That's not a future scenario, that's the law right now waiting to take effect.” The Justin Trudeau government delayed expansion until 2024 and again until March 17, 2027, over concerns from medical and legal experts. “Clinical experts have warned that there's no evidence-based way to determine if someone with a mental illness would get better, and most do,” Jansen said. “But still the government is moving forward.” Jansen said the proposed law sends a message to “struggling Canadians, trauma survivors, those battling depression, schizophrenia, PTSD” that “death is a solution we're now willing to offer” in response to suffering. “That's not health care. That's not compassion. It's abandonment.” She told MPs: “Mental illness is treatable. Recovery is possible, but only if we show up and help.” Jansen's bill is similar to 2023 legislation that was narrowly defeated in Parliament but delayed implementation of the federal law. Conservative MP Ed Fast of Abbotsford, British Columbia, introduced Bill C-314, which would have stopped the expansion of Canada's euthanasia regime. It was defeated at second reading on Oct. 18, 2023, by a 167-150 vote. Fast gathered cross-party support for his legislation, with all 24 New Democratic Party (NDP) members voting in favor of his bill and eight members of the Liberal Party breaking ranks from their colleagues. The Bloc Québécois held the balance of power on the vote, as each of its members voted against the Abbotsford, British Columbia, representative's endeavor. During the oral question period preceding the vote, Fast condemned reports “of Canadians crying out for help and being offered assisted suicide instead.” He attacked “the sorry state of our mental health system,” saying: “Millions of Canadians oppose the government's fascination with assisted death.” A Christian political advocacy group praised Jansen's bill and called on MPs to support it regardless of party. “Canada can never be ready to offer MAID for mental illness,” said Daniel Zekveld, a policy analyst with the Association for Reformed Political Action Canada. “Doing so would undermine suicide prevention efforts and mental health care. Canada cannot promote suicide prevention while at the same time offering suicide assistance as a solution for mental illness.” Zekveld said: “Since Parliament's last delay of the mental illness expansion, we've seen more stories of people who are suffering and unable to access necessary supports and care being offered MAID.” Offering euthanasia to people for mental illness implies “there is no hope of recovery and normalizes suicide as a solution for suffering,” Zekveld said. “But psychiatrists tell us they cannot reliably diagnose mental illness as irremediable. Canadians with mental illness need hope and support, not euthanasia or assisted suicide.” Alex Schadenberg of the Euthanasia Prevention Coalition said if Bill C-218 is to pass, politicians need to hear from Canadians. He is asking people to send their mental health stories and share what would have happened had MAID been available at the time.

Editor's Note: This story was first published by The B. C. Catholic and is reprinted here with permission. Canadian member of Parliament (MP) from Cloverdale-Langley City in British Columbia, Tamara Jansen, has introduced a private member's bill to stop the expansion of medical assistance in dying (MAID) for mental illness alone. Jansen's Bill C-218 would amend the criminal code to prevent mental disorders from being considered a “grievous and irremediable medical condition” for the purposes of MAID. The bill was read a first time in the House of Commons on June 20 and is scheduled for second reading at the next sitting of the House. Speaking in the House, Jansen said: “Imagine your son or daughter battling depression for some time, after losing a job or maybe a broken relationship. Imagine they feel the loss so deep that they're convinced the world would be better off without them.” Starting March 27, 2027, such Canadians “could walk into a doctor's office and ask them to end their life,” she said. “That's not a future scenario, that's the law right now waiting to take effect.” The Justin Trudeau government delayed expansion until 2024 and again until March 17, 2027, over concerns from medical and legal experts. “Clinical experts have warned that there's no evidence-based way to determine if someone with a mental illness would get better, and most do,” Jansen said. “But still the government is moving forward.” Jansen said the proposed law sends a message to “struggling Canadians, trauma survivors, those battling depression, schizophrenia, PTSD” that “death is a solution we're now willing to offer” in response to suffering. “That's not health care. That's not compassion. It's abandonment.” She told MPs: “Mental illness is treatable. Recovery is possible, but only if we show up and help.” Jansen's bill is similar to 2023 legislation that was narrowly defeated in Parliament but delayed implementation of the federal law. Conservative MP Ed Fast of Abbotsford, British Columbia, introduced Bill C-314, which would have stopped the expansion of Canada's euthanasia regime. It was defeated at second reading on Oct. 18, 2023, by a 167-150 vote. Fast gathered cross-party support for his legislation, with all 24 New Democratic Party (NDP) members voting in favor of his bill and eight members of the Liberal Party breaking ranks from their colleagues. The Bloc Québécois held the balance of power on the vote, as each of its members voted against the Abbotsford, British Columbia, representative's endeavor. During the oral question period preceding the vote, Fast condemned reports “of Canadians crying out for help and being offered assisted suicide instead.” He attacked “the sorry state of our mental health system,” saying: “Millions of Canadians oppose the government's fascination with assisted death.” A Christian political advocacy group praised Jansen's bill and called on MPs to support it regardless of party. “Canada can never be ready to offer MAID for mental illness,” said Daniel Zekveld, a policy analyst with the Association for Reformed Political Action Canada. “Doing so would undermine suicide prevention efforts and mental health care.

mov_9427C1955BD3973B0D47B7942413C27F,"  ProDentim is a relatively new oral health supplement that has recently drawn considerable attention due to its unique approach and positive feedback from users and some health professionals. According to its makers, this formula blends a variety of probiotic strains—many of which are supported by clinical studies—to promote a balanced oral microbiome and support gum and dental health. The CDC's oral health data highlights a concerning trend: around 21% of adults deal with tooth decay, and roughly 40% are affected by gum disease. Research suggests that conventional dental hygiene routines like brushing and flossing may not be enough to maintain optimal oral health. Restoring a healthy balance of bacteria in the mouth is believed to be a crucial step in preventing oral infections and inflammation. ProDentim is said to work by encouraging the growth of beneficial bacteria in the oral cavity while also supporting overall immune health. In this review, we'll take a comprehensive look at ProDentim's formulation , its intended mechanism of action, and the potential advantages it offers. Want fresher breath and stronger gums? Discover how ProDentim's probiotic formula can help We'll also explore practical details such as the product's pricing, where to purchase it, and whether any refund policies are in place. By the end of this analysis, we'll offer a clear verdict on whether ProDentim stands up to its claims and if it's a product worth considering for oral wellness.

Find out more about ProDentim's benefits and ordering options A Look at the Key Ingredients in ProDentim ProDentim combines 3.5 billion colony-forming units (CFUs) of beneficial probiotics with a carefully selected mix of four plant-based components. Each ingredient in the formula has been researched for its potential to promote healthier gums and teeth. Below is a breakdown of what goes into this oral health supplement: Lactobacillus paracasei Naturally present in both the mouth and gut, this probiotic strain supports a balanced oral microbiome by inhibiting the growth of harmful bacteria. Research indicates that it may help reduce the risk of tooth decay, calm gum inflammation, and prevent periodontal disease. B. lactis BL-04® Sourced from the large intestine, this well-documented probiotic plays a role in protecting the body against oral pathogens and enhancing immune response. It's also known for its role in digestive health and has been shown to lower the risk of respiratory infections like the common cold. Lactobacillus reuteri This probiotic is known for its powerful anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial effects. It helps protect the mouth from infection, including gingivitis and periodontitis, and can limit the growth of bacteria responsible for cavities and gum problems. Inulin A natural prebiotic fiber, inulin supports the growth of healthy oral bacteria while also reducing halitosis (bad breath). It promotes oral microbial balance, contributes to immune health, and may reduce the chances of gum issues. Malic Acid Found in various fruits and vegetables, malic acid helps stimulate natural saliva production, especially helpful for those dealing with dry mouth. It also assists in reducing bacterial buildup and may help gently whiten teeth by preventing surface stains. Additionally, malic acid offers benefits for skin renewal and exfoliation. Tricalcium Phosphate A commonly used compound in dental supplements, tricalcium phosphate supports enamel repair and is believed to aid in tooth remineralization. It may reduce tooth sensitivity, support nerve health, and assist in controlling plaque and tartar. Peppermint This aromatic herb is well-known for its freshening and antibacterial properties. Peppermint supports oral cleanliness by helping prevent plaque accumulation and soothing gum tissue. It's also helpful in relieving dry mouth and fighting unpleasant breath.

mov_CD8303AE6B74C36F01C9529F84DD06A7,"  Recent Supreme Court decisions underscore how viewpoint-based refusals of trademark applications are unconstitutional. But can these viewpoint-based refusals survive under the ""failure-to-function"" doctrine instead? Background: ­­­­Supreme Court Struck Down Bar on Registration of ""Disparaging,"" ""Immoral,"" and ""Scandalous"" Marks Eight years ago, in Matal v. Tam, 137 S. Ct. 1744 (2017), the United States Supreme Court struck down the Lanham Act's bar on registering trademarks that ""disparage"" persons, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols. The Court's decision in Tam was in response to the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)'s refusal to register an Asian American band's name, ""THE SLANTS."" There, the Court held that: (1) viewpoint-based trademark restrictions are unconstitutional under the First Amendment's Free Speech Clause; and (2) the disparagement clause was viewpoint-based and, therefore, unconstitutional. Two years later, in Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388 (2019), the Supreme Court heard Erik Brunetti's challenge to a neighboring provision of the Lanham Act: the ban on registering ""immoral or scandalous"" marks. In that case, Brunetti sought to register the name of his clothing brand ""F-U-C-T."" While pronounced as four discrete letters, the government alleged that the applied-for mark was ""the equivalent of the . . . past participle form of a well-known"" obscenity. There, the Court held that the bar on registering ""immoral or scandalous"" trademarks constituted viewpoint discrimination and was, consequently, a violation of the First Amendment. The USPTO Subsequently Invoked the ""Failure-to-Function"" Doctrine as a Basis for Refusing Brunetti's Applications for ""F***"" In addition to his application for the mark ""FUCT,"" Erik Brunetti filed four intent-to-use applications for the mark ""F***"" (spelled and pronounced as the present tense form of FUCT) in connection with various consumer goods and associated retail store services. While Brunetti's application for the mark ""FUCT"" was pending before the Supreme Court in Iancu v. Brunetti, his concurrent intent-to-use applications for F*** were suspended by the examining attorney assigned to review the applications. Upon resolution of Brunetti, the USPTO examining attorney re-examined the applications and subsequently refused registration based on a conclusion that the applied-for mark ""fails to function"" as a trademark. Notably, this basis for refusal was not raised until after the Court's Brunetti decision, striking the ""immoral or scandalous"" basis of refusal as impermissibly viewpoint-based. The Examiner Found That the Applied-For Mark is ""Commonly Used"" and Thus Less Likely to be Perceived as a Source Identifier In support of the foregoing ""failure-to-function"" refusals, the examining attorney offered evidence in the form of articles and dictionary definitions, which, according to the examiner, ""illustrates that the term is commonly used as a versatile expression conveying a wide range of emotion, from disdain to joy."" See Examiner's Brief Filed with the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board at p. 12, available here. The examining attorney argued that ""[b]ecause consumers are accustomed to seeing this term or expression commonly used in everyday speech by many different sources, they would not perceive the use of the term as a mark identifying the source of Applicant's goods and/or services but rather as only conveying an informational message or sentiment."" The Examiner Relied on Evidence Showing Ornamental Use of the Applied-For Mark The examiner also sought out and relied upon evidence from third-party sources such as Amazon and Etsy to show the word ""F***"" used in a decorative or ornamental fashion on several of the goods listed in Brunetti's applications, including phone cases, jewelry, wallets, and tote bags. The examiner explained such evidence ""illustrates that many competitors use the term as an informational message on jewelry, bags, phone cases, and many other items"" and that ""[t]o allow the Applicant to appropriate the term for its proposed goods and services would prevent competitors from using the commonplace term to promote their own goods and services."" The Refusal Survived Appeal The Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB or Board) upheld the examiner's refusal of the marks based on a failure to function. In doing so, the Board found that the evidence of record establishes that the applied-for word ""F***"" expresses well-recognized familiar sentiments and that relevant consumers are accustomed to seeing the word in widespread use on the types of goods identified in Brunetti's applications. Accordingly, the Board concluded that the word ""F***"" does not function as a trademark distinguishing Brunetti's goods and services in commerce. Brunetti Asserted ""Failure-to-Function"" is a ""Novel"" Doctrine Used to Circumvent Bans on Viewpoint-Based Refusals In response to the Board's decision, Brunetti asserted that failure-to-function is an ""invalid"" substantive refusal lacking statutory basis. Brunetti accused the USPTO of weaponizing a procedural doctrine to ""evade the Supreme Court's decisions"" in Tam and Brunetti, thereby creating a new backdoor substantive doctrine. Under this well-established procedural doctrine, if a submitted specimen ""demonstrates merely ornamental use"" of an applied-for mark, then the USPTO can issue a refusal of the mark for failing to function as a trademark. In his briefings, Brunetti argued that the USPTO has since expanded this procedural refusal to create a ""novel, substantive doctrine"" under which some words can never be registered. He noted that ""it was not a coincidence"" that these same words ""would have been refused under Section 2(a) prior to Tam and Brunetti."" In addition to asserting that the new failure-to-function doctrine was invalid, Brunetti contended that it lacked consistent standards and contradicted ""fundamental principles of trademark law."" Brunetti alleged that the refusals of his applications were ""predetermined,"" as evidenced by the USPTO's continuous ""discovery of new grounds."" Illustrating this point, Brunetti pointed to the justifications offered by the USPTO for why ""F***"" could not be registered and explained how the evidence did not support their rationale. Brunetti submitted that all of the USPTO's evidence of ""use"" was ornamental, which cannot ""preclude a term from being perceived as a trademark."" On the contrary, Brunetti pointed to examples of other ""widely used"" words and phrases that are registered: ""LOVE,"" ""APPLE,"" and ""DELTA."" Consequently, Brunetti argued that if the USPTO's approach was correct, these words should also be unregistrable. Federal Circuit Expressed Skepticism During Oral Arguments On March 10, 2025, a panel of Federal Circuit judges heard oral arguments on behalf of Mr. Brunetti and the USPTO. During oral arguments, the court questioned how the USPTO could judge how a mark would be perceived by consumers, where, as here, the mark is not yet being used by the applicant in connection with its goods and services. Notably, in its briefing, the USPTO criticized Brunetti for failing to present evidence that consumers would perceive the word ""F***"" as a source identifier. However, when asked during oral arguments what type of evidence Brunetti was supposed to present to show consumer perception, the attorney for the USPTO failed to provide any examples. Instead, the USPTO's attorney opined that ""it would probably be difficult given the nature of this particular proposed mark in the classes for which [Brunetti] has applied for it, to demonstrate that consumers are going to understand it as, as a trademark.""

Mi amistad contigo se debe a que yo soy una persona y tú eres una persona'. > La visita del presidente de Brasil será la primera que se conoce que Cristina Kirchner pide autorización. > Cuando el Tribunal Oral le otorgó a la ex presidenta la prisión domiciliaria le impuso un régimen de visitas. Allí se estableció que familiares, médicos, custodios y abogados de Cristina Kirchner deberían formar parte de una lista y que podían ingresar al domicilio sin requerir autorización. Pero cualquier otra persona debería pedirla. > [Cristina Kirchner en su prisión]( auth=da97d1e1f3b8b5f1df94c5fe5ece5f9ccd3a2ce4ce7fe4a6f176c482c81b4085&smart=true&width=350&height=233&quality=85) > Cristina Kirchner en su prisión domiciliaria (REUTERS/Mariana Nedelcu/File Photo) > La defensa presentó ese listado y hoy el tribunal dio su aprobación. Pero Cristina Kirchner objetó que se le ponga un límite para las visitas y que deban pedir autorización. Sus abogados, **Alberto Beraldi y Ary Llernovoy**, señalaron que no hay ninguna normativa que determine que se debe limitar las visitas en prisión domiciliarias y que en la práctica eso no ocurre en otros casos. > Así, apelaron la resolución del Tribunal Oral para que intervenga la Cámara Federal de Casación Penal. La Sala IV de Casación convocó a una audiencia para el próximo lunes a las 12 horas para escuchar los argumentos de las partes. Luego de eso los jueces **Mariano Borinsky, Gustavo Hornos y Diego Barroetaveña** quedarán en condiciones de resolver. > No será el único punto de la causa en la que deban intervenir. El tribunal Oral hoy aceptó otras dos apelaciones para que las analice Casación. > Una es la que presentaron los fiscales federales **Diego Luciani y Sergio Mola** para que [se revoque la prisión domiciliaria y que Cristina Kirchner cumpla la condena en una cárcel]( """"). La Fiscalía planteó también que si continúa en esa modalidad no sea en el departamento de San José 1.111, sino en otro domicilio. > La segunda apelación la hizo la defensa que pidió que se le quite la pulsera electrónica a Cristina Kirchner.

La sentencia considera probado que la red dirigida por Francisco Correa se extendió a “comunidades y municipios gobernados por el Partido Popular, debido a su estrecha relación con cargos y miembros de este partido”. Entre estos municipios, la madrileña localidad de Arganda. La sentencia condena a todos los procesados por delitos como cohecho, fraude a la administración pública o malversación entre otros, al amañar las adjudicaciones en la localidad en detrimento de los ciudadanos para beneficiar a la organización. A cambio, los políticos implicados obtenían prebendas en forma de regalos, viajes y dinero en efectivo. Entre los condenados se encuentran el exalcalde del PP Ginés López con 5 años y 7 meses de cárcel, el exdiputado popular Benjamín Martín Vasco con 5 años y 11 meses, o miembros de la trama como el líder Francisco Correa y su mano derecha, Pablo Crespo, con 8 años y 10 meses de presidio. Los empresarios corruptores como Fernando Martín, expresidente del Real Madrid, también son condenados. En su caso, 3 años y 4 meses de prisión. Las condenas son relativamente bajas porque casi la totalidad de los procesados habían alcanzado un acuerdo de conformidad con la Fiscalía Anticorrupción antes de que tuviera lugar la vista oral. El caso Gürtel arrancó con las primeras detenciones ordenadas por el juez Baltasar Garzón en 2009.

But you came, goddess, and freed him from his bonds,* ***when you had quickly called to high Olympus him of the hundred hands****, whom the gods call Briareus, but all men Aegaeon; for he is mightier than his father. * ***He sat down by the side of the son of Cronos, exulting in his glory, and the blessed gods were seized with fear of him, and did not bind Zeus. *** The key language here is that they wished to put him in bonds, but did not bind him. The way it reads is that they plotted to chain him, but were stifled in their plans by the presence of Briareus. If the intention was that they successfully bound Zeus, they wouldn't write that they literally didn't bind Zeus in the same passage. The language here implies that Thetis was made aware of the plans and stopped it before it could happen, and that ""Freeing Zeus from his bonds"" is poetic language for freeing him from by foiling the plan rather than by literally untying him. Which is why they ""Wished"" to put him in bonds, why he was freed when she called Briareus up to Olympus rather than by her literally untying him, and why the blessed gods were so seized with fear that they ""Did not bind Zeus"". Like if Zeus was hogtied here, this would at least be a very weird way to word it, right? The later accounts I'm referencing come from exegetical scholarship. As in, ancient scholars who critically examined the text and added context after it was written. Most notably the works known as the b and T Scholia, which reference even older ancient works that we don't have anymore. We also get Apollo's presence through these texts, with writers in later antiquity substituting in Athena's name for Apollo. This is why modern scholarship is relevant, many of these texts are untranslated and fragmentary, and it is the job of modern scholarship to translate and make reference to them. Whether or not this was Homer's intention with the story is another discussion, but this is where we fall into the pitfall of trying to assign a ""Canon"" to a collection of mostly lost oral traditions and living myths. When does Greek mythology ""End"". How recent does a source need to be for it to be completely invalid? Only sources from during the widespread worship? Then Ovid would be valid. Only the oldest possible myths? Then we're talking Mycenaean and Minoan myths. No Roman stuff? Why not? Etc etc. Also you're missing the point of me bringing up the boast. It's not JUST that he was boasting, but that the other gods (Including the apparently equally as powerful (Citation needed) Athena) BELIEVE him. Even the ones who you say were apparently able to beat him in a fight and bind him seem to 100% believe that he could take them all in a fight, none of them challenge or question his claims, not even when he isn't in earshot. This is also consistent with the rest of the text. Outside of the one incident where he could've theoretically been bound if you interpret it in a certain way and omit the passage where it says he literally wasn't bound, there are several incidents in which other gods, including Poseidon himself, acknowledge that Zeus is stronger than they are. Also it's funny that you bring up Athena being equally strong because Athena herself is the one who confirms the truth of Zeus' boast when she speaks on behalf of the Olympians in saying that she believes him and acknowledges that he's stronger!","Quoting the full Iliad segment: *But, you, if you are able, guard your own son; go to Olympus and make prayer to Zeus, if ever you have gladdened his heart by word or deed. For often I have heard you glorying in the halls of my father, and* ***declaring that you alone among the immortals warded off shameful ruin from the son of Cronos, lord of the dark clouds, on the day when the other Olympians wished to put him in bonds****, even Hera and Poseidon and Pallas Athene. But you came, goddess, and freed him from his bonds,* ***when you had quickly called to high Olympus him of the hundred hands****, whom the gods call Briareus, but all men Aegaeon; for he is mightier than his father. * ***He sat down by the side of the son of Cronos, exulting in his glory, and the blessed gods were seized with fear of him, and did not bind Zeus. *** The key language here is that they wished to put him in bonds, but did not bind him.

The plaintiffs in these cases alleged that companies unlawfully used technologies like “session replay” software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The court assessed how CIPA, an older wiretapping law, applies to modern website tracking like session replay and chatbots, focusing on definitions of “interception” and “contents.” A Ninth Circuit court of appeals panel reviewed three separate proposed class actions against Papa John's International Inc., Converse Inc., and Bloomingdale's, all centered on whether certain website tracking activities violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The Core Issue: CIPA and Website Communications    At the core of these cases is the application of CIPA Section 631 , a statute originally enacted to address traditional wiretapping and eavesdropping, to modern website tracking technologies. CIPA Section 631(a) imposes liability on an entity that “intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection . . . with any telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, or willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report or communication while the same is in transit . . . ”  The same section also imposes liability on an entity that “aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons” to commit one or more of the aforesaid acts.” The recent surge in CIPA litigation has targeted companies employing these tracking technologies, seeking to recover statutory damages of $5,000 per violation. The Allegations: Website Tracking and the California Invasion of Privacy Act    The plaintiffs in these cases allege that companies unlawfully used technologies like “session replay” software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The Lower Court Decisions and the Ninth Circuit's Considerations    Papa John's: In  Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc. , the plaintiff alleged that Papa John's unlawfully eavesdropped and wiretapped by capturing customers' website interactions using tracking software and sent the data to a third-party. The lower court dismissed the case, determining that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege that Papa John's engaged in or aided and abetted wiretapping. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit found, “Thomas alleged that Papa John's directly violated section 631(a) of the California Penal Code by 'eavesdrop[ping] and learn[ing] the content of its users' communications.' But a party to a conversation cannot be liable under section 631 for 'eavesdropping' on its own conversation,” the panel said. “Thomas did not allege that Papa John's violated section 631 by aiding another party in eavesdropping.” Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that Papa John's, as a party to the communications, can't be liable for spying on its own conversation. Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc. . Bloomingdale's:  In  Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's LLC et al. , the plaintiff alleged that Bloomingdale's used session replay code to capture and disclose the “contents” of website communications to a third-party vendor without user consent, violating CIPA Section 631. The district court granted the motion of Bloomingdale motion to dismiss Mikulsky's complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On appeal, Bloomingdale's argued that masking text fields prevented the vendor from viewing this data, however, the Ninth Circuit panel reversed the lower court's decision finding that the district court erred in dismissing Mikulsky's claim under CIPA section 631(a), finding that the complaint stated sufficient facts to allege that Defendants aided, agreed with, employed, or conspired with Session Replay Code providers to enable the providers to read, attempt to read, or to learn “the contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same [was] in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or [was] being sent from, or received at any place within this state,” without the consent of all parties. The court further found that the complaint alleged real-time capture of the contents of Mikulsky's communications on Defendants' website without her consent, not merely the real-time capture of information regarding the characteristics of the communications. Mikulsky v. Bloomingdales, LLC, et al. Converse:  In  Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al . , the claims revolved around Converse's use of online customer service chat features allowing users to interact with Converse customer service agents through text-based communication directly on its website and whether the communications through these features could be considered analogous to traditional telephone communications covered by CIPA. The district court granted Converse's motion for summary judgment finding that the internet transmissions, specifically the online chat features, were not analogous to traditional telephone communications as covered by CIPA Section 631, finding this clause applies solely to “telephone communications”. The court also found that the chat provider did not engage in wiretapping, as the messages were encrypted in transit and password-protected on the provider's servers, preventing the “willful and without consent” reading of communications as required for CIPA liability. On appeal, during the Ninth Circuit's hearing of oral arguments, Judge Jay S. Bybee expressed concerns about applying a statute adopted in 1967 to modern internet technology, describing it as “very anachronistic”. Judge Baybee suggested that the plaintiff might be better served asserting her claims under a more recent California statute designed to protect consumers' online privacy. The court has yet to rule on the appeal. Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al . Key Takeaways: Implications for Businesses    The Ninth Circuit's decisions in  Thomas v. Papa John's, Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's , and  Gutierrez v. Converse  represent a critical moment in the ongoing debate over how existing privacy laws, apply to modern website tracking technologies. Balancing Old Law and New Technology:  These cases highlight the ongoing challenge of interpreting and applying older privacy laws to rapidly evolving internet technology. The Ninth Circuit's decisions offer insight into how courts are grappling with these complexities, focusing on the technical specifics of data capture and the specific requirements of CIPA's various clauses. The Ninth Circuit's review allowed it to address key questions about applying CIPA, a law originally focused on telephone wiretapping, to modern internet communications, and what level of consent is required for tracking technologies. The appeals aimed to clarify the scope of CIPA liability for businesses using tracking technologies and to guide courts on how to interpret and apply this older law in the context of rapidly evolving online privacy issues.

The court also found that the chat provider did not engage in wiretapping, as the messages were encrypted in transit and password-protected on the provider's servers, preventing the “willful and without consent” reading of communications as required for CIPA liability. On appeal, during the Ninth Circuit's hearing of oral arguments, Judge Jay S. Bybee expressed concerns about applying a statute adopted in 1967 to modern internet technology, describing it as “very anachronistic”. Judge Baybee suggested that the plaintiff might be better served asserting her claims under a more recent California statute designed to protect consumers' online privacy. The court has yet to rule on the appeal. Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al . Key Takeaways: Implications for Businesses The Ninth Circuit's decisions in Thomas v. Papa John's, Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's , and Gutierrez v. Converse represent a critical moment in the ongoing debate over how existing privacy laws, apply to modern website tracking technologies. Balancing Old Law and New Technology: These cases highlight the ongoing challenge of interpreting and applying older privacy laws to rapidly evolving internet technology. The Ninth Circuit's decisions offer insight into how courts are grappling with these complexities, focusing on the technical specifics of data capture and the specific requirements of CIPA's various clauses. The Ninth Circuit's review allowed it to address key questions about applying CIPA, a law originally focused on telephone wiretapping, to modern internet communications, and what level of consent is required for tracking technologies. The appeals aimed to clarify the scope of CIPA liability for businesses using tracking technologies and to guide courts on how to interpret and apply this older law in the context of rapidly evolving online privacy issues.

mov_61B3E8918BAF245BEC140AFB142CFC3F,"  The second quarter of 2025 delivered a wave of meaningful developments in hepatology—from FDA approvals that expand therapeutic options to promising pipeline data that could shape the future of care across a spectrum of liver diseases and the launch of a new hepatology podcast hosted by some of the field's leading experts. Here's a recap of what made headlines in Q2 of 2025: Hepatic Regulatory Approvals FDA Approves Maralixibat (Livmarli) Tablet for Alagille Syndrome, PFIC On April 14, 2025, the FDA approved a new tablet formulation of maralixibat (Livmarli) for the treatment of cholestatic pruritus in patients with Alagille syndrome (ALGS) and progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis (PFIC). “The approval of LIVMARLI in tablet form provides a meaningful additional treatment option for patients with ALGS and PFIC. It allows flexibility for patients and physicians, with the liquid dosing used by the youngest patients and a convenient one-tablet per dose option for older patients,” said Peter Radovich, president and chief operating officer at Mirum. “We have had tremendous success with LIVMARLI since its launch and we hope that the availability of the tablet will provide convenience that positively impacts patients' lives.” FDA Approves Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir (Mavyret) Label Expansion for Acute HCV On June 11, 2025, the FDA approved a label expansion for AbbVie's glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (Mavyret), an oral pangenotypic direct acting antiviral (DAA) therapy. With the decision, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir became approved for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients ≥ 3 years of age with acute or chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection without cirrhosis or with compensated cirrhosis. The approval was supported by data from the phase 3, multicenter, single-arm prospective M20-350 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 8-week treatment in adults with acute HCV infection. Key Pipeline Updates Pemvidutide Shows Significant MASH Effects, Weight Loss at 24 Weeks in Phase 2b IMPACT Trial On June 26, 2025, Altimmune announced the phase 2b IMPACT trial of pemvidutide in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) met its primary endpoint with statistically significant MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis in up to 59.1% of participants and fibrosis improvement without worsening of MASH in up to 34.5% of participants in intent-to-treat analyses as well as weight loss of up to 6.2% at 24 weeks with no plateauing. Of note, the data make pemvidutide the first product candidate to demonstrate significant MASH effects and weight loss at 24 weeks. Hydronidone Meets Primary Endpoint in Phase 3 Hepatitis B Trial ON May 22, 2025, Gyre Therapeutics announced hydronidone met the primary endpoint for ≥1-stage regression in liver fibrosis compared to placebo in a pivotal phase 3 trial evaluating its efficacy and safety for the treatment of liver fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B in China. Based on these data, Gyre indicated plans to file an investigational new drug (IND) application in the third quarter of 2025. Pending IND clearance, the company will look to initiate a phase 2 trial in the US evaluating hydronidone for the treatment of MASH-associated fibrosis in the second half of 2025. Efruxifermin Shows Potential for Fibrosis Reduction in Phase 2b MASH Cirrhosis Trial Efruxifermin, a bivalent fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) analogue being developed for the treatment of MASH, failed to significantly reduce fibrosis without worsening of MASH at 36 weeks in the phase 2b SYMMETRY trial. However, further analysis revealed the 50 mg dose of efruxifermin may have possible benefit on fibrosis reduction at 96 weeks. Notably, efruxifermin also appeared to be associated with improvements in MASH-related histologic findings, noninvasive markers of liver injury and fibrosis, and markers of glucose and lipid metabolism. Semaglutide Improves Steatohepatitis, Fibrosis in Phase 3 MASH Trial Data from part 1 of the phase 3 Effect of Semaglutide in Subjects with Non-cirrhotic Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis (ESSENCE) trial highlight the safety and efficacy of semaglutide for the treatment of patients with MASH and stage 2/3 fibrosis. Results showed once-weekly semaglutide 2.4 mg outperformed placebo for resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fibrosis and reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis. “The ESSENCE data may represent key findings for patients in the treatment of MASH, which is estimated to affect about one in 20 adults in the US,” said Arun Sanyal, MD, ESSENCE lead author and director of the Stravitz-Sanyal Institute for Liver Disease and Metabolic Health at Virginia Commonwealth University. “By treating both liver disease and its metabolic causes, semaglutide offers a promising new approach for millions of patients.” Phase 2 ELMWOOD Data for Elafibranor in PSC, with Cynthia Levy, MD Data from the phase 2 ELMWOOD study of elafibranor in patients with primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) shed light on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonist's safety and tolerability in this patient population, suggesting elafibranor may be a potential treatment option for PSC, a chronic liver disease for which none currently exist. HCPLive Launches Flagship Hepatology Podcast Liver Lineup: Updates & Unfiltered Insights Q2 saw the launch of HCPLive's first hepatology podcast, Liver Lineup: Updates & Unfiltered Insights. Hosted by Drs. Nancy Reau and Kim Brown, the series dives into the cutting edge of liver disease research, clinical care, and real-world practice. Intended for hepatologists, gastroenterologists, and other clinicians managing liver disease, Liver Lineup will unpack the latest research, debate emerging controversies, and spotlight developments that could shape — or sharpen — day-to-day practice, all with unfiltered perspective and clarity. In their first 2 episodes, Reau and Brown break down 7 of the top abstracts presented at the 2025 European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) Congress.

mov_2562E095FA028B6CCFF751628CEBF343,"  Key Takeaways: The Ninth Circuit court of appeals reviewed three separate proposed class actions against Papa John's International Inc., Converse Inc., and Bloomingdale's, all centered on whether certain website tracking activities violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The plaintiffs in these cases alleged that companies unlawfully used technologies like “session replay” software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The court assessed how CIPA, an older wiretapping law, applies to modern website tracking like session replay and chatbots, focusing on definitions of “interception” and “contents.” A Ninth Circuit court of appeals panel reviewed three separate proposed class actions against Papa John's International Inc., Converse Inc., and Bloomingdale's, all centered on whether certain website tracking activities violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The Core Issue: CIPA and Website Communications At the core of these cases is the application of CIPA Section 631, a statute originally enacted to address traditional wiretapping and eavesdropping, to modern website tracking technologies. CIPA Section 631(a) imposes liability on an entity that “intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection . . . with any telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, or willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report or communication while the same is in transit . . . ” The same section also imposes liability on an entity that “aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons” to commit one or more of the aforesaid acts.” The recent surge in CIPA litigation has targeted companies employing these tracking technologies, seeking to recover statutory damages of $5,000 per violation. The Allegations: Website Tracking and the California Invasion of Privacy Act The plaintiffs in these cases allege that companies unlawfully used technologies like “session replay” software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The Lower Court Decisions and the Ninth Circuit's Considerations Papa John's: In Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc., the plaintiff alleged that Papa John's unlawfully eavesdropped and wiretapped by capturing customers' website interactions using tracking software and sent the data to a third-party. The lower court dismissed the case, determining that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege that Papa John's engaged in or aided and abetted wiretapping. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit found, “Thomas alleged that Papa John's directly violated section 631(a) of the California Penal Code by 'eavesdrop[ping] and learn[ing] the content of its users' communications.' But a party to a conversation cannot be liable under section 631 for 'eavesdropping' on its own conversation,” the panel said. “Thomas did not allege that Papa John's violated section 631 by aiding another party in eavesdropping.” Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that Papa John's, as a party to the communications, can't be liable for spying on its own conversation. Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc.. Bloomingdale's: In Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's LLC et al., the plaintiff alleged that Bloomingdale's used session replay code to capture and disclose the “contents” of website communications to a third-party vendor without user consent, violating CIPA Section 631. The district court granted the motion of Bloomingdale motion to dismiss Mikulsky's complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On appeal, Bloomingdale's argued that masking text fields prevented the vendor from viewing this data, however, the Ninth Circuit panel reversed the lower court's decision finding that the district court erred in dismissing Mikulsky's claim under CIPA section 631(a), finding that the complaint stated sufficient facts to allege that Defendants aided, agreed with, employed, or conspired with Session Replay Code providers to enable the providers to read, attempt to read, or to learn “the contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same [was] in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or [was] being sent from, or received at any place within this state,” without the consent of all parties. The court further found that the complaint alleged real-time capture of the contents of Mikulsky's communications on Defendants' website without her consent, not merely the real-time capture of information regarding the characteristics of the communications. Mikulsky v. Bloomingdales, LLC, et al. Converse: In Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al., the claims revolved around Converse's use of online customer service chat features allowing users to interact with Converse customer service agents through text-based communication directly on its website and whether the communications through these features could be considered analogous to traditional telephone communications covered by CIPA. The district court granted Converse's motion for summary judgment finding that the internet transmissions, specifically the online chat features, were not analogous to traditional telephone communications as covered by CIPA Section 631, finding this clause applies solely to “telephone communications”.

CIPA Section 631(a) imposes liability on an entity that “intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection . . . with any telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, or willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report or communication while the same is in transit . . . ”  The same section also imposes liability on an entity that “aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons” to commit one or more of the aforesaid acts.” The recent surge in CIPA litigation has targeted companies employing these tracking technologies, seeking to recover statutory damages of $5,000 per violation. The Allegations: Website Tracking and the California Invasion of Privacy Act The plaintiffs in these cases allege that companies unlawfully used technologies like “session replay” software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The Lower Court Decisions and the Ninth Circuit's Considerations Papa John's: In Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc., the plaintiff alleged that Papa John's unlawfully eavesdropped and wiretapped by capturing customers' website interactions using tracking software and sent the data to a third-party. The lower court dismissed the case, determining that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege that Papa John's engaged in or aided and abetted wiretapping. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit found, “Thomas alleged that Papa John's directly violated section 631(a) of the California Penal Code by 'eavesdrop[ping] and learn[ing] the content of its users' communications.' But a party to a conversation cannot be liable under section 631 for 'eavesdropping' on its own conversation,” the panel said. “Thomas did not allege that Papa John's violated section 631 by aiding another party in eavesdropping.” Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that Papa John's, as a party to the communications, can't be liable for spying on its own conversation. Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc.. Bloomingdale's: In Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's LLC et al., the plaintiff alleged that Bloomingdale's used session replay code to capture and disclose the “contents” of website communications to a third-party vendor without user consent, violating CIPA Section 631. The district court granted the motion of Bloomingdale motion to dismiss Mikulsky's complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On appeal, Bloomingdale's argued that masking text fields prevented the vendor from viewing this data, however, the Ninth Circuit panel reversed the lower court's decision finding that the district court erred in dismissing Mikulsky's claim under CIPA section 631(a), finding that the complaint stated sufficient facts to allege that Defendants aided, agreed with, employed, or conspired with Session Replay Code providers to enable the providers to read, attempt to read, or to learn “the contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same [was] in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or [was] being sent from, or received at any place within this state,” without the consent of all parties. The court further found that the complaint alleged real-time capture of the contents of Mikulsky's communications on Defendants' website without her consent, not merely the real-time capture of information regarding the characteristics of the communications. Mikulsky v. Bloomingdales, LLC, et al. Converse: In Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al., the claims revolved around Converse's use of online customer service chat features allowing users to interact with Converse customer service agents through text-based communication directly on its website and whether the communications through these features could be considered analogous to traditional telephone communications covered by CIPA. The district court granted Converse's motion for summary judgment finding that the internet transmissions, specifically the online chat features, were not analogous to traditional telephone communications as covered by CIPA Section 631, finding this clause applies solely to “telephone communications”. The court also found that the chat provider did not engage in wiretapping, as the messages were encrypted in transit and password-protected on the provider's servers, preventing the “willful and without consent” reading of communications as required for CIPA liability. On appeal, during the Ninth Circuit's hearing of oral arguments, Judge Jay S. Bybee expressed concerns about applying a statute adopted in 1967 to modern internet technology, describing it as “very anachronistic”. Judge Baybee suggested that the plaintiff might be better served asserting her claims under a more recent California statute designed to protect consumers' online privacy. The court has yet to rule on the appeal. Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al. Key Takeaways: Implications for Businesses The Ninth Circuit's decisions in Thomas v. Papa John's, Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's, and Gutierrez v. Converse represent a critical moment in the ongoing debate over how existing privacy laws, apply to modern website tracking technologies. Balancing Old Law and New Technology: These cases highlight the ongoing challenge of interpreting and applying older privacy laws to rapidly evolving internet technology. The Ninth Circuit's decisions offer insight into how courts are grappling with these complexities, focusing on the technical specifics of data capture and the specific requirements of CIPA's various clauses. The Ninth Circuit's review allowed it to address key questions about applying CIPA, a law originally focused on telephone wiretapping, to modern internet communications, and what level of consent is required for tracking technologies. The appeals aimed to clarify the scope of CIPA liability for businesses using tracking technologies and to guide courts on how to interpret and apply this older law in the context of rapidly evolving online privacy issues.

mov_7D7E3DB0D1471EC54414006FEBA1C8D9,"  Key Takeaways: The Ninth Circuit court of appeals reviewed three separate proposed class actions against Papa John's International Inc., Converse Inc., and Bloomingdale's, all centered on whether certain website tracking activities violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The plaintiffs in these cases alleged that companies unlawfully used technologies like “session replay” software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The court assessed how CIPA, an older wiretapping law, applies to modern website tracking like session replay and chatbots, focusing on definitions of “interception” and “contents.” A Ninth Circuit court of appeals panel reviewed three separate proposed class actions against Papa John's International Inc., Converse Inc., and Bloomingdale's, all centered on whether certain website tracking activities violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). The Core Issue: CIPA and Website Communications At the core of these cases is the application of CIPA Section 631, a statute originally enacted to address traditional wiretapping and eavesdropping, to modern website tracking technologies. CIPA Section 631(a) imposes liability on an entity that “intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection . . . with any telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, or willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report or communication while the same is in transit . . . ”  The same section also imposes liability on an entity that “aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons” to commit one or more of the aforesaid acts.” The recent surge in CIPA litigation has targeted companies employing these tracking technologies, seeking to recover statutory damages of $5,000 per violation. The Allegations: Website Tracking and the California Invasion of Privacy Act The plaintiffs in these cases allege that companies unlawfully used technologies like “session replay” software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The Lower Court Decisions and the Ninth Circuit's Considerations Papa John's: In Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc., the plaintiff alleged that Papa John's unlawfully eavesdropped and wiretapped by capturing customers' website interactions using tracking software and sent the data to a third-party. The lower court dismissed the case, determining that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege that Papa John's engaged in or aided and abetted wiretapping. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit found, “Thomas alleged that Papa John's directly violated section 631(a) of the California Penal Code by 'eavesdrop[ping] and learn[ing] the content of its users' communications.' But a party to a conversation cannot be liable under section 631 for 'eavesdropping' on its own conversation,” the panel said. “Thomas did not allege that Papa John's violated section 631 by aiding another party in eavesdropping.” Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that Papa John's, as a party to the communications, can't be liable for spying on its own conversation. Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc.. Bloomingdale's: In Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's LLC et al., the plaintiff alleged that Bloomingdale's used session replay code to capture and disclose the “contents” of website communications to a third-party vendor without user consent, violating CIPA Section 631. The district court granted the motion of Bloomingdale motion to dismiss Mikulsky's complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On appeal, Bloomingdale's argued that masking text fields prevented the vendor from viewing this data, however, the Ninth Circuit panel reversed the lower court's decision finding that the district court erred in dismissing Mikulsky's claim under CIPA section 631(a), finding that the complaint stated sufficient facts to allege that Defendants aided, agreed with, employed, or conspired with Session Replay Code providers to enable the providers to read, attempt to read, or to learn “the contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same [was] in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or [was] being sent from, or received at any place within this state,” without the consent of all parties. The court further found that the complaint alleged real-time capture of the contents of Mikulsky's communications on Defendants' website without her consent, not merely the real-time capture of information regarding the characteristics of the communications. Mikulsky v. Bloomingdales, LLC, et al. Converse: In Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al., the claims revolved around Converse's use of online customer service chat features allowing users to interact with Converse customer service agents through text-based communication directly on its website and whether the communications through these features could be considered analogous to traditional telephone communications covered by CIPA. The district court granted Converse's motion for summary judgment finding that the internet transmissions, specifically the online chat features, were not analogous to traditional telephone communications as covered by CIPA Section 631, finding this clause applies solely to “telephone communications”. The court also found that the chat provider did not engage in wiretapping, as the messages were encrypted in transit and password-protected on the provider's servers, preventing the “willful and without consent” reading of communications as required for CIPA liability. On appeal, during the Ninth Circuit's hearing of oral arguments, Judge Jay S. Bybee expressed concerns about applying a statute adopted in 1967 to modern internet technology, describing it as “very anachronistic”. Judge Baybee suggested that the plaintiff might be better served asserting her claims under a more recent California statute designed to protect consumers' online privacy. The court has yet to rule on the appeal. Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al. Key Takeaways: Implications for Businesses The Ninth Circuit's decisions in Thomas v. Papa John's, Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's, and Gutierrez v. Converse represent a critical moment in the ongoing debate over how existing privacy laws, apply to modern website tracking technologies. Balancing Old Law and New Technology: These cases highlight the ongoing challenge of interpreting and applying older privacy laws to rapidly evolving internet technology. The Ninth Circuit's decisions offer insight into how courts are grappling with these complexities, focusing on the technical specifics of data capture and the specific requirements of CIPA's various clauses. The Ninth Circuit's review allowed it to address key questions about applying CIPA, a law originally focused on telephone wiretapping, to modern internet communications, and what level of consent is required for tracking technologies. The appeals aimed to clarify the scope of CIPA liability for businesses using tracking technologies and to guide courts on how to interpret and apply this older law in the context of rapidly evolving online privacy issues.

But a party to a conversation cannot be liable under section 631 for 'eavesdropping' on its own conversation,” the panel said. “Thomas did not allege that Papa John's violated section 631 by aiding another party in eavesdropping.” Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that Papa John's, as a party to the communications, can't be liable for spying on its own conversation. Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc.. Bloomingdale's: In Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's LLC et al., the plaintiff alleged that Bloomingdale's used session replay code to capture and disclose the “contents” of website communications to a third-party vendor without user consent, violating CIPA Section 631. The district court granted the motion of Bloomingdale motion to dismiss Mikulsky's complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On appeal, Bloomingdale's argued that masking text fields prevented the vendor from viewing this data, however, the Ninth Circuit panel reversed the lower court's decision finding that the district court erred in dismissing Mikulsky's claim under CIPA section 631(a), finding that the complaint stated sufficient facts to allege that Defendants aided, agreed with, employed, or conspired with Session Replay Code providers to enable the providers to read, attempt to read, or to learn “the contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same [was] in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or [was] being sent from, or received at any place within this state,” without the consent of all parties. The court further found that the complaint alleged real-time capture of the contents of Mikulsky's communications on Defendants' website without her consent, not merely the real-time capture of information regarding the characteristics of the communications. Mikulsky v. Bloomingdales, LLC, et al. Converse: In Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al., the claims revolved around Converse's use of online customer service chat features allowing users to interact with Converse customer service agents through text-based communication directly on its website and whether the communications through these features could be considered analogous to traditional telephone communications covered by CIPA. The district court granted Converse's motion for summary judgment finding that the internet transmissions, specifically the online chat features, were not analogous to traditional telephone communications as covered by CIPA Section 631, finding this clause applies solely to “telephone communications”. The court also found that the chat provider did not engage in wiretapping, as the messages were encrypted in transit and password-protected on the provider's servers, preventing the “willful and without consent” reading of communications as required for CIPA liability. On appeal, during the Ninth Circuit's hearing of oral arguments, Judge Jay S. Bybee expressed concerns about applying a statute adopted in 1967 to modern internet technology, describing it as “very anachronistic”. Judge Baybee suggested that the plaintiff might be better served asserting her claims under a more recent California statute designed to protect consumers' online privacy. The court has yet to rule on the appeal. Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al. Key Takeaways: Implications for Businesses The Ninth Circuit's decisions in Thomas v. Papa John's, Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's, and Gutierrez v. Converse represent a critical moment in the ongoing debate over how existing privacy laws, apply to modern website tracking technologies. Balancing Old Law and New Technology: These cases highlight the ongoing challenge of interpreting and applying older privacy laws to rapidly evolving internet technology. The Ninth Circuit's decisions offer insight into how courts are grappling with these complexities, focusing on the technical specifics of data capture and the specific requirements of CIPA's various clauses. The Ninth Circuit's review allowed it to address key questions about applying CIPA, a law originally focused on telephone wiretapping, to modern internet communications, and what level of consent is required for tracking technologies. The appeals aimed to clarify the scope of CIPA liability for businesses using tracking technologies and to guide courts on how to interpret and apply this older law in the context of rapidly evolving online privacy issues.

5BE838FE74DE54A0893D659C794F84A4,"  Pune: A man, posing as a courier   delivery agent, entered a 22-year-old data scientist's 11th floor rented flat in a residential society in Kondhwa on Wednesday   evening, sprayed some chemical on her face and allegedly   raped her. €œHe also used the woman's cellphone to click a selfie with her, cropped his image and keyed   in a message threatening her that he would upload the photograph on social media if she disclosed the incident to anyone,�€ deputy commissioner   of police (Zone IV) Rajkumar   Shinde told TOI on Thursday. €œWe have seen the cropped selfie and the message on the survivor's phone after collecting   the gadget,�€ he said. The woman, who has a BE degree in data science, works with an IT firm in Kalyaninagar   and has been staying with her brother (20) in the rented flat since 2022, an office-bearer of the society told TOI . The woman and her brother are from Akola. They shifted to Pune a few years ago for employment. Her brother had gone to Akola, and she was alone at home when the �€œdelivery agent�€ came calling, police said. DCP Shinde said: �€œThe woman   said in her complaint that she responded to the doorbell around 7.15pm and found a man, who claimed to be from a courier firm, waiting. The man told her that he needs to deliver a parcel from a bank. He asked her to acknowledge receipt of the parcel by signing on a delivery sheet he was carrying,   and told her that he had forgotten his pen. When the woman went in to bring the pen, the man seized the moment   to step in and bolted the door from inside before spraying   the chemical on her face. €  The housing society in Kondhwa, where a data   scientist was allegedly raped by a man posing as a delivery agent, is made up of a single 11-storey building divided into 'A', 'B' and 'C' wings. It has a single entrance gate with a security cabin having two guards each in the morning and night shifts and also has an app for community and safety management of the residents. DCP (Zone IV) Rajkumar Shinde said: �€œThe woman regained consciousness around 8.30pm and sensed something wrong was done to her. She alerted her relatives, who, in turn, informed the police. She has been admitted to a govt hospital for medical examination. Our forensic experts will examine what kind of chemical substance the intruder   used to spray on her face. For now, 10 teams have been deployed to arrest the culprit. € Experts visited the crime scene and collected forensic evidence. A spot panchnama was drawn. A dog squad was pressed into service, but it did not pick up the trail of the culprit, police said. €œWe have identified 10 delivery agents from courier and e-commerce firms and food delivery services, who visited the society on Wednesday and are verifying them,�€ said an officer, who is part of the probe. The police have registered a case relating to offences punishable under sections   64 (rape), 77 (voyeurism) and 351(2) (criminal intimidation) of Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita. Pune police commissioner Amitesh Kumar told TOI : �€œWe have collected the survivor's oral and nasal swab to establish the chemical substance   alleged to have been used to render the survivor   unconscious. We have roped in all our re sources considering the nature of the crime. € Preliminary investigation revealed that the intruder did not make an entry in the visitors' register   maintained by the society. €œWe are questioning   the society residents and security guards and also pursuing technical leads to identify, trace and nab the culprit,�€ additional commissioner of police   (Crime) Pankaj Deshmukh said. The guards on duty have so far maintained that there was no entry or exit of any person around the time of the incident nor any outsider has been spotted in CCTV covering the passage leading to the 'A' wing where the survivor stays.

A24H  Gürtel, Púnica, Kitchen y más de veinte causas judiciales sitúan al PP de Feijóo ante la mayor ola de corrupción 20 mayo, 2025 Actualidad 24 Noticias El Partido Popular liderado por Feijóo se enfrenta a 28 procesos judiciales por corrupción con más de 150 cargos implicados El PP acumula 28 juicios por corrupción bajo la dirección de Feijóo con implicaciones históricas para la política española Estos incluyen las macrocausas más mediáticas como Gürtel, Púnica, Lezo, Kitchen, Erial, Novo Carthago, el Campus de la Justicia de Madrid o la desaladora de Escombreras en Murcia, así como otros procedimientos menores. En conjunto, los tribunales han puesto en evidencia la magnitud de la trama: más de 150 cargos públicos del PP están implicados en estos sumarios. Entre ellos figuran ex altos cargos populares como el expresidente Mariano Rajoy (implicado en la llamada Operación Cataluña), el exvicepresidente Rodrigo Rato, la exministra Ana Mato, el exministro de Interior Jorge Fernández Díaz, el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana y varios líderes regionales, como el expresidente murciano Pedro Antonio Sánchez o el exmandatario de Murcia Ramón Luis Valcárcel. La cuantía de las penas solicitadas es enorme: por ejemplo, la Fiscalía pide décadas de cárcel para Rato por fraudes económicos. Calendario judicial de las macrocausas pendientes El calendario judicial de estos procesos se extiende a lo largo de varios años. Entre los hitos ya conocidos destacan: Caso Rato (Audiencia Provincial de Madrid): El exministro Rodrigo Rato fue juzgado entre diciembre de 2023 y mayo de 2024 por delitos fiscales (caso Bankia) y uso indebido de tarjetas (tarjetas Black). Cumplió condena por estas tarjetas y tiene pendiente un juicio por un presunto fraude en la salida a bolsa de Bankia. Caso Erial (Audiencia Provincial de Valencia): En octubre de 2024 se dictó sentencia no firme contra el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana, condenado a 10 años y 5 meses de prisión por blanqueo, cohecho, falsedad documental y prevaricación en la adjudicación de estaciones de ITV (pelotazo de las ITV). Aún puede recurrirse este fallo ante el Tribunal Supremo. Operación Púnica (Audiencia Nacional, Madrid): La pieza principal del caso –el supuesto amaño de contratos de eficiencia energética a la empresa Cofely– tiene fecha de juicio: la vista oral empezará el 7 de abril de 2025 y durará hasta mayo. Se sentarán 37 acusados en el banquillo, incluidos nueve exalcaldes (siete del PP) de Madrid y Extremadura, por la adjudicación irregular de contratos municipales de más de 224 millones de euros. Además de esta pieza, otras diez piezas separadas de Púnica siguen pendientes de juicio. Operación Kitchen (Audiencia Nacional): El tribunal fijó el juicio para mayo-junio de 2026. En este caso se enjuiciará a los exministros del Interior Jorge Fernández Díaz y Francisco Martínez, así como a varios comisarios de Policía por la trama policial ilegal montada en 2013 para espiar al extesorero Luis Bárcenas. La Fiscalía solicita 15 años de cárcel para Fernández Díaz y Martínez. Caso Novo Carthago (Murcia): El proceso por la urbanización ilegal de Novo Carthago, en el que están imputados exconsejeros murcianos, sufrió un aplazamiento judicial. Debido a una huelga de letrados se ha pospuesto la vista oral hasta 2025. Caso Campus de la Justicia (Audiencia Nacional): En septiembre de 2024 la Audiencia Nacional condenó a 7 años de prisión a Alfredo Prada, exconsejero de Justicia de la Comunidad de Madrid en el Gobierno de Esperanza Aguirre, por prevaricación y malversación en contratos amañados del proyecto del Campus Judicial. Cuatro exdirectivos del proyecto recibieron penas menores (3,5 años). Caso Desaladora de Escombreras (Audiencia Provincial de Murcia): El expresidente murciano Ramón Luis Valcárcel enfrenta en julio de 2024 una vista de conformidad que podría evitar el juicio oral. Se le investiga por presuntos delitos de malversación, prevaricación y fraude en la construcción y rescate de la desaladora de Escombreras. La fiscalía pide 11 años de cárcel y fuertes inhabilitaciones. La jueza instructora ordenó en 2023 juicio oral contra Valcárcel tras advertir indicios de delito. Caso Gürtel: Varias piezas de esta trama originada hace años siguen su curso. Por ejemplo, en la pieza 5 (pelotazo Orange Market de los contratos de la Generalitat Valenciana) están pendientes sentencias próximas contra figuras como Francisco Camps. Asimismo, el Supremo debe resolver recursos contra la sentencia de la denominada caja B del PP, que condenó al extesorero Bárcenas. En la Comunidad de Madrid hay otra caja B investigada en una pieza separada del caso Púnica. En conjunto, quedan al menos cuatro causas Gürtel pendientes en distintas fases. Otros casos pendientes: El caso Lezo (gestión de Canal Isabel II) mantiene varias piezas con exconsejeros procesados, aunque aún no se ha fijado fecha de juicio definitiva. También continúan las investigaciones por las irregularidades en las cajas de ahorros (casos Caja B y Bankia) y el rescate de las autopistas radiales, con procesos judiciales abiertos donde el PP figura como responsable civil. Los magistrados Enrique López y Concepción Espejel han sido apartados de varios tribunales debido a sus acusados vínculos con el PP. Estos jueces, que llegaron a ser elegidos con el apoyo popular, habían sido recusados por la Fiscalía y la acusación popular por su “afinidad” al partido. El caso más reciente fue su relevo en el juicio de la financiación ilegal (caja B) del PP. Este tipo de recusaciones ha alimentado críticas de que existe una “instrumentalización de la justicia” con motivaciones políticas. Incluso el presidente Pedro Sánchez denunció públicamente casos de “lawfare” (uso político de la justicia), citando la Operación Kitchen como ejemplo de persecución política contra el PP. Voces de la oposición recalcan que estas estrategias minan la imparcialidad y exigen garantías de neutralidad en los tribunales. En conclusión, la intensa actividad judicial ha convertido al PP de Feijóo en la formación política con más procesos abiertos por corrupción en España. Los 28 juicios por corrupción del PP previstos hasta 2029 marcarán la agenda política y judicial. El partido lo atribuye a casos del pasado anteriores a la actual dirección, mientras sus críticos lo interpretan como la mayor constelación de casos de corrupción en la historia reciente del país.

The plaintiffs in these cases alleged that companies unlawfully used technologies like “session replay” software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The court assessed how CIPA, an older wiretapping law, applies to modern website tracking like session replay and chatbots, focusing on definitions of “interception” and “contents.” A Ninth Circuit court of appeals panel reviewed three separate proposed class actions against Papa John's International Inc., Converse Inc., and Bloomingdale's, all centered on whether certain website tracking activities violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). At the core of these cases is the application of CIPA Section 631, a statute originally enacted to address traditional wiretapping and eavesdropping, to modern website tracking technologies. CIPA Section 631(a) imposes liability on an entity that “intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection . . . with any telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, or willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report or communication while the same is in transit . . . ” The same section also imposes liability on an entity that “aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons” to commit one or more of the aforesaid acts.” The recent surge in CIPA litigation has targeted companies employing these tracking technologies, seeking to recover statutory damages of $5,000 per violation. The Allegations: Website Tracking and the California Invasion of Privacy Act The plaintiffs in these cases allege that companies unlawfully used technologies like “session replay” software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The Lower Court Decisions and the Ninth Circuit's Considerations Papa John's: In Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc., the plaintiff alleged that Papa John's unlawfully eavesdropped and wiretapped by capturing customers' website interactions using tracking software and sent the data to a third-party. The lower court dismissed the case, determining that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege that Papa John's engaged in or aided and abetted wiretapping. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit found, “Thomas alleged that Papa John's directly violated section 631(a) of the California Penal Code by 'eavesdrop[ping] and learn[ing] the content of its users' communications.' But a party to a conversation cannot be liable under section 631 for 'eavesdropping' on its own conversation,” the panel said. “Thomas did not allege that Papa John's violated section 631 by aiding another party in eavesdropping.” Ultimately, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the lower court's dismissal, ruling that Papa John's, as a party to the communications, can't be liable for spying on its own conversation. Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc.. Bloomingdale's: In Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's LLC et al., the plaintiff alleged that Bloomingdale's used session replay code to capture and disclose the “contents” of website communications to a third-party vendor without user consent, violating CIPA Section 631. The district court granted the motion of Bloomingdale motion to dismiss Mikulsky's complaint for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. On appeal, Bloomingdale's argued that masking text fields prevented the vendor from viewing this data, however, the Ninth Circuit panel reversed the lower court's decision finding that the district court erred in dismissing Mikulsky's claim under CIPA section 631(a), finding that the complaint stated sufficient facts to allege that Defendants aided, agreed with, employed, or conspired with Session Replay Code providers to enable the providers to read, attempt to read, or to learn “the contents or meaning of any message, report, or communication while the same [was] in transit or passing over any wire, line, or cable, or [was] being sent from, or received at any place within this state,” without the consent of all parties. The court further found that the complaint alleged real-time capture of the contents of Mikulsky's communications on Defendants' website without her consent, not merely the real-time capture of information regarding the characteristics of the communications. Mikulsky v. Bloomingdales, LLC, et al. Converse: In Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al., the claims revolved around Converse's use of online customer service chat features allowing users to interact with Converse customer service agents through text-based communication directly on its website and whether the communications through these features could be considered analogous to traditional telephone communications covered by CIPA. The district court granted Converse's motion for summary judgment finding that the internet transmissions, specifically the online chat features, were not analogous to traditional telephone communications as covered by CIPA Section 631, finding this clause applies solely to “telephone communications”. The court also found that the chat provider did not engage in wiretapping, as the messages were encrypted in transit and password-protected on the provider's servers, preventing the “willful and without consent” reading of communications as required for CIPA liability. On appeal, during the Ninth Circuit's hearing of oral arguments, Judge Jay S. Bybee expressed concerns about applying a statute adopted in 1967 to modern internet technology, describing it as “very anachronistic”. Judge Baybee suggested that the plaintiff might be better served asserting her claims under a more recent California statute designed to protect consumers' online privacy. The court has yet to rule on the appeal. Gutierrez v. Converse Inc. et al. Key Takeaways: Implications for Businesses The Ninth Circuit's decisions in Thomas v. Papa John's, Mikulsky v. Bloomingdale's, and Gutierrez v. Converse represent a critical moment in the ongoing debate over how existing privacy laws, apply to modern website tracking technologies. Balancing Old Law and New Technology: These cases highlight the ongoing challenge of interpreting and applying older privacy laws to rapidly evolving internet technology. The Ninth Circuit's decisions offer insight into how courts are grappling with these complexities, focusing on the technical specifics of data capture and the specific requirements of CIPA's various clauses. The Ninth Circuit's review allowed it to address key questions about applying CIPA, a law originally focused on telephone wiretapping, to modern internet communications, and what level of consent is required for tracking technologies. The appeals aimed to clarify the scope of CIPA liability for businesses using tracking technologies and to guide courts on how to interpret and apply this older law in the context of rapidly evolving online privacy issues.

The plaintiffs in these cases alleged that companies unlawfully used technologies like “session replay” software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The court assessed how CIPA, an older wiretapping law, applies to modern website tracking like session replay and chatbots, focusing on definitions of “interception” and “contents.” A Ninth Circuit court of appeals panel reviewed three separate proposed class actions against Papa John's International Inc., Converse Inc., and Bloomingdale's, all centered on whether certain website tracking activities violated the California Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA). At the core of these cases is the application of CIPA Section 631, a statute originally enacted to address traditional wiretapping and eavesdropping, to modern website tracking technologies. CIPA Section 631(a) imposes liability on an entity that “intentionally taps, or makes any unauthorized connection . . . with any telegraph or telephone wire, line, cable or instrument of any internal telephonic communication system, or willfully and without the consent of all parties to the communication, or in any unauthorized manner, reads, or attempts to read, or to learn the contents or meaning of any message, report or communication while the same is in transit . . . ” The same section also imposes liability on an entity that “aids, agrees with, employs, or conspires with any person or persons” to commit one or more of the aforesaid acts.” The recent surge in CIPA litigation has targeted companies employing these tracking technologies, seeking to recover statutory damages of $5,000 per violation. The Allegations: Website Tracking and the California Invasion of Privacy Act The plaintiffs in these cases allege that companies unlawfully used technologies like “session replay” software and chatbots to monitor website visitors' interactions, intercepting their information and transmitting it to third parties without consent, thereby violating CIPA Section 631. The Lower Court Decisions and the Ninth Circuit's Considerations Papa John's: In Thomas v. Papa John's International Inc., the plaintiff alleged that Papa John's unlawfully eavesdropped and wiretapped by capturing customers' website interactions using tracking software and sent the data to a third-party. The lower court dismissed the case, determining that the plaintiff failed to sufficiently allege that Papa John's engaged in or aided and abetted wiretapping.

668c52792590814cab983fc99902b859,"  The book Mrs Fitzherbert and Sons is a meticulously researched and deeply human portrait of Maria Fitzherbert , the secret and morganatic wife of George, Prince of Wales (later King George IV ), and the hidden lineage connected to their relationship. Drawing on family records, letters, and historical archives, Philippa and James Foord-Kelcey — descendants of Maria's extended family — explore the life of a woman at the centre of one of the most controversial royal romances in British history. Although their marriage was invalid under the Royal Marriages Act of 1772 — due to her being Catholic and the union lacking the King's consent — it was nonetheless a sacramental bond in the eyes of both parties recognised by the Pope Pius VII , solemnized before God and with deep mutual affection. They raised a family under the pseudonym's Randolph and Ann Jayne Payne at Sulby Hall in Welford The book also delves into the lives of the ""sons"" — those who, while never publicly acknowledged as the biological children of the Prince and Mrs Fitzherbert, were closely associated with her and rumoured by some to be connected by blood. The authors trace these family lines with discretion and insight, presenting the case for a quiet legacy of royal descent outside the official line of succession. What emerges is a poignant narrative of loyalty, sacrifice, and hidden nobility , painting Mrs Fitzherbert not as a scandalous mistress, but as a woman of conscience, dignity, and profound devotion — a loyal subject of the Crown and, arguably, the uncrowned Queen of George's heart. King George IV has often been unfairly slandered by history as a reckless gambler and a profligate spender who squandered the nation's wealth on frivolities. Yet recent research and family accounts reveal a far more nuanced picture. Behind the scenes, George was secretly setting aside funds for his children, carefully safeguarding their future through discreet deposits in Coutts Bank. This act of quiet responsibility contradicts the popular caricature of a spendthrift monarch and instead shows a father deeply concerned for the welfare and security of his offspring, despite the scandals and pressures that surrounded his reign. Far from wasting money thoughtlessly, George IV's hidden generosity reflects a side of the man rarely acknowledged in the public record — one of love, foresight, and paternal care. The book goes into more detail about their sons Randolph and his sons and George Payne the youngest son. They had six children together Julia b.1786 d.1832, William b. 1787 d.1862, Randolph b.1790 d.1862, John b.1795 d.1875, Mary Georgina Emma b.1798 d.1848 and George b.1803 d.1878. Some also claim that that the Mrs Fitzherbert's niece Mary Ann or Marianne b.1807 — who she reared as her own daughter — was in reality her own child rather than the child of her brother John Smythe. If so then she must have been born around 1801 not 1807. One of these Payne sons was William Payne b.1787 was the grandfather of the West family originally from Welford on the border of Northamptonshire and Leicestershire. The West family's journey from England to Australia reflects a fascinating intertwining of loyalty, adventure, and resilience. Settling initially in Corowa and Parkes, New South Wales, the family's passion for horse racing endured across continents — Simeon Levi West famously brought his horse Tradition to compete in the 1888 Melbourne Cup. The family's enthusiasm for racing had deep roots in England; Vincent Payne West, one of the brothers, even lost his job for attending the Newmarket races. Vincent later emigrated to Australia in search of his grandfather, William Payne, who was believed to be living in New South Wales. In fact their grandfather was in Tasmania and it was their uncle William Payne b.1804 (who married Mary Muldoon in Tasmania), the son of William Payne b.1787 that was in NSW, but he had already died by the time the West's arrived. William's life, however, was marked by complexity and controversy. According to Jim and Philippa Foord-Kelcey in Mrs Fitzherbert and Sons , William served as a soldier in the Napoleonic Wars before turning to highway robbery, for which he was convicted and reportedly transported to Australia as a convict, according to some family stories. Some family correspondence suggests William might have been sent as a remittance man under George IV's patronage, while other records place him in Tasmania, where he secondly married Ann Maria Spencer. His son William married Mary Muldoon, a Catholic, and raised a family. By marrying and raising Catholic children, William's line was effectively distanced from posing any threat to the Royal family's succession. The Payne family continued to establish roots in New South Wales, with descendants maintaining their heritage amidst the challenges of exile and reinvention. This layered history reveals how loyalty, stigma, and survival intersected in the lives of those connected — directly or indirectly — to the royal circle, reflecting the broader tensions between crown, faith, and identity in the 19th century. William may have remained in Tasmania , where records show a William Payne who died in 1862 at Oatlands , having fathered a son, James Spencer Payne , with Ann Maria Spencer in 1820. James died in 1886 , also at Oatlands. These details, while fragmentary, hint at a hidden lineage quietly woven into the fabric of the colonies. In this, we glimpse a story of discreet displacement: a life once touched by monarchy, now lived in distant lands under new names, carrying with it the memory of loyalty, scandal, and forgotten legitimacy . The story of William Payne offers a tantalizing and deeply human thread in the shadowed tapestry of royal and colonial history. Born in 1787 at Clapham House, Litlington , he was believed by family tradition to be the eldest son of George IV and Maria Fitzherbert , born out of their secret sacramental union. He grew up at Sulby Hall at Welford with his siblings and the children of George Pearce Payne, said to be a relative of Admiral Jack Payne a close friend of George, when he was Prince of Wales. As a young man, William is said to have secretly married Elizabeth Clarke (the daughter of John Clarke and Caroline Ann Vann) , who bore him a daughter, Mary Ann as well as a son John Payne . In a dramatic family episode, William's guardian — known as Mr. Payne — took the blame for the affair and was killed in a duel by Miss Clarke's brother. Mary Ann was then taken in by the Paine family of Great Houghton, Northamptonshire , and is said to have spent time with her grandmother, Maria Fitzherbert , during her youth. Later, William served as a soldier in the Napoleonic Wars , but upon returning, disillusioned and restless, he allegedly became a highwayman . According to oral tradition, it was George IV himself who arranged for William to be sent to Tasmania — either as a form of exile or remittance. There, in Tasmania, is where his illegitimate son William (by Miss Crofts of Sulby) married Mary Muldoon , a Catholic, and eventually settled in New South Wales , where he worked as both a soldier and an innkeeper until his death in 1840 at Goulburn at the age of 36 . By raising his family as Catholics, any potential claim to royal recognition was quietly erased. Though rarely acknowledged in official records, William Payne's life reflects the complexity of hidden legitimacy , royal discretion, and colonial reinvention — a story of both scandal and sacrifice, lived far from court, yet always beneath its shadow.

1lrqc76,"  Hello dentists, I would like to ask for your advice whether or not I should seek a second opinion. Apparently, some 15-20 years ago someone started a root canal on my #19, broke an instrument inside, never finished the canal, just put a filling on top. This story was revealed to me after x-rays performed by a different dentist 10 years ago, I was shown dark area around the root and told that this tooth can be problematic. However, it never bothered me until recently. Went to a random dentist with some pain and was given a referral to the “endodontist A”. The “endodontist A” could not see me until next month, so I looked at Google reviews (mistake) and went to the “endodontist B”. The “endodontist B” removed the broken instrument and told me that the canals are either calcified or filled with some very hard material by the dentist who worked on that tooth many years ago and that it would take multiple visits to handle them. After some digging during my second visit, she told me the tooth has a fracture and has to be pulled. Honestly, there was a teeny-tiny line visible on one side of the tooth before the endodontic work, but I suspect the “endodontist B” just fractured my tooth with all the manipulations. She put a temporary filling, but I asked to make a more permanent one because I was about to travel. The tooth wasn't happy after this ordeal but calmed down after 10 days on antibiotics and has been doing okay for the last week or so. Now I am out of at least $1000 and wondering what my options are: Should I consult the “endodontist A” for a second opinion? Should I go straight to the oral surgeon? Can this wait a couple of months? Here are post-appointment notes from the “endodontist B”: The clinical and radiographic evaluation revealed symptomatic apical periodontitis in a previously initiated tooth #19. The dis-articulated instrument from the previous attempted treatment of this tooth was removed. The patient returned to my office to complete the root canal treatment. After access opening, a large fracture was seen in the mesial wall of the tooth extending deep into the root. The patient was informed that the prognosis for the tooth is poor and given a referral to an oral surgeon to get the tooth removed. Attached: X-rays before and after treatment; picture of the tooth before the temporary filling at the end of the appointment. ! [img](mmgzavp9lwaf1) ! [img](c9fkssp9lwaf1) !

mov_E32C87268EF83643248C2E3FEFFA10CD,"  Y'all………. . It would seem that we are living in dark and discouraging times. It would seem that it's always a fight and back and forth between conservative and liberal, Democrat and Republican, right vs. left, this religious denomination vs. that religious denomination back and forth, my way or the highway. It would seem that this fight has become a “good vs. bad” type thing. It would seem that there are folks whom some of us respected, admired, and dare I say loved, who have shown themselves to be far different from what our perceptions of them have been. Sometimes I just wanna scream STOP It! Other times it's a quiet “Why can't we all just get along?” More recently, my thoughts have been more like, “What the hell is wrong with you?” I find it exhausting, this push and pull and continuous descension, and I find myself wondering, “What if? Why? How can we stop this madness?” Well, Imma tell ya. We can't. We simply can't stop folks from doing what they're gonna do and being who they've shown to us they actually are. But, as he so often did, Jesus gives us a bit of direction that we can apply here. In the Gospel reading appointed for today,   (Luke 10:1-12, 17-20, often called “The Great Commission,”)  Jesus is telling the twelve disciples what's up, just how they're supposed to proceed with the actually being disciples thing, and what they can expect. And in the middle of this oral handbook he's delivering, he includes this little zinger:  “Whoever will not receive you or listen to your words—go outside that house or town and shake the dust from your feet.” To put a more modern spin on it, in the film “Frozen,” Elsa sings, “Let It Go.” And that's a hard thing to do and it goes against everything that those of us who are/were educators believe. We try desperately to never, ever, give up on our students. We find new and different ways to try to reach them. And sometimes, we find new and different people (specialists) who have a better chance at getting whatever point across to some of these kids. But sometimes, sometimes there are students/kids/folks who are just never gonna get it. Never. And that hurts. But we persevere and keep working with the next batch of folks who are given to us to try to reach. It's what we do. And going right along with that, it's the same with those of us who preach and teach love continually. Some folks are never gonna get it. Some folks just refuse to be reached. And that's heartbreaking. Even Jesus had to learn this lesson the hard way. In Luke 19:41-44, Jesus wept over Jerusalem as He approached the city, knowing that its inhabitants would soon reject Him and face destruction. His weeping highlights Jesus's sorrow for the spiritual blindness and hardness of heart that would lead to their downfall. It also reveals His deep love and concern for the people of Jerusalem, despite their rejection of Him. Ugh. But Jesus kept right on doing what he was doing, and so do we. But I'm gonna let ya in on a little secret. Sometimes, no, actually ALL the time whilst I'm talking about this love stuff that Jesus was so adamant about, I'm also, in many ways, preaching to myself. I have to continually police myself to not fall to the temptation to be a wee bit nasty, mean, hateful, or rude. I love the story Anne Lamott relates “Plan B: Further Thoughts on Faith.” She writes about A.J. Muste, a life-long pacifist who, during the Vietnam War, stood in front of the White House night after night, for years, holding a lighted candle. A one person protest, conducted near the end of his life. One very rainy night, a reporter asked him, “Mr. Muste, do you really think you are going to change the policies of this country by standing out here alone at night with a candle?” “Oh,” Muste replied, “I don't do it to change the country, I do it so the country won't change me.” So we “shake the dust from our sandals” when we have to, and keep going, trying remind ourselves along with everyone else, to spread Jesus's  message of love, of inclusiveness, of joy, of trying to be the (say it with me) the only Jesus some folks will ever see; the only Bible some folks will ever read. And maybe, just maybe, to be that candle in the darkness for someone. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tadZ8nCLBsI&list=RDtadZ8nCLBsI&start_radio=1","Y'all………. .

That is, the passage does not appear to have a source in first-century Judaism  (Jesus's lenient treatment of the woman is in opposition to the expectations of the Jewish people in Jesus's day), nor does it fit in with the early church's emphasis on sexual purity.5 >This criterion of double dissimilarity indicates the M. Metzger declares that the story has all the “earmarks of historical veracity.” 7 Gary Burge points to three aspects that support the authenticity of the passage. These are: Jesus's refusal to be embroiled in the debate over how the death penalty should be carried out and critique of those who would condemn a sinner; Christ's unequivocal stand against the representatives of the Torah; and his unconditional forgiveness of the woman, based solely on his authority. Burge then concludes that the passage represents a “unit of oral tradition,” historically accurate, but not included in the Gospels.8 Its historical authenticity has been recognized by believers throughout the centuries.

n1oibn4,"  Chat gpt got me this: If you're dealing with month-long constipation, that's a serious medical issue. Solving it in 2 days — especially if you're asking for a brutal but effective method — is risky and should only be done under medical supervision, especially if there's a possibility of fecal impaction (which is likely after a month). However, here's the most aggressive but commonly used plan that doctors may employ in hospitals — but again, do not try this without talking to a healthcare provider: ⚠️ EXTREME 2-DAY CONSTIPATION CLEANOUT PLAN (for serious cases) ✅ Step 1: Assess for Fecal Impaction If you feel rock-hard stool in the rectum, can't pass anything at all, and have bloating/pain — you may need manual disimpaction or enemas before anything oral will work. In that case, start with enemas. Day 1: Disimpact and Loosen the Block A. Enema Therapy Use one or more of the following: Microlax (fast acting) Fleet enema (phosphate-based, strong) Mineral oil enema (if hard stool, helps soften) > Repeat every few hours (max 2–3 in a day) until something comes out. B. Oral Osmotic Laxatives (draw water into colon) Start drinking: Polyethylene glycol 3350 (Movicol, MiraLAX) — 17g in 250ml water every hour, up to 8 doses. Optional: Combine with Magnesium citrate 150–300ml once (strong, causes rapid diarrhea). Day 2: Full Cleanout (if stool is moving) C. Stimulant Laxatives Bisacodyl (Dulcolax): 10–20mg orally in the morning. Or: Senna: 2–4 tabs. > These cause colon contractions. Best taken after the stool is softened from PEG/enema. D. Keep Drinking PEG Continue PEG doses (2–4x daily) to cause diarrhea-like flushing. Drink lots of water or electrolyte fluids to avoid dehydration. Optional Add-on: ❄️ Suppository Bisacodyl suppository: 10mg rectally inserted in the morning for rapid response. ⚠️ Important Warnings If nothing comes out after enemas and PEG, and you feel severe pain, vomiting, fever, or bloating, go to the emergency room — you might have a bowel obstruction or megacolon, which is dangerous. Do not do this if you have kidney problems, heart failure, or are very elderly — high magnesium or phosphate can be dangerous. Would you like a shopping list or schedule for this? Or are you considering a hospital visit?","Chat gpt got me this: If you're dealing with month-long constipation, that's a serious medical issue.

Indeed, I think the majority and dissent state this issue with more clarity than in previous cases. Justice Kavanaugh's majority opinion explains: The Appointments Clause in Article II of the Constitution specifies how ""Officers of the United States,"" as distinct from employees, must be appointed. 2, cl. 2. I don't recall seeing the word ""distinct"" used in this context. Here, the Court draws a bright line between an ""Officer of the United States"" and a mere employee. And what is that line? Quoting,Lucia, Justice Kavanaugh explains the line turns on whether the individual exercises ""significant governmental authority."" An officer exercises ""'significant authority pursuant to the lawsof the United States.'"" Lucia v. SEC, 585 U. S. 237, 245 (2018). An employee, by contrast, does not exercise significant governmental authority. See ibid. Justice Kavanaugh does not quite say that employeescannot exercise ""significant authority."" He says theydo notexercise such authority. Still, I think a plausible reading of Justice Kavanaugh dissent is that an employeecannot exercise ""significant authority."" If an employee could exercise ""significant"" authority, then there would not be a distinct line between ""Officer of the United States"" and an ""employee."" Indeed, without this line, Congress could vest unaccountable employees--who are not subject to the Appointments Clause--with this great power. And with great power, comes great responsibility. Stated differently, great power requires great accountability. (I tried to  get this line out during oral argument, but couldn't quite finish.) Further, Justice Kavanaugh reinforces this distinction with his summary of the facts: Before 2010, members of the Preventive Services Task Force were not officers at all. The Task Force was an advisory body, and the Task Force members made only non-binding recommendations. As a result of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, however, the Task Force's ""A"" and ""B"" recommended preventive services now must be covered by health insurers at no cost to the insured. For that reason, the parties here agree that the Task Force members exercise significant governmental authority and qualify as ""officers"" of the United States. They disagree, however, over whether Task Force members are principal or inferior officers. In other words, because the Task Force members exercise ""significant authority,"" they cannot be employees; they must be ""Officers of the United States"" who are appointed pursuant to the Appointments Clause. The majority ultimately holds that the Task Force members are inferior officers. I don't quibble with that holding here. Justice Thomas's dissent draws the same distinction between ""Officers of the United States"" and employees: The Clause prescribes the exclusive means of appointing ""'Officers of the United States.'"" Lucia v. SEC, 585 U. S. 237, 244 (2018). Officers are Government officials who exercise ""'significant'"" federal authority on an ""ongoing"" basis. Id., at 245-246. Those who do not exercise such authority are mere nonofficer employees and are not subject to the Clause's requirements. Id., at 245. [FN1] [FN1] The parties agree that the exercise of ""significant authority"" marks the dividing line between officers and nonofficer employees.

Again, I would read the Thomas dissent to support the proposition that employees cannot exercise ""significant authority."" Were Congress to vest a position with such power, that position must be filled under the auspices of the Appointments Clause.

However, effective cleaning – tooth brushing twice a day, with the removable of debris from interproximal spaces – isn't easy for some patients. Dexterity is something that many people may take for granted, but for those that cannot clean their dentition with ease, their clinician is a primary source of support. Dental professionals need to be aware of prominent dexterity issues, and how they may affect a wide array of patients. They should also understand the aspects of an oral hygiene routine that can be most difficult, and identify opportunities to use alternative oral hygiene adjuncts. Making a connection Hand dexterity is the ability to perform small, precise hand movements with flow and accuracy. [i] Some studies differentiate manual ability and manual dexterity, with the latter describing the proficiency of the skill to perform a manual task depending on factors such as cognition. [ii] Complications may be seen throughout the entirety of an oral hygiene routine. Take the use of traditional dental floss as an example. A patient needs to take floss from a dispenser, which uses unilateral or bilateral gross motor movement of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, and fingers; then onto the action of flossing itself, they require fine motor control with manual dexterity of the arms, hands and fingers once more. [iii] Studies have shown that manual dexterity is linked to the effectiveness of dental flossing,iii and some that focus on patients in residential homes have found that manual dexterity can be connected to the amount of dental plaque present.ii Where more plaque is present, patients are more likely to develop periodontal infections, which can be severely damaging in the long term. Patients affected Causes for limited dexterity vary, but one of the most well-known connections is age. This, alongside grip strength, is a significant predictor of hand dexterity. [iv] Maintaining oral health into old age is paramount, as tooth loss can be severely detrimental to general health. Edentulism, which may come from periodontal disease, impacts mastication and makes bolus formation difficult, which creates dysfunctional swallowing. This may lead to a change in diet, and an avoidance of harder foods such as meat, fruits or vegetables, which can lead to malnutrition. [v] The effects of malnutrition include an increase in severity of oral infections.v Rheumatoid arthritis is another potential cause for concern. It is the most common inflammatory arthritis and affects around 1% of the UK population,[vi] with women under 50 around four to five times more likely to be affected by men – though this disparity diminishes with age. [vii] As well as changes to systemic immune function, rheumatoid arthritis can cause physical impairment, most frequently affecting the wrist, proximal interphalangeal joint (middle of each finger) and the metacarpophalangeal joints (knuckles). vii This complicates oral hygiene routines, especially those that utilise traditional dental floss. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis are found to have a greater risk of periodontal disease.vii Other causes for limited dexterity may include cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and stroke. [viii] These may appear in a patient's medical history, or the individual could volunteer the information during an appointment. Engaging in a discussion around the difficulties faced when performing an oral hygiene routine can then help clinicians recommend the right alternatives for a patient's needs. Recommending alternatives Powered toothbrushes have been recommended in the literature for individuals with decreased manual dexterity, owing to an improved action and control over tooth cleaning. [ix] By implementing this solution, the research even states that any individual can use good brushing technique, and experience greater plaque removal and improvement to gingival health, irrespective of manual dexterity. Water flossers have also been recommended for patients lacking manual dexterity[x] as an alternative to traditional flossing, and should still be used alongside tooth brushing. Patients can disrupt plaque and debris with jets of water, using the different pressure options typically available, and they are also able to target bacteria beneath the gingival margin. Patients should be sure to choose high-quality and clinically proven adjuncts above all else. Clinicians can recommend those from Waterpik™, the only water flosser brand to be approved by the Oral Health foundation. With an easy-to-use oral hygiene solution in the Waterpik™ Cordless Advanced water flosser, patients can remove up to 99.9% of plaque from treated areas in just three seconds.

This milestone payment follows the successful settlement of the second tranche of €115.6 million1 in gross proceeds (net proceeds of €108.5 million) of the previously announced structured financing of up to €348 million2 (the “Structured Financing”). In September 2022, Inventiva entered into a licensing and collaboration agreement with CTTQ (as amended on October 11, 2024, the “CTTQ License Agreement”) to develop and commercialize lanifibranor, Inventiva's proprietary compound, for the treatment of MASH and potentially other metabolic diseases in Mainland China, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Macau Special Administrative Region and Taiwan. Under the CTTQ License Agreement, Inventiva is eligible to receive up to an additional $265 million of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestone payments, as well as royalties in the low single digits on annual net sales of lanifibranor, if approved. Based on the results from the Phase 2b NATIVE clinical trial, lanifibranor was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for MASH by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in October 2020 and by the Chinese National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) in December 2023. This designation could potentially accelerate the development and regulatory review of drug candidates for serious or life-threatening conditions. CTTQ joined Inventiva's ongoing NATiV3 pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, which includes over 60 sites across mainland China. Furthermore, CTTQ has completed a Phase I bridging study and confirmed no significant ethnic differences, thereby paving the way to seek regulatory approval in China based on the results of the NATiV3 trial. About Inventiva Inventiva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the research and development of oral small molecule therapies for the treatment of patients with MASH. The Company is currently evaluating lanifibranor, a novel pan-PPAR agonist, in the NATiV3 pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial for the treatment of adult patients with MASH, a common and progressive chronic liver disease.

n1wvrf1,"  So… your second paragraph kind of… stressed me out as it just spreads misinformation. The Greek Bronze Age didn't really write things down -mythologically- they kept a writing form in later Bronze Age something called Linear B and it was primarily used administratively. It was not overly complex but it was used for tracking goods and people during the palatial period. None of the “myths” were written down in story or legend at that time… they gave some references to some gods only when they were listing offerings given to them. While it's possible there was a more complex writing system that simply didn't survive we have not found any evidence of that… Instead the other slightly earlier writing system Linear A, for example, has far fewer inscriptions left, so not all of it con be deciphered, but what has been deciphered was essentially that it was also used for lists -even simpler ones than Linear B. Then there's the Cretan Heiqoglyohics which were only a hundred years or so older than Linear A, and contemporary with Linear A for a while until they were replaced with Linear B (more or less) and as it stands the Cretan Heiroglyphics are undeciphered to this day. Also, the Greeks didn't stop writing things down during the dark ages per se. There are many things that contributed to the collapse of the Bronze Age in Greece and began the “dark ages” but that's sort of broad way to describe the recovery from the collapse of the Bronze Age into the Iron Age. The palaces were destroyed, commerce was non-existent… but in some places communities were intact and in many cases there were new buildings. Then there was a large increase in population and many new expansive buildings were built on top of the destroyed palaces. It was during this time (and likely in the Bronze Age) that bards and poets kept track of the past with poems and hymns as we know them as oral histories, these are cultural memory. But something miraculous happened. They adopted the Phoenician alphabet. Because while Greece was recovering from the collapse, the Phoenicians started expanding westward at about the same time. Then Hesiod wrote the Theogeny, and either a person or a group of people under the pseudonym Homer, wrote the Iliad and the Odyssey. They were documenting the oral history that had been told to them.

mov_290DD233CE2452783E1C50741757AE96,"  LAUSANNE, Switzerland, July 08, 2025     Comphya SA, a clinical-stage MedTech company pioneering the first implantable neurostimulation therapy for erectile dysfunction (ED) unresponsive to medication, today announced the closing of an oversubscribed Series A financing round. Including the conversion of existing convertible loans, the round brings Comphya's total equity raised to CHF 7.5 million (~USD 8.4 million). “We are thrilled to have the continued confidence of our investors, which enables us to accelerate our mission to bring a transformative solution to men living with erectile dysfunction following treatment for prostate cancer,” said Pim van Wesel, CEO of Comphya. “With our U.S. pilot study underway and preparations beginning for a pivotal clinical trial, we're entering an important new chapter in our development.” Proceeds from the Series A will be used to: Launch and execute a U.S. pilot study, with the first site activated at Johns Hopkins following FDA Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) approval announced in January 2025. Prepare for a pivotal U.S. clinical trial planned for 2026, including regulatory and operational groundwork. Expand Comphya's ongoing clinical trial in Australia, where early data has shown strong safety and efficacy signals by recruiting additional patients. The funding comes on the heels of highly encouraging clinical results from the company's first-in-human study in Australia, where patients undergoing robotic-assisted prostatectomy were implanted with Comphya's CaverSTIM™ system. Results presented at the 2025 American Urological Association (AUA) Annual Meeting in Las Vegas showed that a large majority of patients maintained good erectile function postoperatively without the need for adjunctive therapies. No infections or adverse events were reported. These early outcomes underscore the potential of CaverSTIM™ to fill a major gap in post-prostatectomy care, an area with no effective therapeutic options today. The U.S. pilot study, now underway at Johns Hopkins, builds on the strong early data from Australia. Combined insights from both regions will guide the design of a pivotal clinical trial in 2026, which Comphya plans to fund through a forthcoming Series B round. The Series A round also coincides with recent leadership changes at Comphya, including the appointment of industry veteran Pim van Wesel as CEO in May 2025 to guide the company through its next stage of clinical growth and strategic execution. Comphya's neurostimulator system is the first implantable therapy designed to restore natural erectile function by stimulating the cavernous nerves. Founded in 2017 as a spin-off from EPFL in Lausanne, the company aims to redefine the standard of care for patients who do not respond to conventional therapies. About CaverSTIM™ CaverSTIM™ is the first implantable neurostimulator designed to restore erectile function. This innovative technology is primarily intended for patients who are non-responders to oral medications, such as post- prostatectomy patients. CaverSTIM™ is a neurostimulation system composed of an implantable pulse generator (IPG) containing a rechargeable battery and electronics responsible for generating the electrostimulation signal. It is connected to an array of two electrodes (with multiple individual electrodes) to be implanted in the pelvic cavity, where they will activate and restore the nerves responsible for penile erection. The IPG is implanted subcutaneously in the lower abdomen and is remotely operated by external controllers. The clinician controller allows the medical expert to adjust and tailor the system parameters to best suit each patient. The patient controller enables the patient to activate the device and deliver electrical stimulation to the cavernous nerves with the aim of restoring their function. About Comphya SA Comphya is a medical device company based in Lausanne, Switzerland, developing CaverSTIM™, the first implantable device to restore erectile function in patients non-responsive to oral drugs. Today, these patients resort to intrapenile injections or penile implants, the only available yet painful, problematic, and outdated therapies. Comphya's patented solution offers a unique and superior treatment for erectile dysfunction. The company's goal is to offer physiological sexual function and quality of life to large parts of the male population in great need.

If the immune system can't clear it effectively T-Cells can overreact and lead to immune responses and post infectious sequelae like Guttate Psoriasis and PANDAS (Paediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorder Associated with Infection) **Group A Streptococcus (GAS)** 5-20% of children are chronic GAS carriers. Perhaps I was, explaining the yearly tonsillitis? GAS can form biofilms in tonsil crypts making them resist immune clearance. This is linked with psoriasis exacerbation. GAS proteins resemble human proteins, particularly keratin. Others include M Protein, Streptococcal Pyrogenic Exotoxins, GAS Enolase, Streptolysin O, DNase B. These have been linked with the following diseases: Rheumatic heart disease, PANDAS, Psoriasis, Neuroinflammation, Autoimmune Arthritis, ME/CFS. It's possible a chronic GAS infection is exhausting my immune system / T/B-Cells. Maybe it's not the primary player but taking it out (if it is even there) could swing my system around toward recovery. There is also evidence that it can cause the reactivation of EBV. Tonsillectomy does help with psoriasis proving chronic GAS is producing autoimmunity and T-Cell issues. **Testing** To test this I would need an anti streptolysin test (ASO titer). I have asked the GP based on my low positive result from years ago but pretty much been blown off. It's understandable, there are many reasons why someone might test low positive in a random one off ASO titer. I just think it's worth perusing based on my chronic tonsilitis as a child, the infection that triggered my POTS and Chronic Bounding Pulse was likely Strep Throat, I developed what looks like it could be Guttate Psoriasis soon after this (which is caused by Strep, and I still have the possible psoriasis 14 years later), and the only time I have had an ASO titer was several years after onset, when I wasn't ill with tonsilitis, and it came back low positive (as it would in chronic strep colonization cases). There are a number of problems with this theory. It might not be Psoriasis, I may have caught an asymptomatic strep infection at the time of the test, Strep throat may not have been responsible at onset of illness. I might have strep and it might be causing my psoriasis but it's just being opportunistic as my body / immune system is weakened through over means. and if I get rid of the strep it might have no impact on my POTS / CBP. Still I think there is like a 25% chance it exists and is having some impact on my chronic symptoms and like a 5% chance it's the cause of all my problems. I could get this test privately, prices range from £100-200. There is also a home kit you can order for £25, you take your blood at home then send it off to them? The websites not very clear on how that works. I could also see a skin specialist to see if they could identify the psoriasis as Guttate. The GP has indicated an unwillingness to go down that route. **Treatment** I could always to straight to treatment and see if I improve. Tonsillectomy if off the cards but there are other treatments: *1. Targeted Antibiotics* Clindamycin: Effective against GAS and Biofilms. Penicillin + Rifampin: Rifampin penetrates biofilms. This supposedly has a high success rate. Need to look into it further. *2.

1lv1svs,"  NAD. Here is some background. 33 year old female. I drink regular soda and coffee occasionally. I very rarely drink beer and do not smoke. I brush 2x per day - using a manual toothbrush in the morning and an oral B OS electric toothbrush at night. I use Sensodyne and a prescription toothpaste for cavity prevention and sensitivity (dentist told me to add a little of each to my brush head). I use Act mouthwash in the morning and Listerine at night prior to brushing. My flossing ebbs and flows. I have flossed every day for the last month and a half otherwise it was a few times a week prior to that. I had braces from 18-20ish years old. I have a permanent bottom retainer on my front teeth. I have a clear retainer, like Invisalign, for my top teeth. I used to have one for the bottom teeth after a few crowns and fillings it didn't fit so I stopped wearing it. I was never told when or for how long to use my top retainer so I did stop wearing it regularly at night and would only use it for a week every few months. I have used it every day for the last month and a half at the recommendation of my dentist and it fits fine. It was a little snug at first but slips right in and out now. My most recent dentist appointment was about 1.5 months ago. It was with a different dentist at my same dental office. They noticed my top front teeth are loose with the two center teeth being worse. I've noticed too. My bottom front teeth hit the back of the top front teeth when I bite down. They have always done that even prior to braces. For YEARS (decades) I have clenched my teeth (anxiety). I have tried to stop and can't. I relax my jaw when I notice I'm doing it. They said it's loose ligaments from my bottom teeth hitting the back of my top teeth and told me to wear my retainer, brush, and floss because I am much more likely to get an infection and lose my teeth. She seemed accusatory and judgmental with the way she communicated about this issue like I take bad care of my teeth. The first thing she noted on my exam was demineralization “from when I had my braces.” That's flat out wrong. ALL white spots on my teeth are from when I was younger many years before I had my braces. I took ridiculously good care of my teeth when I had braces and feel like I still do despite occasionally slipping on flossing and clenching my teeth. While my teeth look nice in photos they have never been “healthy.” I've been told I have weak enamel since I was in early grade school. I had to go to the hospital to have teeth extracted when I was in grade school. Constant cavities when I was younger. I have had maybe 3 cavities since I've been in my teens. The more I write about this the more frustrated I am with my recent dentist appointment. My dad has had dentures since his early 50s. My brother has dentures since 35. My mom was starting to lose teeth and had a bridge in her early 50s but has passed away. I'm terrified of my teeth deteriorating. I try really hard with my teeth so I can have them as long as possible. I am scared of teeth pain. The dentist gives me anxiety. I go twice a year. Really I guess I would just like some recommendations about how to prevent or reverse the loose front teeth. I feel like I'm so vigilant with them so it's really discouraging when I feel like what I do isn't enough or that the dentist doesn't trust me when I tell them how well I try to care for my teeth.

I have flossed every day for the last month and a half otherwise it was a few times a week prior to that. I had braces from 18-20ish years old. I have a permanent bottom retainer on my front teeth. I have a clear retainer, like Invisalign, for my top teeth. I used to have one for the bottom teeth after a few crowns and fillings it didn't fit so I stopped wearing it. I was never told when or for how long to use my top retainer so I did stop wearing it regularly at night and would only use it for a week every few months. I have used it every day for the last month and a half at the recommendation of my dentist and it fits fine. It was a little snug at first but slips right in and out now. My most recent dentist appointment was about 1.5 months ago. It was with a different dentist at my same dental office. They noticed my top front teeth are loose with the two center teeth being worse. I've noticed too. My bottom front teeth hit the back of the top front teeth when I bite down. They have always done that even prior to braces. For YEARS (decades) I have clenched my teeth (anxiety). I have tried to stop and can't. I relax my jaw when I notice I'm doing it. They said it's loose ligaments from my bottom teeth hitting the back of my top teeth and told me to wear my retainer, brush, and floss because I am much more likely to get an infection and lose my teeth. She seemed accusatory and judgmental with the way she communicated about this issue like I take bad care of my teeth. The first thing she noted on my exam was demineralization “from when I had my braces.” That's flat out wrong. ALL white spots on my teeth are from when I was younger many years before I had my braces. I took ridiculously good care of my teeth when I had braces and feel like I still do despite occasionally slipping on flossing and clenching my teeth. While my teeth look nice in photos they have never been “healthy.” I've been told I have weak enamel since I was in early grade school. I had to go to the hospital to have teeth extracted when I was in grade school.

n246zfv,"  It was a miracle for me, but here's a different spit trick im sure others do but for those who dont know it, it'll screw the drug companies out of a little money as long as you can handle it: After the pill dissolves, it still tastes like medicine, right? That's cuz there's a LOT of medicine in that saliva you've been swallowing or spitting into the sink. Instead, reuse it. Yup. Sounds gross, but in the A.M., use mint listerene. That brand or its generic. Not scope, not oral B, not listermint....MINT LISTERINE. It kills 99.9% of all bacteria. Half hour later (roughly) take your 1st dose, and as it dissolves, spit a bit at a time into an empty pill bottle. After you're done, the entire pill's worth of saliva should be in that bottle. Then pop it in the fridge. This way, you can reuse it as your second dose of the day - you'll just need to sip half at a time and leave it in your mouth longer. 20 - 30 minutes each half. I know it sounds gross but its ur own practically bacteria free saliva. There's still a ton of medicine in that saliva, that would normally go to waste. Another trick: use a toothbrush or your teeth to kind of roughen the surface of the inside of your cheek, and even under your tongue - this creates more surface area and disturbed capillaries which will allow more of the medication to be absorbed. Then at dinner time, do the listerene again & take your third dose of the day which is only your second pill and again spit that into a bottle which you can use later that night before you go to bed, at 3a. m. if you need it, or first thing in the morning. The idea is that we're trying to use two pills a day instead of three. Yes, I know. This sounds gnarly, but this shit is expensive, and if you've used the list ring like, I've told you there shouldn't be much bacteria if any at all in there. And if you've put it in the fridge, you've retarded the growth of that bacteria, hell, you could even freeze it. It only takes about 10 minutes. In a warm hand melt it. You could even put it in the freezer and leave it there in case at a later date & you are running low, you'll have some in the freezer that's been frozen, still good. If it dries up back into powder, add some hot water and shake it up.Good as new! The key is that we're trying to use less. Then start tapering down. Let's say you get 90 pills a month which is what I got. I used to get 3 bottles of 30 pills. I did 3 per day like that for a year and then decided to taper down. The first taper, was instead of taking a full pill with my brand new prescription, i dropped to 3/4 of 1 pill for the entire 1st bottle of 30. So effectively going from 8 mg to 6 mg, it's virtually imperceptible. Do that for the entire 1st bottle. 2nd bottle, as best you can, try to break a pill into thirds or get a medicine scale at Amazon for $10 and weigh it out. In ounces, 1 pill will measure .4oz, so its easy. So now you're getting 3 equal pieces and take 2/3 of a pill for the entire second bottle, so just over 5mg. Imperceptible. Each step i lay out is SO gradual so as to be unnoticeable. Your third bottle, go to half a pill, 4mg. Again, virtually imperceptible. So this fill, instead of lasting 30 days, the first bottle will last about 13 days, the 2nd bottle about 15 days, and the 3rd 20 days, so in total this fill will last about 45-48 days. Your doc will love you. This is a huge trust builder, too. Don't say youre tapering Tell him/her ""Im trying to take them only when I really need to!"" Then the next refill, when you get your next prescription of 90 pills, the 1st bottle of 30 go to a third of a pill. Just under 3mg. Second bottle, go from a third of a pill to a quarter of a pill, 2mg, and the 3rd bottle, break a quarter pill in half as best u can - roughly 1 mg. By now, you may be skipping doses....","It was a miracle for me, but here's a different spit trick im sure others do but for those who dont know it, it'll screw the drug companies out of a little money as long as you can handle it: After the pill dissolves, it still tastes like medicine, right?

mov_F990722929A31795AE5C9566F1E9F88A,"  Optimism Surrounding the New Earnings Season As we approach a new earnings season, there are numerous reasons to feel hopeful about the economy's trajectory. While challenges remain, many investors are strategically considering their next steps amidst these uncertainties. The expectation for many companies in the S&P 500 is an average year-over-year earnings growth of 5%. This projection carries both good and bad news. The encouraging news is that growth expectations have seen positive changes recently, particularly in the technology sector. Yet, the anticipated growth rate appears considerably slower compared to previous years. A significant factor influencing this deceleration is companies' wait for definitive updates regarding tariffs. Although the situation is becoming clearer, accurate forecasting remains a challenge for analysts and investors until all numbers are finalized. The Appeal of Blue-Chip Companies In light of this uncertainty, investors may find safety in large-cap, blue-chip companies. These firms are characterized by robust balance sheets, reliable cash flows, and significant pricing power. Here are three blue-chip stocks that not only benefit from positive growth trends and effective management but are also predicted to exceed overall market earnings growth in the latter half of 2025. 1. Alphabet: A Resilient Tech Powerhouse Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) has recently faced challenges, underperforming compared to some of its peers in the tech sector. A main concern is the influence of generative AI on its search operations. This narrative will unfold over several years. However, in its recent quarterly earnings report, Alphabet showcased a remarkable 12% increase in revenue year-over-year, alongside a 49% surge in earnings per share (EPS). This robust growth was evident across all service divisions, notably through the rising popularity of YouTube. Crucially, the company's Google Cloud division continues to gain momentum, outperforming major competitors such as Amazon and Microsoft in terms of revenue growth rates. Alphabet is also pursuing cutting-edge initiatives including autonomous driving technology via Waymo, developing AI chips, and venturing into quantum computing. Moreover, the company has committed to a significant share buyback program, further enhancing its financial appeal. Analysts project a consensus price target of approximately $199.95 for GOOGL, indicating an upside of about 13%. This figure aligns closely with EPS growth projections of around 14.8%, proving its valuation attractive with a forward earnings ratio around 20x. 2. Eli Lilly: A Leader Amid Rising Competition Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) emerged as one of the standout performers in the previous year, thanks to a select group of stocks riding a bullish wave. As the landscape broadens, LLY appears well-positioned for further growth. With its successful GLP-1 drugs, including Mounjaro and Zepbound, Eli Lilly has established a lead in the pharmaceutical sector. The company is also developing an oral formulation of these treatments to address unmet patient needs. Investors should keep an eye on Eli Lilly's expansive pipeline, which encompasses prospective medications for Alzheimer's and cancer treatments—segments that are expected to flourish over the next decade. After peaking in the previous year, LLY stock has seen a decline of approximately 15%. Nevertheless, since reporting impressive quarterly earnings, showing year-over-year revenue and EPS growth of 45% and 29%, respectively, LLY has rebounded nearly 7%. Analysts anticipate earnings growth exceeding 34% next year, with a consensus price target of $1,012, suggesting potential gains of over 31%. While LLY is trading at a premium compared to the overall market, it remains undervalued against its historical averages. 3. JPMorgan: A Steady Choice for Secure Investments Bank stocks are often viewed as stable, and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) is no exception. With a breathtaking total return exceeding 256% over the last five years, JPMorgan proves that stability can lead to exceptional results. The banking sector has thrived on higher interest rates, contributing to substantial increases in net interest income. However, the market remains cautious as expectations of lower rates in the near future circulate. Regardless of interest rate movements, JPMorgan's solid balance sheet positions it favorably. Should rates decrease, the bank could experience increased loan demand with minimized default risk. Among the discussed stocks, JPM is projected to have the slowest earnings growth at about 7.2%, still surpassing the S&P average. This trend is common within bank stocks. Additionally, potential investors should consider the dividend yield, which stands at an appealing 1.92%. Frequently Asked Questions What are the main themes discussed in the article?

mov_CF16D484CFC69ED8B41E890DF4167E9D,"  ABU DHABI (ALETIHAD) SEHA, a subsidiary of PureHealth, the largest healthcare group in the Middle East, has announced the remarkable progress of a three-year-old patient, Nasser, at Salma Rehabilitation Hospital. Nasser was diagnosed with a spinal cord injury and required complete support for all activities of daily living upon his arrival. He had limited movement, particularly in his left upper limb, and minimal verbal communication. Nasser's rehabilitation journey reflects the significant difference that multidisciplinary care can make in paediatric recovery. From the moment he was admitted to Salma Rehabilitation Hospital, he received comprehensive care from a specialised team including physicians, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, speech and language therapists, and educators. Dr. Ashraf Elbatal, Consultant Pediatrician-Clinical Lead, Salma Rehabilitation Hospital, stated: “Nasser, diagnosed with genetic muscular conditions and reliant on mechanical ventilation 24/7, continues to inspire us. Despite the complexity of his case, he remains full of life, supported by a clinical plan tailored to manage his symptoms and improve his quality of life.” Upon admission, Nasser exhibited muscle weakness, lacked head and trunk control, and was entirely dependent for mobility and self-care. Through intensive therapy, his physical abilities began to improve. He developed better control of his head and trunk, and now sits upright with supervision, uses a wheelchair independently, and can briefly stand with support. Kristopher B. Bantilan, Physiotherapist, commented: “Nasser's cheerful disposition and resilience were evident during therapy. Each session reflected his growing strength, particularly in trunk control, and his enthusiasm motivated all who worked with him.” Occupational therapy contributed significantly to Nasser's independence. Previously fully dependent, he now feeds himself using both hands. “This progress brings him closer to his personal goal of attending school,” said Deidre Diane Karfor, Occupational Therapist. “Nasser can now sit with his peers at break time, feeding himself independently.” His communication also improved significantly. Initially limited to minimal Arabic and struggling with feeding, Nasser has progressed in both oral motor function and language skills. Targeted therapy enhanced his Arabic and introduced English to prepare him for school. Feeding therapy addressed sensory aversions, expanded his diet, and promoted healthy weight gain. Raadiya Rafiek Mohamed, Speech and Language Therapist, noted: “Nasser's language acquisition has been outstanding. From using a single word to now communicating fluently in both Arabic and English, he has shown extraordinary engagement. His feeding milestones have likewise improved, with a broader acceptance of textures and flavours.” Salma's educational team identified Nasser's academic potential and integrated him into formal schooling. Jonathan Gianan, Education and Recreation Lead, stated: “Developing Nasser's Individualised Education Plan was a milestone towards his reintegration. At Salma, our commitment to inclusion and quality of life remains paramount.” Nasser's story highlights the transformative power of interdisciplinary paediatric rehabilitation. From total dependency, he has become a confident and communicative young child, demonstrating resilience, engagement, and remarkable progress. With continued support, Nasser's future remains full of promise.","ABU DHABI (ALETIHAD) SEHA, a subsidiary of PureHealth, the largest healthcare group in the Middle East, has announced the remarkable progress of a three-year-old patient, Nasser, at Salma Rehabilitation Hospital.

Dr. Ashraf Elbatal, Consultant Pediatrician-Clinical Lead, Salma Rehabilitation Hospital, stated: “Nasser, diagnosed with genetic muscular conditions and reliant on mechanical ventilation 24/7, continues to inspire us. Despite the complexity of his case, he remains full of life, supported by a clinical plan tailored to manage his symptoms and improve his quality of life.” Upon admission, Nasser exhibited muscle weakness, lacked head and trunk control, and was entirely dependent for mobility and self-care. Through intensive therapy, his physical abilities began to improve. He developed better control of his head and trunk, and now sits upright with supervision, uses a wheelchair independently, and can briefly stand with support. Kristopher B. Bantilan, Physiotherapist, commented: “Nasser's cheerful disposition and resilience were evident during therapy. Each session reflected his growing strength, particularly in trunk control, and his enthusiasm motivated all who worked with him.” Occupational therapy contributed significantly to Nasser's independence. Previously fully dependent, he now feeds himself using both hands. “This progress brings him closer to his personal goal of attending school,” said Deidre Diane Karfor, Occupational Therapist. “Nasser can now sit with his peers at break time, feeding himself independently.” His communication also improved significantly. Initially limited to minimal Arabic and struggling with feeding, Nasser has progressed in both oral motor function and language skills. Targeted therapy enhanced his Arabic and introduced English to prepare him for school. Feeding therapy addressed sensory aversions, expanded his diet, and promoted healthy weight gain. Raadiya Rafiek Mohamed, Speech and Language Therapist, noted: “Nasser's language acquisition has been outstanding. From using a single word to now communicating fluently in both Arabic and English, he has shown extraordinary engagement. His feeding milestones have likewise improved, with a broader acceptance of textures and flavours.” Salma's educational team identified Nasser's academic potential and integrated him into formal schooling. Jonathan Gianan, Education and Recreation Lead, stated: “Developing Nasser's Individualised Education Plan was a milestone towards his reintegration. At Salma, our commitment to inclusion and quality of life remains paramount.” Nasser's story highlights the transformative power of interdisciplinary paediatric rehabilitation. From total dependency, he has become a confident and communicative young child, demonstrating resilience, engagement, and remarkable progress. With continued support, Nasser's future remains full of promise.",2025-07-09 12:14:00,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The provided text is a detailed medical story about a young patient's rehabilitation journey and does not contain any mention of Oral-B or oral care products.

mov_35AA256E59751DEBCBDB13BD55AF863B,"  Background Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by localized telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations, caused by mutations in genes such as ACVRL1 and ENG. The global prevalence of HHT is estimated to be approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals.1 Previous research has shown that its molecular mechanisms are closely linked to the BMP9/10 signaling pathway.2 In contrast, moyamoya disease (MMD) is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by the progressive narrowing of intracranial arteries and the formation of abnormal collateral vessels. MMD has a higher prevalence in East Asian populations, but the prevalence in China is lower than in other East Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea, with a rate of 1.01 per 100,000 people.3 RNF213, the major susceptibility gene for MMD, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase critical for angiogenesis and vascular remodeling.4 Although these diseases have distinct clinical manifestations, both involve abnormalities in vascular development and remodeling. Their coexistence in a single patient is exceptionally rare. This study presents the first reported case of HHT coexisting with MMD, providing insights into the potential synergistic interaction between ACVRL1 and RNF213 genetic variants and their role in complex hereditary vascular diseases. Case Presentation The patient, a 45-year-old female, presented with a six-year history of recurrent bilateral epistaxis that had worsened over the past year. Six years ago, she began experiencing spontaneous bilateral nosebleeds without any apparent triggers. These episodes were recurrent but resolved spontaneously. Over the past year, the frequency of epistaxis increased to 2–3 episodes per week, with poor response to repeated electrocautery treatments. Symptoms were aggravated by actions such as bending forward or exertion. Physical examination revealed scattered red, pinpoint telangiectasia on the face, oral mucosa, and fingertips. Nasal endoscopy showed classic “rose petal-like” vascular telangiectasia in the nasal mucosa bilaterally (Figure 1A–D). The patient denied neurological symptoms such as headache or dizziness and had no history of trauma or surgery. Family history was notable for her son having occasional nosebleeds, while her parents were healthy. She reported no history of hypertension, diabetes, or other chronic illnesses. Figure 1 Clinical, Radiological, and Genetic Findings in a Patient with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and Moyamoya Disease. (A) Telangiectasia on the tongue mucosa. (B) Telangiectasia on the skin of the fingertips. (C and D) Nasal endoscopy showing characteristic telangiectasia (“rose petal-like” appearance) on the nasal mucosa. (E) Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealing reduced distal branches of the bilateral anterior and middle cerebral arteries, with abnormal small collateral vessels, consistent with moyamoya disease. (F and G). Telangiectasia observed on the gastric mucosa during endoscopy. (H) Pedigree of the proband's family. The arrow indicates the proband (the patient), black symbols represent HHT-positive individuals, and slashed symbols indicate deceased family members. (I) Sanger sequencing results of the proband and her son. Red arrows indicate the identified genetic variants: ACVRL1 c.1231C>T in the proband and RNF213 c.13685C>T in both the proband and her son. Auxiliary Examinations Laboratory tests revealed a hemoglobin level of 83 g/L and an elevated reticulocyte count (85.9 × 10^9/L), indicating moderate anemia with compensatory bone marrow hyperplasia. Coagulation parameters and biochemical markers were within normal limits. Gastrointestinal endoscopy identified multiple sites of Telangiectasia (Figure 1F and G). Brain MRI and MRA (Figure 1E) showed a marked reduction in distal branches of the bilateral anterior and middle cerebral arteries, along with scattered small vascular networks, consistent with the typical imaging features of MMD. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in the ACVRL1 gene (c.1231C>T, p.Arg411Trp) and a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance in the RNF213 gene (c.13685C>T, p.Pro4562Leu) (Figure 1I). Bioinformatic analysis suggested a high likelihood of pathogenicity for the RNF213 variant, with a CADD_phred score of 18.2 and a REVEL score of 0.146 (Table 1). Based on clinical manifestations, imaging findings, and genetic testing, the patient was diagnosed with HHT 2 coexisting with moyamoya disease. Table 1 Bioinformatic Analysis of ACVRL1 and RNF213 Variants Identified in the Patient Genetic testing of the patient's 21-year-old son revealed inheritance of both the ACVRL1 and RNF213 variants. While the son experienced occasional episodes of epistaxis, brain MRI did not show any features indicative of moyamoya disease. Differential Diagnosis This case necessitates differentiation from the following conditions: Von Willebrand Disease (vWD): While vWD is characterized by mucosal bleeding, it lacks the hallmark telangiectasia observed in this patient. Moreover, vWD is typically associated with abnormal coagulation parameters, which were not present in this case. Systemic Vasculitis: Although systemic vasculitis can involve cerebral vessels, it does not exhibit the characteristic imaging features of moyamoya disease. Additionally, systemic vasculitis is often accompanied by signs of systemic inflammation, which were absent in this patient. The coexistence of a pathogenic ACVRL1 mutation and an RNF213 variant, along with the clinical features, confirms the diagnosis of HHT combined with moyamoya disease. Treatment and Follow-Up The patient underwent local hemostatic treatment for HHT-related bleeding and anemia correction therapy. Regular follow-up was arranged to monitor the progression of cerebrovascular abnormalities and assess the potential risks associated with moyamoya disease....","Background Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by localized telangiectasia and arteriovenous malformations, caused by mutations in genes such as ACVRL1 and ENG. The global prevalence of HHT is estimated to be approximately 1 in 5,000 individuals.1 Previous research has shown that its molecular mechanisms are closely linked to the BMP9/10 signaling pathway.2 In contrast, moyamoya disease (MMD) is a cerebrovascular disorder characterized by the progressive narrowing of intracranial arteries and the formation of abnormal collateral vessels. MMD has a higher prevalence in East Asian populations, but the prevalence in China is lower than in other East Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea, with a rate of 1.01 per 100,000 people.3 RNF213, the major susceptibility gene for MMD, encodes an E3 ubiquitin ligase critical for angiogenesis and vascular remodeling.4 Although these diseases have distinct clinical manifestations, both involve abnormalities in vascular development and remodeling. Their coexistence in a single patient is exceptionally rare. This study presents the first reported case of HHT coexisting with MMD, providing insights into the potential synergistic interaction between ACVRL1 and RNF213 genetic variants and their role in complex hereditary vascular diseases. Case Presentation The patient, a 45-year-old female, presented with a six-year history of recurrent bilateral epistaxis that had worsened over the past year. Six years ago, she began experiencing spontaneous bilateral nosebleeds without any apparent triggers. These episodes were recurrent but resolved spontaneously. Over the past year, the frequency of epistaxis increased to 2–3 episodes per week, with poor response to repeated electrocautery treatments. Symptoms were aggravated by actions such as bending forward or exertion. Physical examination revealed scattered red, pinpoint telangiectasia on the face, oral mucosa, and fingertips. Nasal endoscopy showed classic “rose petal-like” vascular telangiectasia in the nasal mucosa bilaterally (Figure 1A–D). The patient denied neurological symptoms such as headache or dizziness and had no history of trauma or surgery. Family history was notable for her son having occasional nosebleeds, while her parents were healthy. She reported no history of hypertension, diabetes, or other chronic illnesses. Figure 1 Clinical, Radiological, and Genetic Findings in a Patient with Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and Moyamoya Disease. (A) Telangiectasia on the tongue mucosa. (B) Telangiectasia on the skin of the fingertips. (C and D) Nasal endoscopy showing characteristic telangiectasia (“rose petal-like” appearance) on the nasal mucosa. (E) Brain magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) revealing reduced distal branches of the bilateral anterior and middle cerebral arteries, with abnormal small collateral vessels, consistent with moyamoya disease. (F and G). Telangiectasia observed on the gastric mucosa during endoscopy. (H) Pedigree of the proband's family. The arrow indicates the proband (the patient), black symbols represent HHT-positive individuals, and slashed symbols indicate deceased family members. (I) Sanger sequencing results of the proband and her son. Red arrows indicate the identified genetic variants: ACVRL1 c.1231C>T in the proband and RNF213 c.13685C>T in both the proband and her son. Auxiliary Examinations Laboratory tests revealed a hemoglobin level of 83 g/L and an elevated reticulocyte count (85.9 × 10^9/L), indicating moderate anemia with compensatory bone marrow hyperplasia. Coagulation parameters and biochemical markers were within normal limits. Gastrointestinal endoscopy identified multiple sites of Telangiectasia (Figure 1F and G). Brain MRI and MRA (Figure 1E) showed a marked reduction in distal branches of the bilateral anterior and middle cerebral arteries, along with scattered small vascular networks, consistent with the typical imaging features of MMD. Whole-exome sequencing identified a heterozygous pathogenic mutation in the ACVRL1 gene (c.1231C>T, p.Arg411Trp) and a heterozygous variant of uncertain significance in the RNF213 gene (c.13685C>T, p.Pro4562Leu) (Figure 1I). Bioinformatic analysis suggested a high likelihood of pathogenicity for the RNF213 variant, with a CADD_phred score of 18.2 and a REVEL score of 0.146 (Table 1). Based on clinical manifestations, imaging findings, and genetic testing, the patient was diagnosed with HHT 2 coexisting with moyamoya disease. Table 1 Bioinformatic Analysis of ACVRL1 and RNF213 Variants Identified in the Patient Genetic testing of the patient's 21-year-old son revealed inheritance of both the ACVRL1 and RNF213 variants. While the son experienced occasional episodes of epistaxis, brain MRI did not show any features indicative of moyamoya disease. Differential Diagnosis This case necessitates differentiation from the following conditions: Von Willebrand Disease (vWD): While vWD is characterized by mucosal bleeding, it lacks the hallmark telangiectasia observed in this patient. Moreover, vWD is typically associated with abnormal coagulation parameters, which were not present in this case. Systemic Vasculitis: Although systemic vasculitis can involve cerebral vessels, it does not exhibit the characteristic imaging features of moyamoya disease. Additionally, systemic vasculitis is often accompanied by signs of systemic inflammation, which were absent in this patient. The coexistence of a pathogenic ACVRL1 mutation and an RNF213 variant, along with the clinical features, confirms the diagnosis of HHT combined with moyamoya disease. Treatment and Follow-Up The patient underwent local hemostatic treatment for HHT-related bleeding and anemia correction therapy. Regular follow-up was arranged to monitor the progression of cerebrovascular abnormalities and assess the potential risks associated with moyamoya disease....",2025-07-09 12:56:30,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The provided text is a detailed medical case study about Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia and Moyamoya Disease.

mov_C334E2522BD2587259D9AB95D5DC2EA3,"  If you've ever found yourself lost and found your way back, you may have used a form of wayfinding. Wayfinding is a process of utilizing cues from the natural world to orient yourself, to know yourself and where you are, and to find, in conversation with yourself and the natural world, a path towards a destination. Wayfinding: Human Intervention, curated by Jordan Barrant as part of the Roots & Culture CONNECT Residency, looks at three artists employing methodologies of wayfinding through a response to colonial interventions and the creation of their own. The exhibition features Renee Royale (b. 1990), a research-based and process-oriented visual artist based in New Orleans and Chicago; Aidan Anne Frierson (b. 1998), a Chicago-based papermaker; and Maya Davis (b. 1999), a Detroit-based multidisciplinary artist. Rooted at the intersection of Black Geographies and Feminist Ecologies, this exhibition looks to theorists Katherine McKittrick and Anna Tsing to understand how artists respond to the historical and ongoing interventions by colonial enterprises into our natural world, and how they, in response and in conversation with it, create their own material-based interventions. The exhibition also considers concepts of humanness as articulated by Sylvia Wynter and the dehumanizing of Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities. It suggests that, potentially, for those communities, those that commune with the land are finding ways towards newer versions of humans, ones that operate in cohesion with other lifeforms. Each artist in this exhibition presents their own form of wayfinding, both in their work and life, searching for paths through their conversations with their surrounding landscape, submergences into the environments, and interventions through their varied practices, and thus, assertions of humanness. Accompanying the exhibition, a short publication with the same name will be published, featuring essays from the curator Jordan Barrant, writer Talia Wright, and art conservator Tempe Stewart. The zine will comprise essays dissecting the concept of wayfinding and the human interventions the artists embark on. The zine will be made available August 15 and will be published digitally on August 10 during the Submerging at the Site event. The exhibition will feature three events, a virtual Co – Facilitated Q & A with the artists, curator and zine writers on August 10th, a Curatorial Walk through on August 17th and a Papermaking Workshop on August 24th. Aidan Anne Frierson (b. 1998, Chicago, IL) is an Artist and Educator from Chicago primarily practicing Handmade Papermaking. Her practice prioritizes Cotton, emphatically positing the material as “the reason Why We Are Here”. Through Handmade Papermaking, she activates material by engaging with color, texture, size, pattern and form. She honors history as a material by embedding ephemera in relationship with cellulose. Frierson's work is a culmination––a form––of material storytelling and diaristic cartography, that reflect memory's interdependent relationship with reality. Frierson is the Executive Director of the North American Hand Papermakers, and her public programming, education work, and cultural practice has shown up collaboratively in spaces such as: Hyde Park Art Center, Chicago Public Schools, Dieu Donné Papermill, Hook Pottery & Paper, Smart Museum of Art, and Penland School of Craft. RENEE ROYALE (b. 1990, Brooklyn, NY) is a research-based and process-oriented visual artist whose practice operates at the intersections of media, philosophy, and ecology. Her work bears witness to how film-based artworks and artifacts contribute to and are permanently altered by engagement with ecological degradation and colonial histories. By foregrounding media materiality and its entanglement with ecological systems, she addresses broader questions about temporality, belonging, and the legacies of Black ecologies. Her art has been featured in publications including liquid blackness, SEEING BLACK: Photography in New Orleans 1840 and Beyond, A Nation Takes Place: Navigating Race and Water in Contemporary Art, and an artist's book, Landscapes of Matter. She has exhibited work at various institutions including the Minnesota Marine Art Museum, Winona, MN; Contemporary Arts Center, New Orleans, LA; Louisiana State University, Baton Rouge, LA; Macalester College, St Paul, MN; Echo Contemporary, Atlanta, GA; Tulane University, New Orleans, LA; Antenna Gallery, New Orleans, LA; and ICOSA Gallery, Austin, TX. Maya Davis's (b. 1999, Lansing, Michigan) artistic practice explores the interconnected concepts of care, preservation, and resilience through diverse media and processes. They examine care as both an intimate act and a collective responsibility, drawing parallels between human experiences and natural systems. Central to their work is an investigation of transformation and endurance, particularly through materials that embody cyclical patterns of damage and repair. Through research-based approaches, Davis cultivates and transforms organic materials, creating works that embody histories of adaptation and survival. Their practice examines complex relationships between colonization, displacement, and belonging that shape both communities and ecosystems. By interweaving biological, historical, and personal narratives, Davis invites reflection on our collective responsibility to nurture shared environments and the human capacity for adaptation within a world marked by both trauma and healing. Davis has participated in residencies and fellowships with organizations such as Independent Curators International, Modern Ancient Brown, and Bulk Space. Their work has been featured in galleries including Good Weather (Chicago), White Columns (New York), and the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit. Davis has received support from organizations such as Culture Source (ARC Fellow), Red Bull Arts (Detroit Mini-grant Recipient), MdW Coalition (Artist Organizer Fellow), and Petty Propolis (Visionary Resistance Fellow). Jordan Barrant (b. 2000, Boston, MA) is a Chicago-based writer, curator, and interdisciplinary artist whose work explores the cosmological intersections of the ineffable, the American South and the Caribbean, with a focus on land-based and intuitive practices. Through oral histories and archival research, Jordan views the past as an invitation to imagine brighter, more loving futures. She received her bachelors from Spelman College in the Women's Studies and Art History Department and her Masters from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in the Visual and Critical Studies department. She was the co-curator of The Black Domestic at SITE Galleries. She has participated in an Artpace San Antonio Curatorial Residency, a Chicago Artist Coalition Curatorial Residency and the New Local Space Kingston Residency and has received fellowships from the Pulitzer Center and the Fulbright Program. Her writing has been published in Burnaway, the Chicago Reader, the Boston Art Review, Sixty Inches from Center and the Black Embodiments Studio: A Year in Black Art.

But since that's still weeks away and curiosity is getting the better of me, does anyone has informed takes on a.) connections between HRT and thyroid issues, and b.) whether it's okay to take progesterone only when needed rather than religiously every month. My story, briefly: After months of terrible sleep, fatigue, and night sweats, I was prescribed 100 mg of progesterone, taken cyclically. It worked well without significant side effects, but a few months in, I developed a toxic thyroid nodule that was causing hyperthyroidism. I stopped taking the progesterone - perhaps unwise, but I wanted to know which symptoms were caused by my thyroid vs. perimenopause, since there's so much overlap - but still felt good for several months, even as I awaited thyroid treatment. My sleep quality was high, I wasn't sweating at night, my energy levels were even. Then this last menstrual cycle, the old symptoms came raging back: sweats, nighttime anxiety, insomnia. This leads to my questions. Mostly out of curiosity, is it possible that the progesterone triggered the thyroid issue? I know there's interplay between the two but don't have the medical background to fully understand it. And more importantly, as our hormones fluctuate wildly during perimenopause, is there any harm skipping oral progesterone when we're feeling good and then restart if/when our perimenopausal symptoms start raging again?","This is a highly specific series of questions, and I fully intend to pose them to my doctor at my next appointment.

Learn more Keeping teeth healthy is so important and dentists will point out if they think a patient hasn't been brushing properly. There's an Oral-B electric toothbrush with £100 knocked off the price in the Amazon Prime Day sale that shoppers are calling the 'best one I've ever purchased' and say 'even my dentist commented' on the difference. The Oral-B iO3 Electric Toothbrush has been reduced from £160 to £159.99 for a limited time. It promises healthier gums in just one week by removing 100 per cent more plaque vs a manual toothbrush. The iO pressure sensor flags whether the user is applying the right pressure for an effective and safe clean, while the iO light ring timer lets the user know when the dentist-recommended two-minute brush time has passed. The toothbrush features three cleaning modes - daily clean, sensitive and whitening, while the round brush heads help to reach where rectangular manual brushes don't. Meanwhile, the long-lasting lithium-ion battery means the brush can run for longer between charges. Oral-B is also offering shoppers a 30-day money-back guarantee. The Oral-B iO3 Electric Toothbrush has more than 15,000 reviews on the Amazon website, giving it an average customer rating of 4.5 out of five stars. One shopper said: ""I'm not the toothbrush expert but just really wanted to say that this toothbrush is the best one I've ever purchased, highly recommend it.

Sources confirmed that the CBI headquarters has entrusted the case to its Special Crime Unit, which is also handling the infamous 2020 Sathankulam custodial deaths of P Jayaraj and J Bennix. The move comes after the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court directed the CBI to take over the probe and submit its final report by August 20. The court also instructed the Tamil Nadu Police to fully cooperate with the central agency during the course of the investigation. CBI officials from Delhi are expected to formally assume charge of the case soon by registering a fresh FIR, once they receive the report of the judicial inquiry conducted by the district judge. ""The registration of the case is currently in process,"" an official source said. Ajith Kumar, a native of Tamil Nadu, died on June 29, allegedly after being subjected to brutal custodial torture by a special team of police personnel. The assault reportedly took place during an interrogation based on an oral complaint related to the theft of jewels from a parked car near the Badrakali Amman Temple in Madapuram. Following public outrage and legal intervention, the case was transferred to the CBI, and six police officers were arrested in connection with the incident. The state government, in response to the High Court's direction, issued a Government Order (GO) to facilitate the transfer of the investigation to the central agency. Earlier, the Madras High Court had directed the district judge to conduct a detailed inquiry into the incident. The court's latest order reiterated the urgency of the matter and stressed that the CBI must submit its findings before the deadline. The bench also reminded the state police to offer all necessary assistance to ensure a transparent and thorough investigation.

mov_6D882A1D2D6A7B8BB3E6BF2F093EA373,"  Advancing corrector and potentiator programs to address underlying biology of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) across multiple mutations Team includes preeminent scientific leaders in ADPKD; rapid discovery and development efforts powered by suite of proprietary assays $54.5 million in seed financing led by founding investor 5AM Ventures alongside Atlas Venture, OrbiMed and Qiming Venture Partners USA BERKELEY, Calif., July 10, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Renasant Bio (Renasant), announced its launch today to advance next-generation disease-modifying treatments for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the leading genetic cause of end-stage renal failure. Renasant is developing a pipeline of oral small molecule corrector and first-in-class potentiator therapies that directly target the underlying biology of ADPKD, with the goal of restoring the function of key polycystin proteins across multiple different mutations to halt disease progression. Renasant has raised $54.5 million in seed funding, co-led by founding investor 5AM Ventures, alongside other leading life sciences investors including Atlas Venture, OrbiMed and Qiming Ventures. The seed financing will support further progression of Renasant's lead corrector program and ongoing discovery efforts for the company's first-in-class potentiator program. ""ADPKD is a devastating genetic disorder that affects more than 12 million people globally and still lacks truly disease-modifying therapies,"" said Emily Conley, Ph.D., chief executive officer of Renasant. ""Our platform of differentiated correctors and first-in-class potentiator therapies are designed to directly address the underlying cause of ADPKD across its broad mutation spectrum, offering the potential to benefit the vast majority of patients."" Next-Generation Corrector and Potentiator Programs for ADPKD Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease is a chronic, progressive genetic condition marked by the progressive formation of fluid-filled cysts in the kidneys, often leading to end-stage renal failure. The condition arises from mutations in the PKD1 and PKD2 genes, which encode polycystin proteins PC1 and PC2—critical regulators of kidney cell function. The genetic mutations underlying ADPKD are extremely heterogeneous, with no single mutation found in more than 2% of patients. Disease-modifying strategies that correct or potentiate polycystin biology must overcome this diversity—making therapies that work broadly across mutations a key treatment advancement for ADPKD. Current therapies do not directly address the underlying protein dysfunction and are limited in their applicability and tolerability. Addressing the Underlying Biological Drivers of ADPKD Renasant's therapeutic strategy is centered on restoring the normal function of PC1 and PC2. Through its leading expertise in ADPKD biology, including electrophysiology and polycystin channel physiology, Renasant has developed proprietary assays to assess protein trafficking and other key mechanisms, enabling precision-guided development of novel therapies for ADPKD. The company's lead program is a small molecule corrector designed to work across a wide range of disease-causing mutations to stabilize and properly fold PC1/2, promoting protein trafficking to restore kidney function. The program is currently progressing through preclinical development. In addition, Renasant is advancing discovery efforts toward a potentiator to enhance ion flux through the polycystin channel and support anti-cystogenic signaling—a first-in-class approach in ADPKD. Correctors and potentiators can act as stand-alone therapies, or they can be combined for synergistic effect. ""Our corrector program is designed to work across a broad range of mutations, and our potentiator represents a novel mechanism of action in ADPKD,"" said Gus Gustafson, Ph.D., chief scientific officer. ""These programs hold the potential to reshape the treatment landscape. We are very encouraged by our preclinical data and committed to rapidly advancing these programs for patients in urgent need."" Team of Leading Experts in ADPKD Renasant is led by a world-class team with deep expertise in ADPKD biology and a proven track record in building biopharma companies. The team includes researchers who have shaped the field of polycystin biology and electrophysiology, seasoned drug developers, and biotech executives experienced in advancing cutting-edge scientific approaches. ""5AM Ventures founded Renasant around a bold idea: that we could change the trajectory of ADPKD,"" said Deborah Palestrant, Ph.D., partner at 5AM Ventures. ""ADPKD is one of the most complex diseases in renal medicine, but Renasant has assembled the right team, with years of research experience in polycystic disease that has informed the right scientific approach. We're proud to have supported the company from the start and are energized by its progress and commitment to delivering truly disease-modifying treatments for ADPKD patients.""

(TSXV:KDOZ)(OTCQB:KDOZF), a global leader in safe digital media and advertising technology and developer of the market-leading Kidoz Contextual Ad Network that connects brands with audiences through content analysis rather than user data, is proud to announce the launch of Kite IQ - the company 's proprietary AI platform, designed to deliver category leading contextual targeting at scale. Kidoz helps brands build meaningful connections with audiences in safe, high-performance environments, without compromising privacy or safety. Kite IQ uses advanced machine learning and semantic analysis to classify mobile apps across theme, content, and audience appeal. By enriching every app with real-time contextual metadata detecting genre, themes, age-group appeal, and gender targeting through a combination of natural language processing and similarity modeling, Kite IQ enables brands to match their message with the right audience in the right environment increasing the value of campaigns, while maintaining full compliance with global privacy regulations. Kite IQ doesn 't just categorize apps; it interprets them. ""For too long, advertisers have been forced to rely on generic store tags that say little about the real content or audience of an app, "" said Jason WilliamsCEO at Kidoz, ""Kite IQ advances our unique personal data-free capabilities by combining machine learning classifiers and semantic intelligence. We give brands a new level of control, context, and confidence in every impression thereby delivering higher value campaigns. Kite IQ will also provide details of the campaign to customers to prove value. "" ""Kite IQ delivers high-accuracy classification, empowering brands to align their campaigns with the right content and audience resulting in higher engagement and improved click-through rates driven by stronger contextual relevance. All of this is achieved while maintaining full compliance with global privacy standards like COPPA and GDPR. "" he added.

From AI-powered contextual intelligence to flexible monetization infrastructure, these foundational developments mark a critical transition from product development to scalable commercial deployment. While this strategic focus on investment positions Kidoz to capture greater long-term value across the mobile media ecosystem, the broader market uncertainty recently experienced due to threatened tariffs may impact our second quarter results, expected to be released near the end of August.

480b19fea9837b1cf98c6b02aa152bab,"  Story VCH expert breaks down the basics of hair loss Dr. Youwen Zhou works at the Vancouver Coastal Health Skin Care Centre, which includes services that treat hair loss. He provides answers to an issue affecting an estimated one in five Canadians. Q. What are the main causes of hair loss? A. For men, causes can include: - The most common is androgenetic alopecia (male pattern baldness), driven by a genetic predisposition and sensitivity to dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a hormone that stimulates the development of male characteristics. - Shifts in hormone levels, particularly those affecting DHT. - Medications for depression, high blood pressure, acne, arthritis, gout or fungal issues. - Other factors, like stress, nutritional deficiencies, or underlying health issues such as autoimmune disease or thyroid problems. For women, causes can include: - Genetics and hormonal fluctuations, for example, during pregnancy or menopause. - Disorders like thyroid imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome, or autoimmune diseases. - Other factors like high stress levels, nutritional deficits, and hairstyling practices, such as tight hairstyles or chemical treatments. Q. What are the main treatments for hair loss? A. For men, treatments include: - Medications such as topical and oral Minoxidil helps stimulate hair growth and oral Finasteride works by reducing DHT levels. - Surgical and other advanced options can be hair transplant procedures and low-level laser therapy or platelet-rich plasma treatments, but the results are mixed. For women, treatments include: - Medications such as topical and oral Minoxidil is often recommended. - Anti-androgen treatments, such as spironolactone, can balance hormone levels. - In some cases, hormonal therapies, such as oral contraceptives, may help regulate imbalances. - Additional options can be low-level laser therapy and platelet-rich plasma treatments, which have mixed success. - Hair transplant may be considered in select cases or hair prosthesis (hair piece or wigs). - Complementary strategies would be nutritional support, such as iron supplements, and stress management. Q. Do you recommend any lifestyle changes to help reduce hair loss? A. Yes, there are several lifestyle recommendations, including: - A balanced diet, which can ensure adequate intake of protein, vitamins (especially B vitamins and vitamin D), iron, and other essential nutrients. - Stress management techniques such as regular exercise, mindfulness, or meditation to reduce stress-induced hair loss. - Avoid excessive heat styling, chemical treatments, and hairstyles that pull on the hair (tight ponytails, braids, etc.) Use mild, nourishing hair products. - Maintain a healthy lifestyle, including sufficient sleep and hydration. Regular health check-ups can help identify and manage any underlying conditions that might contribute to hair loss.","Story VCH expert breaks down the basics of hair loss Dr. Youwen Zhou works at the Vancouver Coastal Health Skin Care Centre, which includes services that treat hair loss.

mov_B4889BCE0FB424AF12AAAA0FA42B8DA4,"  The use of ambiguity is a staple feature in many forms of art. In Romeo and Juliet, Mercutio, after being stabbed, says ""ask for me tomorrow, and you shall find me a grave man."" Shakespeare deployed ambiguity to great effect, in order to create ""a constant but fluctuating separation between the reader and text, the literal and figurative, and the expressed and implied."" Poetry - from Milton's ""fruit of the forbidden tree"" to Elizabeth Bishop's ""the ties ... too close together"" has always utilised ambiguity to proliferate meaning. More recently, abstract expressionist art thrived on ambiguity, taking it to be ""its own reward."" The Supreme Court's 10th June ""order"" on the Bihar election rolls, authored by Dhulia and Bagchi JJ., is either a fragment of Shakespearean drama or a poem in the tradition of Bishop - or perhaps a piece of abstract art. It must be one of these three things, because we know what it is certainly not: a judicial order delivered by a constitutional court. The context of yesterday's hearing has been discussed in some detail in Vasudev's blog post yesterday, which was published before the written order was uploaded to the Supreme Court's website. The case was brought to Court because the Election Commission's decision to conduct a ""special intensive revision"" of Bihar's electoral rolls in the run-up to the state election, which required all voters who had been enrolled after 2003 to ""re-enroll"" and demonstrate their eligibility to vote within a period of one month, risked causing widespread disenfranchisement in the state (for detailed analyses, see here, here, here, and here). Apart from issues around jurisdiction and disenfranchisement, there was also the Supreme Court's own prior precedent of Lal Babu Hussein, which made it clear that a generalised removal of individuals from the electoral rolls, and requiring them to prove their eligibility in order to be put back on those rolls, was unconstitutional. There were two clear and defining features of the case before the Court: its seriousness (mass disenfranchisement goes to the very heart of the democratic process, and of democratic legitimacy) and its urgency (the draft electoral rolls are to be published on August 1). Given its legal assessment of the matter, there were also a range of constitutional remedies open to the Court, which would protect voting and citizenship rights: from an interim stay of the process (given the proximity of the state elections) to more modulated orders (for example, stipulating that those individuals who had been on the Special Summary Roll that had been finalised as recently as January 2025 could not be mass-removed from it). At the very least, one would expect that a constitutional court, when faced with such a case, would accord it the seriousness that it deserves, and write a reasoned order explaining and justifying the position that it took. Indeed, on 10 July, the Court had all the tools to do so: the case was argued over the course of four hours (enough time for a final hearing, before most courts), with both sides presenting their arguments in some detail. Informal live records of the oral hearing also show that the bench put detailed questions to both sets of counsel. Unfortunately, however, the order that followed - first, orally dictated in court, and subsequently published a few hours later - reflected none of this. Rather, it followed familiar pattern that we have come to expect from the Supreme Court in high-stakes constitutional cases: a pattern of ambiguity, evasion, and deferral (see here). After a brief recitation of both sides' cases, without any consideration of the legal arguments, the Court says:      ""... in our prima facie opinion, it would be in the interest of justice if the Election Commission of India also considers the following three documents as well (apart from the 11 documents mentioned in order dated 24.06.2025), i.e., A) Aadhar Card; B) Electors Photo Identify Card (EPIC), which is issued by Election Commission of India itself, and C) the Ration Card."" This sentence is the piece of abstract art that headlines this post: it is so deftly worded in order to avoid the burden of clarity and certainty, that it reminds me of that famous example of the ""triple pun"": ""A rancher who was ready to retire gave the operation of his ranch over to his two boys. He renamed it ""Focus,"" because it was where the sons raise meat."" * Well, here the Supreme Court seems to be communicating a triple meaning: is the Election Commission (a) bound to accept these three documents if presented to it, or (b) ""consider"" them on a case to case basis, or (c) ""consider"" whether to include one or two or all of these documents as proofs of citizenship in the SIR process? Is this even a judicial order, or is the Court engaging in a philosophical disquisition of what the interests of justice might require? Would it have killed the Court to write in legal language: ""We direct the Election Commission to..."" or ""We declare that these three documents...""? Ambiguity plays a vital role in art, where proliferating meanings and open endings can enrich the process of interpretation. But in a case of a judicial order, where the voting rights of masses of individuals turn upon words, ambiguity is the most profound exemplar of judicial abdication, of a court failing to do its job. And ambiguity is not neutral: it favours the party that holds power, the party that can shape ambiguity to its own ends - in this case, the Election Commission. In the 10 July order, this ambiguity is coupled with deferral: the Court fixes the next date of hearing eighteen days later, on 28 July, and four days before the publication of the draft roll: by which time the process will be more or less complete, and will allow for a fait accompli to be presented to the Court as a constitutional argument for non-interference - a story that we have seen play out many times in the past. And finally, evasion completes the trinity of ambiguity, deferral and evasion: the Court gives no reason for its observations on these three documents (leading, once again, to civil rights becoming the gift of judicial patronage and negotiations rather than enforceable rights, as I've previously written), and does not engage with any of the other issues raised in the petitions (what, one might then ask, was this four-hour hearing for?) . In short, the Court does not do its primary job, which is to pass a reasoned, judicial order on an important and urgent constitutional case brought before it. One may ask: if the Court is unwilling or unable to pass a reasoned order in this case - which goes to the heart of the democratic process - when will it ever do so? Perhaps, in the absence of that, all that we are left to do is to admire what the Court does give us, on its own terms: no judicial order, but a piece of abstract art. * The triple pun is the sons raise meat/the sun's rays meet.","The use of ambiguity is a staple feature in many forms of art.

After a brief recitation of both sides' cases, without any consideration of the legal arguments, the Court says: ""... in our prima facie opinion, it would be in the interest of justice if the Election Commission of India also considers the following three documents as well (apart from the 11 documents mentioned in order dated 24.06.2025), i.e., A) Aadhar Card; B) Electors Photo Identify Card (EPIC), which is issued by Election Commission of India itself, and C) the Ration Card."" This sentence is the piece of abstract art that headlines this post: it is so deftly worded in order to avoid the burden of clarity and certainty, that it reminds me of that famous example of the ""triple pun"": ""A rancher who was ready to retire gave the operation of his ranch over to his two boys. He renamed it ""Focus,"" because it was where the sons raise meat."" * Well, here the Supreme Court seems to be communicating a triple meaning: is the Election Commission (a) bound to accept these three documents if presented to it, or (b) ""consider"" them on a case to case basis, or (c) ""consider"" whether to include one or two or all of these documents as proofs of citizenship in the SIR process? Is this even a judicial order, or is the Court engaging in a philosophical disquisition of what the interests of justice might require? Would it have killed the Court to write in legal language: ""We direct the Election Commission to..."" or ""We declare that these three documents...""? Ambiguity plays a vital role in art, where proliferating meanings and open endings can enrich the process of interpretation. But in a case of a judicial order, where the voting rights of masses of individuals turn upon words, ambiguity is the most profound exemplar of judicial abdication, of a court failing to do its job. And ambiguity is not neutral: it favours the party that holds power, the party that can shape ambiguity to its own ends - in this case, the Election Commission. In the 10 July order, this ambiguity is coupled with deferral: the Court fixes the next date of hearing eighteen days later, on 28 July, and four days before the publication of the draft roll: by which time the process will be more or less complete, and will allow for a fait accompli to be presented to the Court as a constitutional argument for non-interference - a story that we have seen play out many times in the past. And finally, evasion completes the trinity of ambiguity, deferral and evasion: the Court gives no reason for its observations on these three documents (leading, once again, to civil rights becoming the gift of judicial patronage and negotiations rather than enforceable rights, as I've previously written), and does not engage with any of the other issues raised in the petitions (what, one might then ask, was this four-hour hearing for?) . In short, the Court does not do its primary job, which is to pass a reasoned, judicial order on an important and urgent constitutional case brought before it. One may ask: if the Court is unwilling or unable to pass a reasoned order in this case - which goes to the heart of the democratic process - when will it ever do so? Perhaps, in the absence of that, all that we are left to do is to admire what the Court does give us, on its own terms: no judicial order, but a piece of abstract art. * The triple pun is the sons raise meat/the sun's rays meet.",2025-07-11 06:02:37,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The provided text is a lengthy legal analysis about an Election Commission order and contains no mention of Oral-B, oral care products, or anything related to the brand's products or category.

n2ibhhj,"  An airplane just gets you from point A to point B. You can do that by walking/swimming/climbing with enough breaks etc. It would just take an unfeasibly long time, and probably involve piggybacking on a less advanced technology (flotation devices, special clothing and gear, etc.) For the moon question, it's also basically a question of distances. We could build a human pyramid to the moon and then jump in the direction of Mars. We would eventually be there if we jumped just right. Of course there's the whole radiation and oxygen problem, so we would (and do) have to use other scaffolding technologies (air supply extending the lungs, special textiles extending the skin, essentially extending the time you can hold your breath, the time your skin can be exposed to radiation, etc.) For the data encoding, there is nothing stopping us from memorizing chunks of binary, spreading that over a large group of people each responsible for a certain chunk and passing it down generation to generation (like story tellers in oral cultures). It's unfeasible but not impossible. The « unfeasibility » part is important to how tech (defined as any means of externalizing our internal conception of a potential world) changes our individual and collective consciousness. With each tech, things that we wouldn't even consider trying to do become suddenly feasible, therefore spawning new tech developments to bring that into reality, in a positive feedback loop. A vague dream becomes a long shot becomes a reality which spawns new dreams with an updated set of parameters of what is feasible. This of course is dangerous but apparently unstoppable. Since technologies have their origins essentially in « daydreaming » about potential realities, the arts are WAY ahead of engineers in defining and exploring avenues of development, since that is essentially what art does: project virtualities into symbolic form for sharing.

Thousands of deals are still live across laptops, electric toothbrushes, fans and more. What are the best Amazon Prime Day deals today? At a glance: You need to be a Prime member to access the deals, but Amazon is currently offering a 30-day free trial. After that, it costs £8.99 a month and you can cancel any time before the trial ends. The Telegraph Recommended team, usually responsible for testing and reviewing products, is well-qualified to help you find the best genuine deals in the Amazon Prime Day sale. We've seen many sales events and know how to tell a good deal from a poor one. Read our tips on how to find the best deals to see how we do it. Every deal featured below has been checked using our filter system. This involves multiple team members, spreadsheets, and a healthy dose of scepticism. We don't just compare discounts to the RRP (recommended retail price). Instead, we track the average price of each product over six months and calculate the percentage decrease from that. Most products are rarely sold at their RRP, so we focus on genuine price reductions. We also only recommend items we've tested ourselves to ensure you're buying a product that works. Throughout the remaining hours of the sale, our experts across tech, home, garden, health, fitness, beauty, grooming and travel will post their top deals below, whether that's from the Amazon Prime Day sale or an even better offer from the high street that we think you should know about. Look out for deals on Shark, Ninja, Shokz, Eufy, Oral B and Amazon's own-brands like Kindle and Echo. We'll be here until 10pm to make sure you find real savings, and avoid anything that's not worth your money. There aren't tonnes of products for sale from those we've reviewed in our guides to the best electric shavers, the best beard trimmers and the best hair clippers, but there are a couple.

For example, the Asus Zenbook A14 is £100 cheaper on Currys, despite it also being included in the Prime Day sales. Our reviewer, Alun Taylor, reckons it even gives an Apple MacBook a run for its money. “Compared to the MacBook, the A14 is better value once you've factored in a matching SSD, has a more colourful and larger albeit lower-resolution display, a better keyboard and more ports. It's also lighter and has better battery life.” Of course, the MacBook is still more powerful. You can find a good deal on the MacBook Air 2025 higher up this blog.

Before we log off for the day, here are some tips to help you shop savvily as the sale ends: Make sure you can't get it cheaper elsewhere: Use price comparison tools like Price Spy and Price Runner, look at your favourite high street retailers and consider second-hand options from trusted resellers like Back Market or Amazon Resale. Check to see if prices are genuinely at their lowest: Tools like CamelCamelCamel or Keepa show you how prices fluctuate throughout the year. This will help you assess whether you may be able to get it cheaper at another time and if it's as good a saving as advertised.Buy only things you already want: Try not to make a hasty impulse buy on something you haven't researched. If you've wanted it for a while, then you're less likely to regret your purchase.Think ahead: As we've said earlier, with the sun out you're unlikely to find discounts on garden furniture and most of the great deals on air conditioning have now disappeared. But if you know you need something in the autumn, like a dehumidifier, now may be a great time to buy. Demand for cold weather products is lower in July and therefore discounts may be better. Read our full advice on how to find the best deals 09:24 PM BST Why we're not recommending many smartphone deals Well, because there aren't many.

1ly1f9p,"  Hello Everyone About 10 years back started noticing extreme harifall. Went to a doctor, he prescribed finasteride 1mg + minoxidil 2.5%, which was later increased to 5% then 7.5% and then eventually 10%. Used them for about 2-2.5 years with no results at all. Luckily there were no side effects either. Minoxidil did help grow those tiny babyish hairs but they never grew more than that. The shedding was extreme when it was started and when I stopped the medications and I don't think that the shedded hair were recovered, this makes me very scared of the shedding phase. Then after studies got stuck in a 9-6 job. I used to exercise whenever I got time and my diet was mostly clean. In the end of 2019, went for a transplant and got about 2000 hairs transplanted because I only wanted to cover the receeded areas in the front. Went to a small clinic rather than those big one's due to budget issues. They didn't prescribe finasteride or minoxidil to maintain and I was okay because I didn't get any results with them in the first place. Then covid hit hard. During the lockdown it was found that I have a congenital heart issue and my valve had to be replaced. I am on blood thinners and a medicine which keeps the heart rate low for life. And lo and behold this valve replacement has given me an ed for life. Went to an extreme depression phase due to this and due to some other personal stuff and my therapist prescribed some anti depressants few years back, though I have stopped taking them now. Fast forward to today, loosing native hair. My heart doctor says that I can take finasteride and use minoxidil, but told me to start from the lowest finasteride from the lowest dose and to monitor it regularly. But I just don't want to take the oral one. Few queries a.  Does it make sense to apply topical minoxidil which has finasteride in it? Has this combo given results to anyone and does it get absorbed in the blood? b. Is topical min + fin solution having any shedding phase when it is started or stopped? c. I used to use minoxidil which used to come in an oil/serum form but nowadays people are using the same in a foam form. Which one is better out of the two? And should it be applied only on the affected area or the whole head? d. Do PRP sessions really help? Is there any scientific research behind it? I have stopped taking them because a. the price have increased by like 5x and b. earlier the clinic used to run the blood sample in that machine for 15-20 mins and nowadays they run it for less than 5 mins. When I asked about it, they said that they have a new machine which processes it in less time, which I think is a crappy reason. e. Using baby shampoo like every alternate day as told by the clinic. Do I need to change this too after starting minoxidil? How does nizoral/keta shampoo help one here and how often should it be used? f. I have seen many people using a solution which has minoxidil + finasteride + dutasteride (or either one of them) + tretonin. Is fin + duta + tret combo needed? How does tret help one in a situation like this?","Hello Everyone About 10 years back started noticing extreme harifall.

The shedding was extreme when it was started and when I stopped the medications and I don't think that the shedded hair were recovered, this makes me very scared of the shedding phase. Then after studies got stuck in a 9-6 job. I used to exercise whenever I got time and my diet was mostly clean. In the end of 2019, went for a transplant and got about 2000 hairs transplanted because I only wanted to cover the receeded areas in the front. Went to a small clinic rather than those big one's due to budget issues. They didn't prescribe finasteride or minoxidil to maintain and I was okay because I didn't get any results with them in the first place. Then covid hit hard. During the lockdown it was found that I have a congenital heart issue and my valve had to be replaced. I am on blood thinners and a medicine which keeps the heart rate low for life. And lo and behold this valve replacement has given me an ed for life. Went to an extreme depression phase due to this and due to some other personal stuff and my therapist prescribed some anti depressants few years back, though I have stopped taking them now. Fast forward to today, loosing native hair. My heart doctor says that I can take finasteride and use minoxidil, but told me to start from the lowest finasteride from the lowest dose and to monitor it regularly. But I just don't want to take the oral one. Few queries a.  Does it make sense to apply topical minoxidil which has finasteride in it? Has this combo given results to anyone and does it get absorbed in the blood? b. Is topical min + fin solution having any shedding phase when it is started or stopped? c. I used to use minoxidil which used to come in an oil/serum form but nowadays people are using the same in a foam form. Which one is better out of the two? And should it be applied only on the affected area or the whole head? d. Do PRP sessions really help? Is there any scientific research behind it? I have stopped taking them because a. the price have increased by like 5x and b. earlier the clinic used to run the blood sample in that machine for 15-20 mins and nowadays they run it for less than 5 mins. When I asked about it, they said that they have a new machine which processes it in less time, which I think is a crappy reason. e. Using baby shampoo like every alternate day as told by the clinic. Do I need to change this too after starting minoxidil? How does nizoral/keta shampoo help one here and how often should it be used? f. I have seen many people using a solution which has minoxidil + finasteride + dutasteride (or either one of them) + tretonin. Is fin + duta + tret combo needed?

1lyjm63,"  As most people know, the official Oral B replacement heads are far too overpriced. The problem I have is that every generic branded replacement toothbrush head I've tried were subpar. Their fit is a little off, so there's a lot of rattle, and you can feel the fact that the head isn't vibrating as much/strongly as it does with an official replacement head. Because of this I'm apprehensive on buying generics online from Amazon/Temu/Aliexpress. I would be stuck with a bunch heads at once if they turn out to be bad (in addition to wasting money). The top listings always have a bunch of great reviews, but I can't help but think that many people either don't notice this flaw that I have, or have lower standards.

If the vibration in your hand is the biggest problem but you like it otherwise, you could consider wrapping the lower handle in something that muffled the vibrations, like that bendy foam that comes in packages sometimes, or just a washcloth. In any case, as other folks have written, you don't *need* to use an electric toothbrush, unless you want to. If you or your partner are concerned, using mouthwash after brushing is an alternative way to up your oral hygiene game. But honestly, if you're flossing already and brushing (not too hard) then you're doing great! If your dentist has concerns, you could consider changing your habits, but if not I wouldn't worry to much. I stuck with it, personally, because I hate hate hate the feeling of anything on my teeth, and I feel much cleaner using my electric toothbrush. But that's a personal decision. I have an Oral B which I got specifically because it's a little quieter than others. It still makes noise though… Generally, I try to distract myself by getting into a Wikipedia rabbit hole while I brush, or an article that I've been looking forward to. Honestly, the thing I like the least is that there's more 'spray' (sorry, gross!!!!) from the brush vibration, but I try to counter that by brushing right before I shower, or at least before I get dressed. If I'm too overwhelmed to do that, I'll let myself brush my teeth in the shower (usually while listening to an audiobook for distraction.)","I get it!
