The in-store debut features the brand's best selling Mango Soursop Bitters, a tropical spin on its signature bitter detox tonic that has taken TikTok by storm. Known for its bold taste and plant powered formula, the bitters support digestion, reduce bloating, and promote internal balance without synthetic ingredients. ""This is more than a shelf placement, it's a moment,"" said founder Theo Edwards. ""We took ancient Caribbean herbs that my grandmother used and built something modern, effective, and rooted in wisdom. To now see our bitters on GNC shelves is proof that people are ready for real healing."" The Mango Soursop Bitters blend includes powerful ingredients like soursop leaf, sea moss, burdock root, ginger, and African mango. The flavor forward formula has quickly become a go to for gut health seekers and detox enthusiasts across TikTok, Amazon, and retail. With over 256 stores carrying the product and six figure monthly revenue across TikTok Shop, Amazon, and wholesale channels, Mira's Harvest is one of the only Caribbean founded wellness brands available in major U.S. retail. The launch signals a new era of culturally rooted herbal products entering the mainstream. Mira's Harvest Mango Soursop Bitters is now available in select GNC stores throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico, and online at GNC.com. The company also plans to launch a 15 day herbal cleanse and soursop capsule line later this year.

n1bmn5o,"  I completely agree with everyone's comments. When I got the new packaging, I thought it was just cosmetic. It turns out that it doesn't mix worth a dam, the sediment that is left is literally salt (I have chewed the leftover pieces and they are absolutely coarse salt), and the flavor is much worse. I can only tolerate chocolate flavored shakes, but I don't think the other flavors will be any different. I have had an Amazon subscription for isopure for a couple of years now, which I have since canceled. I'm returning my last container. My focus is carbohydrates. Isopure had a net zero carb for the chocolate flavor, which was fantastic. The closest match I have found is from GNC advanced muscle performance pure isolate chocolate lava cake. It has only two net carbs and only 15 more calories per serving, which is the best I can find so far. I did see isopure unflavored, which has zero carbs and lower calories. I haven't tried it yet. If I can't choke it down, I'm going to have to go with the pure isolate from GNC. I don't want to do that, because it's more calories, carbs, and is noticeably more expensive.
