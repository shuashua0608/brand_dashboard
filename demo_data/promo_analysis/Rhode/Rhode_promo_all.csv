tw_sl_b467e238e5adf01ff9b4050416abfd45,"  SPR_COMBO[ru]Как выпускница Стэнфорда зарабатывает $100 млн в год на косметике для подростков Обеденный стол Кимберли Хо почти всегда завален. В любой день недели можно увидеть, как 35-летняя основательница и генеральный директор нью-йоркской компании по производству косметики для детей Evereden, рискуя испачкать белую мраморную поверхность, тестирует яркие помады в форме мелка и прочие продукты, предназначенные для поколения Альфа — людей, родившихся после 2010 года. «Сейчас у нас есть лаборатория с технологами и специалистами по исследованиям и разработкам, — говорит Кимберли, участница рейтинга Forbes «30 до 30» 2019 года. — Но я никогда не хотела отказываться от этой части работы, одержимость продуктом у меня в крови». С момента, когда она основала Evereden в 2018 году вместе с мужем, сотрудником Goldman Sachs Хуангом Ли, бренд ежегодно приносит $100 млн прибыли. Компания заняла нишу безопасных для детей и подростков средств по уходу за кожей. Среди первых клиентов Evereden много молодых мам, которые искали безопасные средства для чувствительной кожи младенцев. В период с 2018-го по 2021 год компания Evereden привлекла около $40 млн венчурного финансирования и, как и ее клиентская база, стала выросла, расширив ассортимент сыворотками для лица, кондиционерами для волос и парфюмерией, разработанными специально для детей, подростков и беременных. Хотя продукция компании представлена в Sephora в восьми странах за пределами США, включая Канаду, Австралию и Филиппины, большая часть ее доходов приходится на прямые продажи потребителям через Интернет. «Миллиарды долларов инвестиций были вложены в бьюти-продукты, косметику и уход за кожей женщин, но ни одна из этих инноваций и инвестиций не была направлена на уход за кожей для всей семьи, — говорит Кимберли. — Мне это несоответствие казалось бессмысленным». Согласно исследованию Ulta Beauty, проведенному в 2024 году, из-за социальных сетей поколение Альфа впервые узнает об уходовой косметике в среднем в восемь лет (для сравнения: у миллениалов и зумеров это происходило в 15 и 12 лет соответственно). Дан Су, аналитик Morningstar говорит: «Безусловно, юные потребители интересуются уходом за кожей и имеют доступ в интернет … и им может понадобится помощь в выборе правильного продукта. В противном случае они просто будут покупать продукцию, предназначенную для взрослых, что может не полностью удовлетворить их запросы». Он добавляет: «Самая интересная ниша, которая привлекает внимание компаний, инвесторов и бьюти-индустрии — дети в возрасте с восьми до 12 лет». Честный крем Кимберли Хо родилась и выросла в оживленной столице Малайзии Куала-Лумпуре, ее родители — предприниматели, у них своя типография. «Я была буквально «ребенком стартапа», в животе матери, которая таскала коробки, потому что не могла позволить себе никого нанять», — говорит она. В подростковом возрасте она была одержима идеей поступить в школу Лиги плюща, а позже решила подать документы в Стэнфорд, ориентируясь в основном на фотографии кампуса в солнечной Калифорнии на университетском сайте. «В первый раз я побывала в Америке, когда прилетела в Сан-Франциско, чтобы поступить в Стэнфорд», — вспоминает она. Кимберли Хо с чистой, гладкой кожей и игривой улыбкой выглядит как «Блондинка в законе», для которой нет ничего невозможного. Во время первого семестра на экономическом факультете Стэнфорда она смотрела, как ее однокурсники пытались понравиться представителям Goldman Sachs во время университетских «дней карьеры», а уже несколько лет спустя, в 2013 году, стала инвестиционным банкиром в элитной манхэттенской фирме. Еще через несколько лет перешла в компанию по управлению активами Oaktree. В Oaktree Хо работала с несколькими крупными косметическими брендами, и ее насторожили процессы, происходившие на рынке, — судебные иски на миллиарды долларов из-за утаивания рисков для здоровья, наплыв ничем не отличающихся друг от друга марок, проблемы с качеством продукции, которые постоянно замалчивались. Она вспоминает: «Я люблю сферу бьюти, у меня очень чувствительная кожа, и именно отсутствие заботы о потребителях и нечестность некоторых марок вызывали у меня дискомфорт. Момент просветления наступил, когда мои друзья уже создавали семьи и умоляли меня привезти домой в Малайзию баночки известных американских брендов, якобы «надежных и безопасных». Но я-то была инвестором этих брендов и знала, что не такие они надежные, как утверждают». Увидев этот вакуум в сегменте уходовой косметики премиум-сегмента, Хо в 2017 году ушла из Oaktree и запустила свою марку средств для всей семьи — так появился Evereden. 50 лучших дерматологов получили письма от Кимберли Хо с предложением помочь разработать составы для ее продукции. Доктор Джойс Тенг, заведующая отделением детской дерматологии в Стэнфордской медицинской школе, пригласила ее лично представить свою компанию. Концепция Кимберли ей сразу понравилась — у дочери Тенг тяжелая форма экземы. Вскоре Тенг заняла пост старшего научного сотрудника, а позже к ней присоединились еще двое врачей из Гарвардской медицинской школы. Косметические средства не нуждаются в одобрении от Управления по санитарному надзору за качеством пищевых продуктов и медикаментов (FDA), — но не солнцезащитный крем и мазь от экземы. Evereden получила одобрение на эти средства, а команда докторов в штате позволяет утверждать, что все средства в линейке «прошли клинические испытания». Клиенты растут, инвестиции тоже После первого раунда финансирования, проведенного техасской венчурной компанией Sidekick Partners в 2018 году, Evereden запустила линейку продуктов для младенцев. В 2019 году компания выпустила уходовую косметику для мам, которая включала масла для борьбы с растяжками. Преодолев отметку в $1 млн прибыли за первые несколько лет существования, компания начала добавлять в ассортимент средства для ухода за кожей и волосами для детей. «Мы расширили ассортимент по большей части потому, что наши покупатели говорили: «Эй, мой ребенок уже не младенец. И вообще, у меня еще есть старший. У вас есть что-нибудь для таких, как он?» , — говорит Кимберли Хо. Присутствие бренда в нескольких нишевых подкатегориях имеет первостепенное значение для роста, особенно на Amazon. За несколько месяцев после выхода на рынок продукция компании стала лидером в категории «Детские товары для волос» на Amazon — секторе, который был на этой гигантской площадке относительно неосвоенным. А самым быстрорастущим сегментом Evereden стала продукция для подростков. В 2021 году Evereden дважды привлекала инвестиции. По итогам раунда финансирования серии C компания получила $32 млн, список инвесторов возглавила GSR Ventures (Менло-Парк, Калифорния). Большая часть средств была направлена на создание собственной косметической лаборатории и набор команды технологов. «Это нетипично для бьюти-индустрии или уходовой косметики. Только у L'Oréal, Unilever and P&G есть собственные косметические лаборатории», — говорит Кимберли. Большая часть новых косметических брендов, включая проданную компании Elf Beauty за $1 млрд Rhode Beauty от Хейли Бибер, используют услуги сторонних косметических лабораторий и технологов, которые предлагают услуги по разработке формул, параллельно делая то же самое для десятков других компаний. В индустрии считается нормой тратить 18 месяцев на разработку нового продукта с привлечением сторонних компаний....","SPR_COMBO[ru]Как выпускница Стэнфорда зарабатывает $100 млн в год на косметике для подростков Обеденный стол Кимберли Хо почти всегда завален.

mov_7F13C1D100441F95585B55B3DE4496D4,"  Scooter Braun is transitioning his role at HYBE, the South Korean entertainment giant, moving from CEO of HYBE America to an advisory position which will have him joining the HYBE Board of Directors as a director and a senior advisor to chairman and CEO Bang Si-Hyuk. The move marks the end of a five-year run at HYBE, which is home to such K-pop acts as BTS and Katseye. The news was announced to HYBE staffers on Monday when Braun, dialing in from David Geffen's yacht where he is vacationing, notified employees that the move was “in the works for quite some time,” according to a source who adds that the five-year plan was initiated with the sale of Braun's Ithaca Holdings to HYBE in 2021. Braun will remain active in current HYBE projects, like the just-launched girl group Katseye. Braun intimated that he “isn't going anywhere” and will “still help guide” the artists on the HYBE roster. During the call, Braun shared with the staff that, when he set out for a career in music 25 years ago, it was after reading the Geffen biography The Operator. Today, as he closes this chapter of his career, he reminded his colleagues of what he's learned from Geffen: “Follow your dreams and anything can happen.” Braun built his business managing music artists like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, J Balvin, Demi Lovato and The Kid LAROI under the SB Projects banner. In 2024, he stepped away from the management business, announcing his decision on social media, where he noted, “I have been blessed to have had a 'Forrest Gump'-like life while witnessing and taking part in the journeys of some of the most extraordinarily talented people the world has ever seen. I'm constantly pinching myself and asking 'how did I get here?'” The exit from management coincided with a split from Bieber which turned contemptuous, as THR reported in April, due to financial consequences triggered by the cancelation of Bieber's Justice tour in 2022. In not fulfilling his contractual obligation to AEG (the tour's promoter) and completing the concert dates, for which he received a $40 million advance, Bieber was left owing more than $20 million to AEG. Then-manager Braun, through his company, covered what was owed in the form of a loan at a highly favorable (to Bieber) rate. In addition, the two were partnered in a number of other businesses including a record label and film projects. Braun also helped secure a $200 million catalog deal for Bieber's songwriting interests, possibly the largest nest egg in music history for an artist under 30. (Worth noting: Hailey Bieber, who married Justin in 2018, recently sold her Rhode Beauty skincare brand to e.l.f. Beauty for $1 billion; Braun was a seed investor.) THR has learned that a settlement between Braun and Bieber is now completed. “Scooter and Justin squashed their issues and are in a good place,” says a source who adds that Braun's last act at HYBE was to close the book on the squabble and “leave the company, and Justin, in a good position.” Reps for Bieber declined to comment on the settlement. Stepping into the CEO position in Braun's place and leading all day-to-day duties is Isaac Lee, who has been chairman of HYBE Latin America since November of 2023. Lee's new title is chairman and CEO of HYBE Americas. In addition to running HYBE's operations in Mexico, Miami, and Medellin, Lee will also have oversight of Nashville-based Big Machine Label Group (BMLG) and Quality Control Media Holdings, headquartered in Atlanta. While Braun's next move is unclear, HYBE chief Bang Si-Hyuk commented, “Scooter has been an extraordinary partner, a visionary executive, and a true catalyst for cultural exchange. His contributions have been vital in establishing our ambitious presence in the U.S. market. I am deeply grateful for his leadership, his astute instincts and his unwavering passion for artists. We wish him immense success in his exciting next chapter and look forward to continuing our partnership in executing HYBE's global vision.” More in Business Braun also remains one of HYBE's largest individual shareholders. In announcing his new role, Braun said: “Being a part of HYBE and witnessing its remarkable growth has been one of the most inspiring chapters of my professional journey. Chairman Bang is a true visionary and a musical genius. What he has built with HYBE is unparalleled. I am incredibly proud of our collective accomplishments and look forward to supporting Chairman Bang and CEO Jason Jaesang Lee in their continued success as I step into what's next.”","Scooter Braun is transitioning his role at HYBE, the South Korean entertainment giant, moving from CEO of HYBE America to an advisory position which will have him joining the HYBE Board of Directors as a director and a senior advisor to chairman and CEO Bang Si-Hyuk.

tw_sl_5da78be4f42c33a255d7d0bcf2f0f026,"  C elebrities ARE venturing beyond the billboard and the big screen—and into big business. Hailey Bieber, a model married to Justin, recently sold Rhode, her make-up brand, in a deal valued at as much as $1bn. Skims, a shapewear label founded by Kim Kardashian, a reality- TV star, makes $1bn in annual sales and is expected to list on the stockmarket soon. Rihanna is now a billionaire not directly because of her music, but thanks to Fenty Beauty, her make-up label. Ryan Reynolds, a Hollywood actor, is active in everything from telecoms to online privacy. Surprisingly, many of these superstar businesses have become a source of innovative new consumer products. Celebrities have long used their fame to peddle things. Michael Jordan, a basketball player, is thought to have made over $1.5bn from his partnership with Nike over the past 40 years. Nespresso has reportedly paid George Clooney more than $40m to have his mug selling its coffee. Two decades ago Hulk Hogan, a professional wrestler, helped market the “Hulkster” cheeseburger, pre-cooked and frozen for your convenience. The practice continues. This week President Donald Trump launched “Victory 45-47”, a line of fragrances for men and women priced at $249, having launched “Fight Fight Fight” ($199) last year. By contrast, the new superstar brands put the A -list into capitalist. Ms Bieber and co are involved in operations and hold equity stakes of varying sizes in the underlying businesses. Many celebs have begun to rethink the value of traditional endorsement and licensing deals. Social media now give them a line straight to their fans. Direct-to-consumer distribution, meanwhile, has made getting a product to market easier than ever. Given that the real money is in building and owning a brand , rather than advertising, why not launch one instead? This thinking in turn is altering the life-cycle of consumer goods. Just as pharmaceutical giants acquire biotech startups to refresh their drug pipelines, so consumer giants are buying up the most successful celebrity brands. The match makes sense. The hardest part of building a brand is the first 100,000 sales, but the A -list has a fan base that is well disposed towards them and their wares. Once a celebrity brand gets off the ground, a consumer giant has the production and distribution networks to help it grow. Hence the series of deals. Among the first was Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics, a headphones and streaming business co-founded by Dr Dre, a music producer. Many were shocked when the tech giant, which prides itself on in-house research and design, paid around $3bn for the brand in 2014. More recently Diageo, a drinksmaker, has bought a tequila firm co-owned by Mr Clooney, in a deal valued at around $1bn, and a gin distiller partly owned by Mr Reynolds, for up to $610m. Obviously, a famous name is not enough on its own to get a second-rate product flying off the shelves. You need only peer into the bargain bin in any cosmetics shop to spot the remainders of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's beauty products, or Sarah Jessica Parker's scents. Some of Mr Trump's newest offerings may soon join them. According to a perfume-review website, Victory 45-47 for men is “not particularly memorable”. Shoppers today are quick to review products on social media. Fans might try a new lipstick or t -shirt produced by a celebrity. But they will not buy it a second time if they are disappointed. At their best, celebrity brands are innovative, creative—and lucrative for their owners. Yet, just like show business, brutal flops are possible, too. ■ Subscribers to The Economist can sign up to our Opinion newsletter , which brings together the best of our leaders, columns, guest essays and reader correspondence.

Email tips@dailymail.com Abbey Clancy's daughter Sophia showed she has taken after her model mother as she joined her famous family and footballer father Peter Crouch at the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club for day four of Wimbledon on Thursday. The daughter to the famous couple, 14, showed off her resemblance to her mother as she was seen topping up her lip gloss in the crowd. She joined Abbey, 39, and Peter, 44, who looked happier than ever and packed on the PDA with a kiss while sat in Centre Court, as she stepped out in an all white ensemble. For the outing, Sophie put on a very glamorous display as she toted her belongings around in a black leather Miu Miu bag. It appears that she also has her mother's eye for designer accessories, as she accessorised with four Christian Dior cloth bracelets, each worth a whopping £250. To finish her sporting day outfit, Sophia was seen wearing false eyelashes as she applied a layer of Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip gloss. Meanwhile Abbey - who is also a mother to Liberty, nine, Johnny, seven, and Jack, five - looked incredible for the outing as she wore a yellow striped suit. Liverpool football legend Peter, looked handsome as he attended the event in a casual blue shirt. Abbey has had a highly successful modelling career, while she's also branched out into presenting, novel writing and even won Strictly Come Dancing back in 2013. And Sophia has taken nepotism in her stride as she made her modelling debut aged eight when she joined Abbey for a Lipsy shoot. Sophia has reportedly had 'loads of offers' already from agencies as she is being dubbed the 'next Lila Moss' A source told Heat World: 'Sophia is getting lots of offers from modelling agencies. They see her as the next big thing, thanks to her looking like Abbey and having Pete's height. 'She has already done campaigns with her mum, but now big-name agencies are desperate to sign her and turn her into the next Lila Moss.' Centre Court spectators will be watching Jack Draper compete against 2017 Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic and Dan Evans takes on Novak Djokovic. Draper, the current world No4, takes on 2017 Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic this afternoon as he looks to progress past the second round for the first time at SW19. World number one Jannik Sinner is also back in the spotlight, up against Aleksandar Vukic, whilst Iga Swiatek plays Caty McNally in the other Centre Court match. Judy Murray has opened up on the secrets of the Royal Box at Wimbledon as celebrity guests continue to flood into Wimbledon. While there are 18 Championship grass courts at SW19, all eyes are often on the historic Centre Court, which plays host to the best stars the sport has to offer as they compete for glory. Centre Court boasts nearly 15,000 seats, meaning lucky punters can be seen cheering on their favourites, and are joined by guests in the Royal Box at around lunchtime each day. So far this week, the likes of John Cena, Thomas Tuchel and Olivia Rodrigo have all been present, with all three part of a star-studded line-up in the Box on Wednesday. On Tuesday Judy, renown for her coaching work in the sport and her support for tennis-playing sons Andy and Jamie, made an appearance. Before her trip, she opened up on what it is like in the Royal Box on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with The National Lottery on Virgin Radio UK. 'Royal Boxing should be a verb, shouldn't it?' she said.' It should be a summer verb.' She added: 'Well, you arrive usually around 11.30, so you go upstairs, they have a champagne reception, then you go in for lunch and you could be sitting beside absolutely anybody at lunch. There's no seating plan, it's just as you go into the room. 'It's in the clubhouse of the All England Club, and the first year that I went I took my mum, of course, and we sat with Jack Nicklaus. I sat with a few years ago a lady who was the first female Spitfire pilot. I mean it's just you could be with absolutely anybody and the stories are fascinating. 'It's really tough when the sun comes round because there's no escape. 'It's actually I think worse for the guys because they have to wear a jacket and tie and they're not allowed to take the jacket off unless the royalty in the box takes their jacket off first. That's the protocol.'","Have YOU got a story?

Or when you're obsessed with the quirky monster doll, Labubu, that everyone on social media seems to own? For some, the answer is simple: don't buy it. But for others - especially those stubborn, brand-loving souls - Indian markets have found a workaround. If you can't get the first copy, just buy the fifth one. And no, these aren't dupes with witty name changes or altered packaging. These are full-blown counterfeits: same branding, identical packaging, but at a mere fraction of the price. We took a deep dive into these murky online markets to find out what's being sold, how they are being sold, and more importantly, why so many people are buying them. But before we unpack all that, let's rewind a bit. The Rise Of India's Counterfeit Culture Counterfeit goods aren't new in India. They've existed in various forms for decades. When globalisation opened the floodgates to international brands, a majority of Indians found themselves unable to afford the real thing. The demand was high, but supply (at least the genuine kind) was out of reach. Naturally, the market responded in its own cheeky way. Think of places like D'manoj Pizza knocking off Domino's. Even when Domino's caught wind of the viral video of their doppelganger, their response was just as cheeky: ""Yahan ka address milega? (Can we get the address?)"" (Not a copyright claim) Today, that spirit has spilled across industries, from fast food to fashion to beauty. Markets like Sarojini Nagar in Delhi, Esplanade in Kolkata and Linking Road in Mumbai are prime examples, brimming with off-brand versions of luxury items. These IRL knock-offs often tweak a letter here, a logo there, or at least get the shade of lipstick slightly off. For beauty products though, the compromises run deeper - especially when it comes to ingredients and safety. But the game has changed online. Unlike the local bazaar, where, you know you're buying a knock-off, e-commerce marketplaces and social media are now peddling products that look identical to the original. Meesho, Facebook Marketplace, Amazon, Instagram... everyone is on it, and everyone is in on it. How These Fake Markets Operate Meesho Meesho is notorious (and simultaneously beloved) for offering bargain-basement prices. The brand claims this is possible because it eliminates middlemen, connects resellers directly to manufacturers, and focuses on lesser-known brands. But this has created the perfect breeding ground for fake products - especially viral beauty items. Take Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip treatment, for instance. Not officially available in India, but somehow being sold on Meesho for less than Rs 500. We even found fake Dior and Gisou lip oils, sold in nearly identical packaging but with slightly altered names. Facebook Marketplace It might not be trending in urban Gen Z circles, but Facebook Marketplace (FMP) is still massive. With over a billion global users shopping every month, it's a hotspot for everything from houseplants to handbags - and now, counterfeit beauty products in India. It's not just about fake luxury either. Some sellers offer bizarrely cheap prices for products that shouldn't even be in India, let alone available at that price. The sheer scale of the platform makes it easy for scamsters to thrive with little scrutiny. Instagram Instagram, Meta's glamorous baby, has become a thriving hub for small business sellers, even in India. Unfortunately, many of them are hawking knock-off makeup and skincare products via Reels. Some don't even bother to change the names-they rely on flashy visuals and discounted prices to hook unsuspecting users. The perfume industry is especially saturated with counterfeit sellers offering half-price on these bottles that may look legit but aren't even close.

Hailey Bieber की Rhode Lip Treatment जो इंडिया में आती ही नहीं, Meesho पर सिर्फ 500 रुपए में मिल रही है. यहां तक कि Dior और Gisou के भी नकली लिप ऑयल्स मिल जाते हैं, बस नाम में हल्का सा फर्क. Facebook Marketplace Facebook Marketplace भी पीछे नहीं है. यहां घर के पौधों से लेकर हैंडबैग्स तक सब बिकता है - अब नकली ब्यूटी प्रोडक्ट्स भी. यहां इतने सस्ते दाम में प्रोडक्ट्स मिलते हैं कि यकीन करना मुश्किल हो जाए. Instagram Instagram भी अब नकली मेकअप बेचने वालों का हॉटस्पॉट बन गया है. यहां Reels के जरिए लोग बिना नाम बदले ही ब्रांड्स की हूबहू कॉपी बेच रहे हैं. खासतौर पर परफ्यूम्स में नकली सामान की भरमार है.

Online Beauty Market Truth: सोचिए, आप इंडिया में रहते हैं. आपकी ख्वाहिश है कि आप दुनिया का बेस्‍ट लिप ट्रीटमेंट करवा सकें. लेकिन आपके पास न तो कोई रिश्तेदार है जो विदेश में रहता है और न ही आपके पास हजारों रुपए का हैली बीबर का रोड लिप ट्रीटमेंट खरीदने का बजट है. मेकअप (Online Makeup Kit) की बात न करके दूसरे प्रोडक्ट्स की बात करते हैं. जैसे हो सकता है आपको सोशल मीडिया पर वायरल हो रहे उस अजीब से दिखने वाले Labubu Monster Doll से प्यार हो गया है, जो हर किसी के पास है. लेकिन ये इतनी महंगी है कि आप अफोर्ड नहीं करना चाहते तो आप क्या करेंगे. कुछ लोग आपको सलाह देंगे कि बजट नहीं है तो खरीदना ही क्यों? लेकिन कुछ लोग ऐसे होते हैं जो जिद्दी और ब्रांड्स के दीवाने होते हैं. उनके लिए इंडिया में एक तरीका मिल ही जाता है. असली चीज नहीं मिल रही? कोई बात नहीं, उसकी नकल यानी कॉपी (Beauty Product First Copy) मिल जाएगी. जिसे डुप्लीकेट नहीं कहा जा सकता. ये पूरी की पूरी नकली चीजें होती हैं, जिसमें वही ब्रांडिंग, वही पैकिंग होती है, बस दाम एकदम सस्ते होते हैं. ऑनलाइन मार्केट में ये चीजें भरी पड़ी है. एनडीटीवी ने ऑनलाइन मार्केट की तहत तक जाकर इन चीजों का खंगाला और जाना कि लोग क्या खरीद रहे हैं. यकीन मानिए बहुत दिलचस्प फेक्ट्स निकलकर सामने आए इंडिया में नकली सामानों का पुराना खेल (Fake Beauty Product Online) भारत में नकली सामान कोई नई बात नहीं है. जब ग्लोबल ब्रांड्स इंडिया में आए, तो असली सामान का सपना देखना भी महंगा हो गया. जब मांग ज्यादा थी, लेकिन असली चीजें दूर थीं, तो बाजार ने भी अपनी 'देसी जुगाड़' लगा दी. जैसे D'manoj Pizza, जो Domino's Pizza की हूबहू कॉपी था. जब Domino's को पता चला, तो उन्होंने भी इस पर मजेदार रिएक्शन दिया और लिखा, ""भाई, इसका एड्रेस मिलेगा?"" आज ये खेल हर इंडस्ट्री में फैल चुका है - फूड से लेकर फैशन और ब्यूटी तक. दिल्ली का सरोजिनी नगर, कोलकाता का एस्प्लानेड, मुंबई का लिंकिंग रोड - हर जगह ब्रांड्स की नकली कॉपी खुलेआम बिकती हैं. यहां दुकानदार थोड़ी सी स्पेलिंग बदल देते हैं, लोगो थोड़ा घुमा देते हैं या लिपस्टिक का शेड हल्का बदल देते हैं. लेकिन ब्यूटी प्रोडक्ट्स में मामला खतरनाक होता है, क्योंकि यहां सिर्फ लुक्स नहीं, सेहत भी जुड़ी होती है. ऑनलाइन मार्केट में अब खेल ज्यादा बड़ा है अब तो गेम ऑनलाइन शिफ्ट हो गया है. पहले लोकल मार्केट में पता रहता था कि आप नकली चीज़ खरीद रहे हैं, पर ऑनलाइन सब कुछ असली जैसा लगता है. Meesho, Facebook Marketplace, Instagram, Amazon… सब पर नकली चीजें बिक रही हैं. और सबसे बड़ी बात - लोग खरीद भी रहे हैं. Meesho Meesho पर सस्ते सामान की भरमार है. कंपनी कहती है कि ये सीधे मैन्युफैक्चरर से सामान दिलवाते हैं. पर असल में ये नकली प्रोडक्ट्स का अड्डा बन गया है, खासतौर पर ब्यूटी प्रोडक्ट्स का. Hailey Bieber की Rhode Lip Treatment जो इंडिया में आती ही नहीं, Meesho पर सिर्फ 500 रुपए में मिल रही है. यहां तक कि Dior और Gisou के भी नकली लिप ऑयल्स मिल जाते हैं, बस नाम में हल्का सा फर्क. Facebook Marketplace Facebook Marketplace भी पीछे नहीं है. यहां घर के पौधों से लेकर हैंडबैग्स तक सब बिकता है - अब नकली ब्यूटी प्रोडक्ट्स भी. यहां इतने सस्ते दाम में प्रोडक्ट्स मिलते हैं कि यकीन करना मुश्किल हो जाए. Instagram Instagram भी अब नकली मेकअप बेचने वालों का हॉटस्पॉट बन गया है. यहां Reels के जरिए लोग बिना नाम बदले ही ब्रांड्स की हूबहू कॉपी बेच रहे हैं. खासतौर पर परफ्यूम्स में नकली सामान की भरमार है.

The 59-year-old actor has heaped praise on model Hailey, 28, after she sold off her Rhode beauty brand for the massive sum. Speaking on The Adam Corolla Show podcast, he said: ""The cool part of it is she's super smart, smart in business. ""Succeeded as a model prior to everything she's doing now.

Hailey Bieber launches skincare lipbalm for her brand Rhode Credit: Hailey Bieber/Instagram Since then the trend has continued apace, with stars from Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (men's skincare) and Emma Watson (gin) to Sir David Beckham (supplements) and Wiz Khalifa (mushroom-growing kits) all taking part. In May Hailey Bieber, wife of Justin Bieber, a pop star, sold her make-up brand Rhode to e.l.f. Beauty, a cosmetics firm, for as much as $1b. As the boundary between retail and social media blurs, celebrities are reshaping the world of consumer goods. The proliferation of celebrity brands is partly a reflection of changes in the media industry. In decades past, the business of communicating with consumers was largely intermediated by a handful of television channels, radio stations and print publications. No more. These days, says Douglas Holt, a marketing guru, every social-media account is a channel of its own. That has allowed celebrities to engage directly with their fans. Ms Kardashian has over 350m followers on Instagram. She frequently wears and talks about Skims online. “Kim is a phenomenal creative director,” says Jens Grede, her co-founder, “but she's also a one-woman media powerhouse.” According to Launchmetrics, an analytics firm, Skims last year generated more than $US600m in “media impact value”, a gauge of the monetary benefit of online posts, press coverage and other media exposure. That was eight times as much as for Spanx, a rival shapewear brand. Not only are celebrities now able to communicate directly with their fans. They can sell directly to them, too. Fledgling brands no longer need to sell via big retailers, who take a cut of profits, or to open physical stores, which involves enormous upfront investment. To sell online, they do not even need to go through e-commerce platforms like Amazon. Tools such as those offered by Shopify, a Canadian software firm, have made it easier than ever to build an e-commerce site or mobile app. Social-media platforms such as TikTok now allow brands to sell directly to users, too. Direct-to-consumer sales have risen to account for around one-seventh of e-commerce globally, according to NIQ, a data provider. Anita Balchandani of McKinsey, a consultancy, reckons they make up as much as 100 per cent of revenue in the early days of a typical celebrity brand, dropping to 30-60 per cent as firms expand and add third-party distribution. Of course, not every celebrity brand takes off. The Honest Company, a maker of baby and beauty products co-founded by Jessica Alba, an actress, has lost three-quarters of its market value since listing its shares in 2021. Alex Griffin, marketing chief for On, a sportswear brand worn by tennis player Roger Federer and actress Zendaya, says there is a reason many stars still opt for endorsements instead of starting their own brands: “It's not that easy.” Picking the right type of product matters. Clothes and booze are things people often buy for what they symbolise, rather than their functionality, says Sandra Cariglio of ReD Associates, an advisory firm. That makes them safer bets for celebrities. Attractive stars may naturally find it easy to sell beauty products, too. It helps that the production of cosmetics is easy to outsource to white-label manufacturers, as it is for fragrances. Jill Avery of Harvard Business School adds that products need to “fit” the celebrity's own brand. Fans buy make-up from Ms Bieber because she has long shared beauty tips online, and shapewear from Ms Kardashian because she is known for her curves. Asked why he is launching a running app, Mo Farah, an athlete with four Olympic gold medals to his name, says simply: “That's all I know.”...","The EconomistTHE ECONOMIST: As the boundary between retail and social media blurs, celebrities are reshaping the world of consumer goods.

mov_D343F147D32A987282077568959FE4DC,"  SUMMER CALLING: Hailey Bieber is taking her billion-dollar beauty brand Rhode on vacation. Rhode has taken over the beach club Gran Folies in Majorca, Spain, from Wednesday to July 23 with gray and yellow sun loungers, towels, ice cream treats and beach inflatables. “Rhode summer club has lived on my brand vision board since the earliest days of building Rhode. Bringing this world to life has been such a fun and fulfilling journey,” Bieber told WWD. “Summertime really captures the essence of the Rhode vibe, and I'm so proud to be unveiling the dreamy, sun-soaked 'Lemontini' universe we've created. We've always loved connecting with our community through unexpected, IRL experiences, so we knew this had to feel really special — something that truly reflects the imagery and inspiration behind the product launch,” she added. The pop-up is a result of Rhode's success with immersive experiences, such as its photo booth that has touched down in Los Angeles, New York, London and Ibiza last year. To get in the summer mood, the brand unveiled its latest Peptide Lip Tint, the Lemontini, inspired by the citrusy summer cocktail that naturally fits into Rhode's beach club. “The Rhode beach club exemplifies how we like to bring our products to market in a disruptive, exciting way. We build a visual world around our innovation to delight and get the community excited about what we are launching and then pair this with a physical, immersive, IRL experience to showcase this world for our community to see, touch, feel and be a part of,” said Lauren Ratner, Rhode's cofounder, president and chief brand officer. “We wanted to create a new kind of experience this summer for our European audience to experience the world of Rhode like never before,” she added, referring to the company's branded beach loungers, cozy towels, sun umbrellas and sporty water bottles. More in Lifestyle The beach club project has been in the making for over a year and in the process, Rhode Futures Foundation has teamed with Associació Tardor, a shelter in Majorca that helps fight poverty and social exclusion in the region. The foundation has made a donation to Associació Tardor to support the shelter's kitchen improvements, lockers for residents and monthly food budget. As reported, Bieber has been fixating on summer and what she wants to put out. “My vision has been clear for months about what the world of Rhode summer is going to look like. I have a whole world that's coming and ready to go, just think very European, beautiful summer,” she told WWD last month.","SUMMER CALLING: Hailey Bieber is taking her billion-dollar beauty brand Rhode on vacation. Rhode has taken over the beach club Gran Folies in Majorca, Spain, from Wednesday to July 23 with gray and yellow sun loungers, towels, ice cream treats and beach inflatables. “Rhode summer club has lived on my brand vision board since the earliest days of building Rhode. Bringing this world to life has been such a fun and fulfilling journey,” Bieber told WWD. “Summertime really captures the essence of the Rhode vibe, and I'm so proud to be unveiling the dreamy, sun-soaked 'Lemontini' universe we've created. We've always loved connecting with our community through unexpected, IRL experiences, so we knew this had to feel really special — something that truly reflects the imagery and inspiration behind the product launch,” she added. The pop-up is a result of Rhode's success with immersive experiences, such as its photo booth that has touched down in Los Angeles, New York, London and Ibiza last year.

El body highlighter de fentybeauty es nuestro secreto para brillar literalmente bajo el sol, mientras que el jelly stick de cocoa es la solución rápida (y luminosa) para hidratar en movimiento.

En moda, las sandalias cangrejeras confirman que la nostalgia sigue marcando el paso, y sí, las queremos en todos los colores. El bikini de skims con print de cocodrilo es el traje de baño que necesitábamos este #verano: favorecedor, cool y sin complicaciones.

mov_A2D8CC736AC52E156E7FA42BBFC11DC4,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Las estrellas usan su fama para crear prósperos negocios, según el semanario británico. Desde bebidas gaseosas y calzado hasta fragancias, a lo largo de los años los famosos han vendido de todo. En el pasado, la mayoría de las estrellas se conformaban con prestar sus rostros a campañas publicitarias a cambio de un poco de dinero extra. Algunos más emprendedores fueron un paso más allá y participaban en el diseño de los productos que promocionaban. En los años 80, un encuentro casual en un avión entre Jane Birkin, actriz británica, y un alto ejecutivo de Hermès, una marca de lujo, dio lugar a la creación del bolso Birkin. Por la misma época, Michael Jordan, la estrella del basquetbol, se asoció con Nike, una marca deportiva, para lanzar la línea de zapatillas deportivas Air Jordan. Sin embargo, más recientemente un número creciente de famosos ha optado por crear empresas de consumo propias. En la última década, los famosos, desde Beyoncé y Rihanna hasta George Clooney y Harry Styles, han lanzado líneas de belleza, marcas de bebidas alcohólicas, de ropa y mucho más. Un estudio realizado en 2023 por la empresa inmobiliaria JLL reveló que alrededor de tres quintas partes de las marcas minoristas de famosos en Estados Unidos se habían fundado en los seis años anteriores. Desde entonces, la tendencia ha continuado a buen ritmo, con la participación de estrellas como Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (cuidado de la piel masculina) y Emma Watson (ginebra), sir David Beckham (suplementos) y Wiz Khalifa (kits para cultivar setas). En mayo, Hailey Bieber, esposa de Justin Bieber, estrella del pop, vendió su marca de maquillaje Rhode a la firma de cosméticos e.l.f. Beauty por nada menos que US$ 1,000 millones. A medida que se difumina la frontera entre el comercio minorista y las redes sociales, los famosos están remodelando el mundo de los bienes de consumo. La proliferación de marcas de famosos es en parte un reflejo de los cambios en la industria de los medios de comunicación. En décadas pasadas, comunicarse con los consumidores estaba intermediado en gran medida por un puñado de canales de televisión, emisoras de radio y publicaciones impresas. Ya no. Hoy en día, dice Douglas Holt, un gurú de la mercadotecnia, cada cuenta de las redes sociales es un canal propio. Esto ha permitido a los famosos relacionarse directamente con sus fans. Kim Kardashian tiene más de 350 millones de seguidores en Instagram. A menudo usa Skims y habla de ellos en línea. “Kim es una directora creativa fenomenal”, dice Jens Grede, su cofundador, “pero también es una potencia mediática en solitario”. Según Launchmetrics, una empresa de análisis, el año pasado Skims generó más de US$ 600 millones en “valor de impacto mediático”, un indicador del beneficio monetario de las publicaciones online, la cobertura de prensa y otros tipos de exposición mediática. Esta cifra es ocho veces superior a la de Spanx, una marca rival de ropa moldeadora. Ahora los famosos no solo pueden comunicarse directamente con sus admiradores. También pueden venderles directamente. Las marcas emergentes ya no necesitan vender a través de grandes minoristas, que se llevan una parte de los beneficios, ni abrir tiendas físicas, lo que supone una enorme inversión inicial. Para vender en línea, ni siquiera necesitan pasar por plataformas de comercio electrónico como Amazon. Las herramientas como las que ofrece Shopify, una empresa de software canadiense, han facilitado más que nunca la creación de un sitio de comercio electrónico o una aplicación móvil. Las plataformas de redes sociales como TikTok también permiten ahora a las marcas vender directamente a los usuarios. Las ventas directas al consumidor han aumentado hasta representar alrededor de una séptima parte del comercio electrónico mundial, según NIQ, un proveedor de datos. Anita Balchandani, de la consultora McKinsey, calcula que representan hasta el 100% de los ingresos en los primeros días de una marca típica de famosos, y que descienden al 30%-60% a medida que las empresas se expanden y añaden la distribución por terceros. Por supuesto, no todas las marcas de famosos despegan. The Honest Company, fabricante de productos de belleza y para bebés cofundada por la actriz Jessica Alba, ha perdido tres cuartas partes de su valor de mercado desde que cotizó en bolsa en 2021. Alex Griffin, jefe de mercadotecnia de On, una marca de ropa deportiva que visten el tenista Roger Federer y la actriz Zendaya, dice que hay una razón por la que muchas estrellas siguen optando por los patrocinios en lugar de crear sus propias marcas: “No es tan fácil”. Elegir el tipo de producto adecuado es importante. La ropa y la bebida son cosas que la gente suele comprar por lo que simbolizan, más que por su funcionalidad, dice Sandra Cariglio, de ReD Associates, una empresa de asesoría. Eso los convierte en apuestas más seguras para los famosos. Naturalmente, a las estrellas atractivas también les resulta fácil vender productos de belleza. Ayuda que la producción de cosméticos sea fácil de subcontratar a fabricantes de marca blanca, como ocurre con las fragancias. Jill Avery, de la Harvard Business School, añade que los productos tienen que “encajar” con la propia marca del famoso. Las fans compran maquillaje a Hailey Bieber porque lleva mucho tiempo compartiendo consejos de belleza en Internet, y ropa moldeadora a Kim Kardashian porque es conocida por sus curvas. Cuando se le pregunta por qué lanza una aplicación para correr, Mo Farah, atleta con cuatro medallas de oro olímpicas a sus espaldas, dice sencillamente a The Economist: “Es lo único que sé”. Aun así, algunos famosos parecen capaces de vender cualquier cosa. Ryan Reynolds, estrella de comedias románticas convertido en superhéroe malhablado, se convirtió en 2019 en el rostro de Mint Mobile, una empresa de telecomunicaciones, tras adquirir alrededor del 25% del negocio. El año pasado, T-Mobile, un rival mayor, compró la empresa matriz de Mint por unos US$ 1,300 millones. En 2021, Reynolds se hizo con el Wrexham A.F.C., un equipo de fútbol galés en apuros, por 2 millones de libras (US$ 2.7 millones) junto con otro actor. La mejora en los resultados del equipo —y un documental ganador de un premio Emmy coproducido por Reynolds— han aumentado considerablemente su fama. Ahora se dice que el club está recaudando dinero con una valoración de hasta 350 millones de libras. Para los famosos que se dedican a los bienes de consumo, tener un producto decente es esencial. La atención en línea de la que gozan las marcas de famosos viene acompañada de un escrutinio añadido. Goop, una marca de estilo de vida fundada por Gwyneth Paltrow, actriz ganadora de un Oscar, ha sido atacada por hacer afirmaciones sin base científica sobre sus productos....","SPR_COMBO[es]Las estrellas usan su fama para crear prósperos negocios, según el semanario británico.

En décadas pasadas, comunicarse con los consumidores estaba intermediado en gran medida por un puñado de canales de televisión, emisoras de radio y publicaciones impresas. Ya no. Hoy en día, dice Douglas Holt, un gurú de la mercadotecnia, cada cuenta de las redes sociales es un canal propio. Esto ha permitido a los famosos relacionarse directamente con sus fans. Kim Kardashian tiene más de 350 millones de seguidores en Instagram. A menudo usa Skims y habla de ellos en línea. “Kim es una directora creativa fenomenal”, dice Jens Grede, su cofundador, “pero también es una potencia mediática en solitario”. Según Launchmetrics, una empresa de análisis, el año pasado Skims generó más de US$ 600 millones en “valor de impacto mediático”, un indicador del beneficio monetario de las publicaciones online, la cobertura de prensa y otros tipos de exposición mediática. Esta cifra es ocho veces superior a la de Spanx, una marca rival de ropa moldeadora. Ahora los famosos no solo pueden comunicarse directamente con sus admiradores. También pueden venderles directamente. Las marcas emergentes ya no necesitan vender a través de grandes minoristas, que se llevan una parte de los beneficios, ni abrir tiendas físicas, lo que supone una enorme inversión inicial. Para vender en línea, ni siquiera necesitan pasar por plataformas de comercio electrónico como Amazon. Las herramientas como las que ofrece Shopify, una empresa de software canadiense, han facilitado más que nunca la creación de un sitio de comercio electrónico o una aplicación móvil. Las plataformas de redes sociales como TikTok también permiten ahora a las marcas vender directamente a los usuarios. Las ventas directas al consumidor han aumentado hasta representar alrededor de una séptima parte del comercio electrónico mundial, según NIQ, un proveedor de datos. Anita Balchandani, de la consultora McKinsey, calcula que representan hasta el 100% de los ingresos en los primeros días de una marca típica de famosos, y que descienden al 30%-60% a medida que las empresas se expanden y añaden la distribución por terceros. Por supuesto, no todas las marcas de famosos despegan. The Honest Company, fabricante de productos de belleza y para bebés cofundada por la actriz Jessica Alba, ha perdido tres cuartas partes de su valor de mercado desde que cotizó en bolsa en 2021. Alex Griffin, jefe de mercadotecnia de On, una marca de ropa deportiva que visten el tenista Roger Federer y la actriz Zendaya, dice que hay una razón por la que muchas estrellas siguen optando por los patrocinios en lugar de crear sus propias marcas: “No es tan fácil”. Elegir el tipo de producto adecuado es importante. La ropa y la bebida son cosas que la gente suele comprar por lo que simbolizan, más que por su funcionalidad, dice Sandra Cariglio, de ReD Associates, una empresa de asesoría. Eso los convierte en apuestas más seguras para los famosos. Naturalmente, a las estrellas atractivas también les resulta fácil vender productos de belleza. Ayuda que la producción de cosméticos sea fácil de subcontratar a fabricantes de marca blanca, como ocurre con las fragancias. Jill Avery, de la Harvard Business School, añade que los productos tienen que “encajar” con la propia marca del famoso. Las fans compran maquillaje a Hailey Bieber porque lleva mucho tiempo compartiendo consejos de belleza en Internet, y ropa moldeadora a Kim Kardashian porque es conocida por sus curvas. Cuando se le pregunta por qué lanza una aplicación para correr, Mo Farah, atleta con cuatro medallas de oro olímpicas a sus espaldas, dice sencillamente a The Economist: “Es lo único que sé”. Aun así, algunos famosos parecen capaces de vender cualquier cosa. Ryan Reynolds, estrella de comedias románticas convertido en superhéroe malhablado, se convirtió en 2019 en el rostro de Mint Mobile, una empresa de telecomunicaciones, tras adquirir alrededor del 25% del negocio. El año pasado, T-Mobile, un rival mayor, compró la empresa matriz de Mint por unos US$ 1,300 millones. En 2021, Reynolds se hizo con el Wrexham A.F.C., un equipo de fútbol galés en apuros, por 2 millones de libras (US$ 2.7 millones) junto con otro actor. La mejora en los resultados del equipo —y un documental ganador de un premio Emmy coproducido por Reynolds— han aumentado considerablemente su fama. Ahora se dice que el club está recaudando dinero con una valoración de hasta 350 millones de libras. Para los famosos que se dedican a los bienes de consumo, tener un producto decente es esencial. La atención en línea de la que gozan las marcas de famosos viene acompañada de un escrutinio añadido. Goop, una marca de estilo de vida fundada por Gwyneth Paltrow, actriz ganadora de un Oscar, ha sido atacada por hacer afirmaciones sin base científica sobre sus productos....",2025-07-09 10:03:00,es,WEB,,,,717d736b7ad0956f87e8fbd7a293e77a,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This is a comprehensive journalistic article about celebrity brands, which happens to mention Rhode as one example.

mov_DC94EA846D6FCA5D7C6F8B6307A2776E,"  Ulta Beauty's new chief executive officer Kecia Steelman continues to make significant moves, this time snapping up Space NK from investment firm Manzanita Capital. Terms of the deal were not disclosed apart from that the purchase was funded with cash on hand and capacity under Ulta's existing credit facility. More from WWD Press reports from last year suggested Manzanita was searching for a deal valued between 300 million pounds and 400 million pounds. Space NK, which has 83 stores in the U.K. and Ireland, will operate as a stand-alone subsidiary of Ulta Beauty and will continue to be led by its existing management team, including CEO Andy Lightfoot. “Today's announcement marks an exciting step forward for Ulta Beauty's global expansion efforts, adding the U.K. market to our existing planned openings in Mexico and the Middle East later this year,” said Steelman. “Space NK is a beloved brand with a strong operating model and customer loyalty, and we couldn't be more thrilled to welcome the brand into the Ulta Beauty family.” Space NK was founded in Covent Garden in 1993 by Nicky Kinnaird as a glossy destination for niche, international brands — many of them skin care — that were difficult to find in the U.K. It had been part of Manzanita Capital for 23 years. Reports that the firm was trying to sell Space NK emerged in April 2024. It previously tried to off-load it in 2018, before deciding to pull the retailer off the market. Bill Fisher, CEO and founder of Manzanita Capital, said: “I have every confidence that Ulta Beauty and this terrific management team will take Space NK to new heights.” Lightfoot added that he was excited by the opportunity to join Ulta Beauty and “benefit from its scale, brand relationships and resources.” “This acquisition sets both companies on a path to further success and importantly, enables us to reach more beauty enthusiasts throughout the world at scale. As a collective force of talented, passionate teams, I'm confident we will take Space NK to new heights,” he continued. The U.S. wholesale division of Space NK, which entails roughly 600 points of distribution across Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, Hudson's Bay and the company's shop-in-shop collaboration with Walmart and Beauty SpaceNK, was acquired by PCA Companies in June 2024. Since taking the reins as CEO of Ulta at the beginning of this year, Steelman has been executing its international expansion. Later this year Ulta will debut in Mexico through a joint venture with Axo, before arriving in the Middle East via a licensing agreement with Alshaya Group. In the Middle East, the first locations will be in Dubai and Kuwait City, with one store in each location to begin with, although the strategy is to expand quickly. It's the same story in Mexico. “We're getting ready to launch in the back half of 2025 for Mexico, and it will probably be in the later half of the year for the Middle East. For Mexico, it's a joint venture with Axo. We're very excited about our partnership. The teams are working very well together. We believe we can get 10 stores open in a pretty short period of time,” Steelman said during an April interview with WWD. “In regards to the Middle East, that's actually a licensed agreement that we're doing with Alshaya Group. We've talked to Alshaya Group for quite some time, and feel like they're a fantastic partner for us to bring our brand to life in the Middle East.” Thursday's announcement that Ulta is acquiring Spake NK is yet another sign that beauty M&A is picking up after a lengthy slowdown. Other recent deals include L'Oréal snapping up Medik8 and Color Wow, E.l.f. Beauty buying Hailey Bieber's Rhode and Unilever's purchase of Dr. Squatch. Other beauty brands that have been in the market for some time will no doubt be hoping that this thawing means they will soon have some success. Best of WWD Sign up for WWD's Newsletter.

mov_DD2B068A853DB6239ED9C4B0676A8941,"  July 11th, 2025 ( The Motley Fool  - Delivered by  Newstex ) Key Points Amazon has grown to become one of the world's largest companies because it isn't afraid to innovate and it invests to win. Dutch Bros and Cava are two of the best restaurant expansion stories out there. Philip Morris International transformed its business with an acquisition, and e.l.f. Beauty is looking to do the same. When it comes to consumer-facing businesses with long-term growth potential, a few companies stand out. While technology stocks get a lot of attention, and deservedly so, the consumer space is also full of solid companies with long growth trajectories. Here's a look at five consumer-focused stocks built for growth to buy and hold for the the long haul. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocksto buy right now. Learn More Amazon There is a reason why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has grown to become one of the world's largest companies: It isn't afraid to innovate and it invests to win. Years of heavy investment in logistics and automation continue to pay off, and  artificial intelligence (AI) is only making the company more efficient. The company has built out a regionalized fulfillment network designed to cut shipping distances and reduce costs, and now it is using AI to enhance this even more. The company is using AI to predict the best routes and even to make it easier for drivers to navigate complex drop-offs at places like large apartment buildings. It's also using AI to predict the best warehouses to store items in order to reduce shipping mileage and times. On top of that, it has invested heavily in robots, that with advancements in AI are now able to take on increasingly complex tasks. Its robots aren't just moving boxes and lifting heavy items, some have a sense of touch and can grab items in tough-to-reach places and others can spot damaged items, helping the company save money on costly returns. At the same time, Amazon continues to be a  cloud computing leader with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has created software tools that make it easy for developers to build and deploy AI models and tools, while the company has also developed its own proprietary chips for AI training and inference that give it a cost advantage over off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs). Put it all together, and Amazon is building one of the most powerful and defensible platforms on the planet. e.l.f. Beauty e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) already rewrote the playbook on mass-market cosmetics, taking massive share over the past few years. Now, the company is going the premium route with its acquisition of Rhode, and the upside is substantial. Rhode has grown to $212 million in sales over the past year with minimal distribution and almost no paid marketing. Plug that into e.l.f.'s distribution network, which includes strong relationships with retailers like Ulta Beauty and Target, and it should be able to take the brand to new heights. Rhode brings with it higher price points and a strong skincare portfolio. That complements e.l.f.'s mass-market cosmetic lines and opens up cross-sell opportunities, as it's common in the beauty industry for consumers to use both prestige and mass products. Meanwhile, Hailey Bieber will stay on as chief creative officer, and e.l.f. will surely want to ramp up Rhode's product offerings. E.l.f. has already shown it knows how to gain share in a crowded market. It continues to expand internationally, and it should have opportunities in other adjacent markets down the road, like fragrance. With its brand-building track record and influencer marketing, e.l.f. has plenty of growth ahead. Dutch Bros One of the best themes to invest in in the consumer space is expansion, and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) has a big opportunity in front of it. The company now has over 1,000 locations and a clear roadmap to grow that to 7,000 over time. But this isn't just an expansion story, as Dutch Bros is also seeing strong traction with same-store sales, which climbed 4.7% last quarter. The company just rolled out mobile ordering, which should boost throughput, and it is finally looking to roll out more food options, an area where it's been notably absent. Breakfast is a massive category, and Dutch Bros has acknowledged that not offering food items during this important daypart has likely cost it sales. If its food pilot proves successful, it could be a significant driver of same-store growth. Between new food offerings and expansion, this is a stock to own for the long haul. Image source: Getty Images. Cava Group Another great restaurant expansion story in progress right now is Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA). The company is replicating what Chipotle Mexican Grill did a decade ago with Tex-Mex, but with Mediterranean food. Its Mediterranean-focused menu is fresh, healthy, and customizable, and consumers are responding. The company has posted four straight quarters of double-digit same-store sales growth, including a 10.8% gain last quarter, powered largely by a 7.5% jump in traffic. The introduction of grilled steak to its menu last year was a game changer, and its menu continues to evolve and improve. Its added higher-margin items like fresh juices, and add-ons are already boosting average tickets. Cava is also experimenting with new dishes and a loyalty program to keep customers coming back. The big story, though, is still geographic expansion....","July 11th, 2025 ( The Motley Fool - Delivered by Newstex ) Key Points Amazon has grown to become one of the world's largest companies because it isn't afraid to innovate and it invests to win.

Here are five monster stocks to buy right now and hold for the next five years or more. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue » 1. Amazon While Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Another behind-the-scenes area where Amazon is a market leader is robotics. The company is the world's largest operator of mobile robots, having just deployed its millionth robot, which is working at one of its fulfillment centers. These robots aren't just moving boxes, they are detecting damaged goods, navigating tight aisles, and even fixing themselves. Meanwhile, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model to coordinate the movement of its entire fleet of robots in order to save time and boost throughput. The company is also using AI to create better delivery routes and make it easier for drivers to find difficult drop-off locations within large apartment or office complexes. All of this is making Amazon more efficient and should lead to strong earnings growth in the years ahead. 2. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) However, the company's bigger opportunity lies in custom AI chips. Broadcom helped Alphabet design its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and now it has multiple customers developing their own custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These chips can offer better efficiency and performance than off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs), and Broadcom has become the primary partner for several top tech companies that are creating their own custom AI ASICs. Broadcom estimates that its three customers furthest along in their development could each deploy 1 million AI chip clusters by fiscal 2027, representing a $60 billion to $90 billion total serviceable addressable market. That's a big potential growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead. 3. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) At the same time, Meta's new AI tools are improving both ad creativity and targeting, leading to better ad performance. Last quarter, ad impressions rose 5% while average price per ad jumped 10%, demonstrating that its platform is becoming more effective for marketers. In addition, Meta has two new monetization opportunities emerging. The company just started serving ads on its popular messaging platform, WhatsApp, which boasts more than 3 billion users. At the same time, it's also begun to gradually serve ads to its new social media platform Threads, which had more than 350 million monthly users as of last quarter and is growing quickly. Between the better monetization of its core platforms and new opportunities with WhatsApp and Threads, Meta has a solid growth outlook over the next several years. 4. Philip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) Internationally, Iqos is gaining strong traction. The company sold more than 37 billion heated tobacco units last quarter, with strong growth in Japan and Europe. Philip Morris recently regained U.S. rights to Iqos and is piloting it in Austin, Texas. Once the FDA clears its latest device, a broader U.S. rollout could begin. Best of all, this would not cannibalize existing sales, since Philip Morris doesn't sell cigarettes in the U.S. What really sets these products apart, though, are their unit economics. Zyn is 6 times more profitable than traditional cigarettes, while Iqos is more than twice as profitable. In addition, Philip Morris tends to use local manufacturing, which shields it from any tariffs. With global cigarette sales still holding up outside the U.S., Philip Morris is a rare growth stock in a defensive industry. 5. E.l.f. Beauty E.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) Rhode was already set to expand into Sephora stores this year, and e.l.f. has strong relationships with retailers Ulta Beauty and Target. Increased distribution is one of the surest ways to increase growth, and e.l.f. will have a long runway of getting Rhode products onto retail shelfs. The deal also diversifies e.l.f. into prestige skincare and cosmetics, complementing its mass-market cosmetics base. That should boost margins and expand its reach to a slightly more affluent demographic. While the company will face tariff headwinds, the Rhode deal should help power strong growth in the years ahead.

Best of all, this would not cannibalize existing sales, since Philip Morris doesn't sell cigarettes in the U.S. What really sets these products apart, though, are their unit economics. Zyn is 6 times more profitable than traditional cigarettes, while Iqos is more than twice as profitable. In addition, Philip Morris tends to use local manufacturing, which shields it from any tariffs. With global cigarette sales still holding up outside the U.S., Philip Morris is a rare growth stock in a defensive industry. 5. E.l.f. Beauty E.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) Rhode was already set to expand into Sephora stores this year, and e.l.f. has strong relationships with retailers Ulta Beauty and Target. Increased distribution is one of the surest ways to increase growth, and e.l.f. will have a long runway of getting Rhode products onto retail shelfs. The deal also diversifies e.l.f. into prestige skincare and cosmetics, complementing its mass-market cosmetics base. That should boost margins and expand its reach to a slightly more affluent demographic. While the company will face tariff headwinds, the Rhode deal should help power strong growth in the years ahead.

mov_30943625CCF322A86DCC0785BC1F1E54,"  By MARIA SHERMAN, AP Music Writer Published: July 11, 2025, 8:22am Share NEW YORK (AP) — Never say never! Justin Bieber surprised fans Friday by releasing “Swag,” his seventh studio album, hours after he teased it on billboards and social media posts. It is his first album since 2021's “Justice” and his first since becoming a father last year. “Inspired by his devotion as a husband and father, this new era of music has fueled a deeper perspective and more reflective sound, resulting in some of his most personal music yet,” Def Jam Recordings said of the 21-track album. Billboards depicting Bieber were found by fans Thursday in Reykjavik, Iceland, and Los Angeles. The singer also shared images of billboards on his official Instagram account along with a tracklist that included song names like “All I Can Take,” “Walking Away,” “Dadz Love” and “Forgiveness.” Recommendations for an intimate new album There's a lot to love across the 21-tracks of the intimate “Swag.” Here are a few choice cuts. 1. “Daises” — The second track on the album may very well be its strongest; an exemplar in Bieber's slow-burn brand of alternative R&B-pop, now anchored with lo-fi guitar. Here, his sweet voice is pronounced — exactly what his most dedicated fans want to hear. 2. “Devotion” ft. Dijon — Dijon is a rising R&B voice; some fans might be familiar with his 2021 debut album “Absolutely” or his contribution to Bon Iver's”SABLE, fABLE” from earlier this year. He makes for a standout collaboration on “Swag,” a sweet song about deepening affection. 3. “Go Baby” – Bieber married the model Hailey Bieber (nee Baldwin) in 2018; she's long been source material for his most loving tracks. “Go Baby” is a standout for that reason. “That's my baby, she's iconic,” he opens the track, “iPhone case, lip gloss on it,” referencing her Rhode skincare and beauty brand, which sold to Elf Beauty in a $1 billion deal. 4. “Walking Away” – Marriage isn't easy; that's clear on “Walking Away,” a slightly-more-uptempo track where Bieber makes his dedication evident. It's the perfect song for dancing in the kitchen with your partner. 5. “All I Can Take” – The throwback opener “All I Can Take” has a vintage groove — echoes of Beiber's early work, now matured to reflect his current adult reality. He sounds as sweet as ever in the pre-chorus, his declaration of “Ooh, baby, don't it feel good? Baby, don't it feel nice? / Ooh, baby, don't it feel good? You don't have to think twice.” Bieber before “Swag” Bieber, the two-time Grammy Award winning singer and Canadian pop idol who revolutionized teen pop and social media fame, is best known for his silky R&B pop lyric tenor, demonstrated on the diamond-selling “Baby,” “Sorry,” and “Stay” with the Kid Laroi. At the beginning of his career, and as a tween, Bieber began working with Usher and the influential music manager Scooter Braun. In 2023, Bieber sold the rights to his music — all six of his albums, including hits like “Sorry” and “Baby” — to Hipgnosis, a U.K-based music investment company. The deal's financial details were not disclosed, but Billboard Magazine reports that the sale was worth an estimated $200 million. In August 2024, Justin and Hailey Bieber announced the birth of their first child, Jack Blues Bieber.","By MARIA SHERMAN, AP Music Writer Published: July 11, 2025, 8:22am Share NEW YORK (AP) — Never say never!

mov_C1B85C0F46589F1EBF72FCB53FDFF366,"  Justin Bieber fans woke up to a blast from the past. On Friday, July 11, the singer released “SWAG,” a surprise album that is his first full-length studio project in four years. Despite no prior announcement, the rollout came together fast. Billboards promoting the album began popping up on Thursday, July 10, across the country, hours before Bieber confirmed the release of his seventh album by posting photos and videos on Instagram. A project months in the making Although the drop was unannounced, “SWAG” had been in the works for quite some time. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Bieber had been holding informal “jam sessions” at his home in recent months. Guests reportedly included his longtime DJ Tay James, musical director HARV, SZA collaborator Carter Lang and Australian artist Eddie Benjamin. Star-studded collaborations and viral nods The album spans 21 tracks and features a wide range of collaborators — including Gunna, Sexyy Red, Cash Cobain, Dijon, Lil B and Eddie Benjamin. Comedian Druski is also featured on three interludes. One track, “STANDING ON BUSINESS,” refers to a viral paparazzi clip from June in which Bieber used the now-memed phrase while confronting the press. Bieber was leaving Soho House Malibu in California in June when the exchange began, as Bieber approached paparazzi near his vehicle. One paparazzo asked the singer if he was afraid of being deported back to Canada amid ICE raids. The expletive-laden, 11-minute video showed a tense back-and-forth between Bieber and the press, where he eventually said, “I'm a human f—— being, you're standing around my car, at the beach!” Bieber added, “It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business, is it?” Themes of faith and vulnerability Beyond the guest list, “SWAG” dives into deeply personal territory. One of the final tracks, “FORGIVENESS,” features gospel legend Marvin Winans and reflects Bieber's long-standing connection to faith. Unbiased. Straight Facts.TM Justin Bieber became the youngest solo artist to achieve five No. 1 albums in the U.S. in 2013. Other songs address the emotional toll of public life and fame. On “THERAPY SESSION,” a skit with Druski, Bieber opens up about feeling overwhelmed. “It's feelin' like, you know, I have had to go through a lot of my struggles as a human,” he says. “As all of us do really publicly. And so people are always askin' if I'm okay. And that starts to really weigh on me.” That sense of emotional transparency also plays out in real life. Bieber recently made headlines amid rumors of tension in his marriage to model and skincare-product founder Hailey Bieber. Us Weekly cited sources who described the relationship as “tense.” Hailey, however, pushed back against the rumors, posting a video to her Instagram Story applying her viral Rhode lip treatment, with her engagement ring front and center. Speculation grew again after Justin posted a cryptic screenshot of a Father's Day text exchange, publicly ending a friendship he called “traumatizing.” “Conflict is a part of relationship,” he wrote. “If you don't like my anger, you don't like me.” Between the lyrics and the Instagram posts, “SWAG” feels like an emotional release, or at least a reset. Either way, it's a success. Hours after its release, “SWAG” shot to No. 1 on the U.S. Apple Music chart. Fans are already watching to see how it performs, since Bieber's last album, “Justice,” held the top spot on the Billboard 200 for two weeks in 2021.

mov_CFB8F23D716EB6EE4D635DA129081ECD,"  Justin Bieber is getting his swag back. The artist, who welcomed his first child with wife Hailey Bieber last year, surprised fans this Thursday by announcing his seventh studio album, Swag, would drop just 24 hours later. Now, the album is here, and it's offering some subtle peeks into the singer's personal life. Much has been said about Bieber in the years since he dropped his last studio album, 2021's Justice. The star famously postponed the album's tour, before canceling it due to exhaustion, making a pledge to prioritize his health. And in recent months, Bieber's erratic behavior, both on social media and in public, has stirred concern among fans and sparked tabloid rumors of everything from an intervention to an impending divorce from Hailey. Bieber isn't directly responding to any of those rumors, but the existence of his new album is prompting speculation from some about whether his more alarming conduct (including a now viral paparazzi rant) may have been just a promotional stunt. We may never know — but here are some insights from Bieber's Swag that could give fans a look at his inner world. Bieber has a 'therapy session' with Druski Swag's “Therapy Session” isn't so much a song as it is an interlude. The track reveals a conversation between Bieber and comedian Druski, in which Druski and Bieber reflect on the singer's public image. “Even sometimes where I know you're trolling, and they don't even understand it, like, 'Oh my God, he's f    ing losin' his mind,” Druski says on the track. “And it's like, 'Nah, I think he's just being a human being. He's enjoying social media like the f   ing rest of us. He's just doing it his own way.” Bieber then tells Druski on the track that because he's had to go through a lot of his struggles publicly, he's constantly being asked if he's OK — which starts to “really weigh” on him. “It starts to make me feel like I'm the one with issues and everyone else is perfect,” Bieber says. On the state of his marriage with Hailey Much has been said about Bieber's relationship with Hailey, who he had a brief relationship with in 2016 before the two reunited and quickly married after a few weeks together in 2018. The couple welcomed their son, Jack Blues Bieber, last year, but their relationship has been plagued with tabloid rumors, fueled occasionally by the couple's social media presence. But whatever drama has — or hasn't — occurred between the couple, Bieber seems to send a strong message on Swag's title track. “Baby, I ain't walking away / You were my diamond Gave you a ring I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,” Bieber sings on the track. More in Entertainment The singer seemingly references the ups and downs of a relationship again in “First Place,” with lyrics like “Oh (All I see is you now, all I see is you now), in the first place / Oh (Don't wanna lose you now), and that's thе worst case.” He also waxes poetic about settling down with his love on “Way It Is,” with lines such as, “I'm dreamin' of reachin' and pullin' you closer / We could settle down / I'm dreamin' of a place that we can go away / Time isn't slowin', and there's nobody around.” Bieber shouts out Hailey's beauty prowess Hailey's skincare company, Rhode, gets a shout-out on the album — specifically, the brand's cellphone case, which comes with a lip gloss holder. “That's my baby, she's iconic, iPhone case, lip gloss on it,” Bieber sings on the track “Go Baby.” But it's not just the lip gloss that gets a shout out: Bieber also clocks the many rumors that have swirled about Hailey on social media, singing, “She keeps 'em talkin', it's comedy, just block it.” He also shares supportive words on the song: “When sunlight turns to shadow and it gets hard to face / Like water to a flower, babe, I know you need the rain / Nothing needs to work out and nothing needs to break / Don't need to pretend that you're OK.” Bieber also makes what might be another reference to Hailey's ability to win with beauty trends on the song “Devotion” with the line, “Your lips and fingernails are all glowing.” Hmm, a possible reference not only to Rhode's lip gloss, but also Hailey's viral glazed doughnut nails? A return to the paparazzi rant Bieber even sampled his own paparazzi rant in “Standing on Business,” another interlude track featuring Druski. Back in June, Bieber was confronted by a paparazzo outside of Soho House in Malibu, resulting in an 11-minute argument between the pop star and videographer, in which Bieber was heard on video saying, “You're not getting it, it's not clocking to you…It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business.” Bieber's words went viral, particularly his line about “standing on business” — which then became a part of the intro to his track of the same name. While “Standing on Business” isn't a song, it is another way for Bieber to playfully poke fun at his recent public drama, with Druski commenting on his proper pronunciation of “business” in the rant. “I'ma start goin' to beach and lookin' for motherf   ers just to say that s  t, too,” Druski joked.","Justin Bieber is getting his swag back.

While “Standing on Business” isn't a song, it is another way for Bieber to playfully poke fun at his recent public drama, with Druski commenting on his proper pronunciation of “business” in the rant. “I'ma start goin' to beach and lookin' for motherf***ers just to say that s**t, too,” Druski joked.",2025-07-11 19:03:37,en,WEB,,,,93f131b6635c64d3ff89d5b02447c5d5,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,This is a legitimate entertainment article about Justin Bieber's new album that happens to mention Rhode (Hailey Bieber's brand) in context.

The 31-year-old singer surprise-released a new album, ""Swag,"" Friday after teasing fans the previous morning with a series of billboards and social media posts. Bieber's first album since 2021's ""Justice,"" the new music prompted an online frenzy and revived a devoted community of Beliebers. From his marriage to his paparazzi encounters, Bieber has faced incredible scrutiny over the last few months, which he addresses head-on in ""Swag."" After listening to all 21 tracks, here are our biggest takeaways. Bieber has incorporated R&B elements in his music since early in his career and embraced the genre fully on the 2013 compilation album ""Journals."" But even after coining R&Bieber in 2019, he's struggled to be taken seriously. When 2020's ""Changes"" received a Grammy nomination for pop vocal album, Bieber expressed his confusion at not being nominated in the R&B category. ""To the Grammys I am flattered to be acknowledged and appreciated for my artistry. I am very meticulous and intentional about my music. With that being said I set out to make an R&B album. ' Changes' was and is an R&B album,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""It is not being acknowledged as an R&B album which is very strange to me. I grew up admiring R&B music and wished to make a project that would embody that sound."" ""To be clear I absolutely love Pop music,"" he added. ""It just wasn't what I set out to make this time around. My gratitude for feeling respected for my work remains and I am honored to be nominated either way."" On ""Swag,"" Bieber shows off his R&B chops. From opening track ""All I Can Take"" and the seemingly SZA-inspired ""Yukon"" to ""Daisies"" (which reportedly features Mk.gee on the guitar), he takes a more intimate approach than on previous albums. But still, longtime fans will hear hints of ""Journals"" and ""Changes"" throughout the project. In one of the album's unconventional moments, comedian Druski comments on Bieber's more ""soulful,"" R&B-infused sound. ""I said this album kinda sound, you got some soul on this album too, bro,"" he says on the interlude track ""Soulful."" ""Your skin white but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you, man."" Since Justin and Hailey Bieber wed in 2018, their marriage has been under a microscope. Divorce rumors circulated within months of them tying the knot, and it didn't help that many fans were still rooting for the singer to get back with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. Bieber's love for his wife is evident throughout his catalog - from 2020's ""All Around Me"" to 2021's ""Hailey."" But in case anyone is still skeptical (they are), Bieber sets the record straight on ""Swag."" On album standout ""Walking Away,"" Bieber gets candid about his relationship troubles but also reaffirms that he's committed to his marriage. ""You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,"" he sings. Elsewhere on the album, he cheers on his wife. On ""Go Baby"" (which lyrically echoes 2021's ""There She Go""), he sings, ""That's my baby, she's iconic, iPhone case, lip gloss on it"" - a reference to the Rhode founder's famous lip gloss-holder phone case. Recently, Hailey sold her skin-care company, which she launched in 2022, to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion. There she goes indeed. The Biebers' pregnancy announcement in May 2024 was accompanied by an unknown instrumental track. Now, fans have identified it as ""Devotion"" featuring Dijon. On the heartwarming track, Bieber sings, ""When your lips and fingernails are all mine / I promise to take my time givin' you devotion."" The singer also celebrates being a father to Jack Blues Bieber, born Aug. 23, 2024, on ""Dadz Love."" As rapper Lil B declares we need ""less hatin'"" and ""more love,"" Bieber repeats the track title (which sounds like ""that's love"") over and over. Soon after the singer announced the surprise album, fans flocked to social media to express their excitement. ""New album - bieber fever hitting like it's 2010,"" TikTok user @jennyboba posted to the will.i.am collab ""#thatPOWER.""

The 31-year-old singer surprise-released a new album, “Swag,” Friday after teasing fans the previous morning with a series of billboards and social media posts. Bieber's first album since 2021's “Justice,” the new music prompted an online frenzy and revived a devoted community of Beliebers. From his marriage to his paparazzi encounters, Bieber has faced incredible scrutiny over the last few months, which he addresses head-on in “Swag.” After listening to all 21 tracks, here are our biggest takeaways. R&Bieber is back Bieber has incorporated R&B elements in his music since early in his career and embraced the genre fully on the 2013 compilation album “Journals.” But even after coining R&Bieber in 2019, he's struggled to be taken seriously. When 2020's “Changes” received a Grammy nomination for pop vocal album, Bieber expressed his confusion at not being nominated in the R&B category. “To the Grammys I am flattered to be acknowledged and appreciated for my artistry. I am very meticulous and intentional about my music. With that being said I set out to make an R&B album. ' Changes' was and is an R&B album,” he wrote on Instagram. “It is not being acknowledged as an R&B album which is very strange to me. I grew up admiring R&B music and wished to make a project that would embody that sound.” “To be clear I absolutely love Pop music,” he added. “It just wasn't what I set out to make this time around. My gratitude for feeling respected for my work remains and I am honored to be nominated either way.” On “Swag,” Bieber shows off his R&B chops. From opening track “All I Can Take” and the seemingly SZA-inspired “Yukon” to “Daisies” (which reportedly features Mk.gee on the guitar), he takes a more intimate approach than on previous albums. But still, longtime fans will hear hints of “Journals” and “Changes” throughout the project. In one of the album's unconventional moments, comedian Druski comments on Bieber's more “soulful,” R&B-infused sound. “I said this album kinda sound, you got some soul on this album too, bro,” he says on the interlude track “Soulful.” “Your skin white but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you, man.” He's not 'Walking Away' from his marriage Since Justin and Hailey Bieber wed in 2018, their marriage has been under a microscope. Divorce rumors circulated within months of them tying the knot, and it didn't help that many fans were still rooting for the singer to get back with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. Bieber's love for his wife is evident throughout his catalog — from 2020's “All Around Me” to 2021's “Hailey.” But in case anyone is still skeptical (they are), Bieber sets the record straight on “Swag.” On album standout “Walking Away,” Bieber gets candid about his relationship troubles but also reaffirms that he's committed to his marriage. “You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,” he sings. Elsewhere on the album, he cheers on his wife. On “Go Baby” (which lyrically echoes 2021's “There She Go”), he sings, “That's my baby, she's iconic, iPhone case, lip gloss on it” — a reference to the Rhode founder's famous lip gloss-holder phone case.

mov_CBF88DB5433CA59566B26443100647CD,"  Justin Bieber has reportedly settled with Scooter Braun, his former manager, for $31.5 million over their financial dispute regarding the pop star's canceled ""Justice Tour"" and alleged unpaid commissions. This news came amid the release of the pop singer's seventh studio album, , on July 11, 2025. On July 10, 2025, TMZ reported that Bieber and Braun reached a $31.5 million settlement regarding their financial dispute. News of Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun reportedly settling their financial dispute was met with mixed reactions from netizens on X, with one user accusing the former manager of robbing Bieber. ""So scooter robbed justin, disgusting, karma is coming."" liv @grandesnasaso scooter robbed justin, disgusting, karma is coming Several netizens agreed with this sentiment, claiming Braun was a ""fake friend"" to Bieber. ""That person should change their name to scooter robber,"" one person tweeted. ""All my homies hate scooter braun,"" another person added. ""That's when you know there are no friends in the music business…Braun always acted like he was Justin's friend and cared for him…but once it affected his pockets all that fake friendship went out the window… and we all saw the medical issues that made Justin cancel the tour,"" someone else commented. ""Scooter deserves no more money after this,"" another user said. Others speculated whether the pop star's wife, Hailey Bieber, was instrumental in settling the debt. For context, Hailey sold her beauty brand, Rhode, to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion in late May 2025. ""Hailey helped him pay the debt by selling her company,"" one person speculated. ""I bet that was Hailey's Rhode money,"" another person added. ""That rhode money is gonna last nothing at this point,"" someone else commented. ""Hence the lovely posts with wifey! Women always save the day smh,"" another user wrote. Exploring Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun's financial dispute The financial dispute between Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun began in 2022, while the singer was on his ""Justice Tour"" to promote his sixth studio album. For the uninitiated, Bieber reportedly received a $40 million advance from Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), which is Live Nation's parent company, for his ""Justice Tour"" in 2022. However, the singer canceled most of the tour in 2023 due to a health condition (he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome) and was asked to pay back $26 million of the advance to AEG. According to TMZ, Scooter Braun, who was Bieber's manager at the time, shouldered the payment through his company Hybe, with the pop star promising to pay Hybe and Braun back in installments over the next 10 years. Justin Bieber reportedly paid just one installment and stopped. However, recent reports indicate that Bieber and Braun have settled the payment, which also included an additional clause requiring Bieber to pay half of the $11 million that he allegedly owed Braun in unpaid commissions, bringing the total to $31.5 million. As per the TMZ report, this does not include the additional $8.6 million that Bieber allegedly owed Braun in further unpaid commissions, which the former manager waived. There have been multiple reports of Justin Bieber's alleged financial struggles, which many believe contributed to the singer selling his 291-song catalogue to Hipgnosis Songs Capital in December 2022 for $200 million. A TMZ documentary released in May 2025, titled alleged that the singer “had to sell his music catalog because he was broke.” “I was on a call with multiple people — Justin's side acknowledges that in 2022, he was on the verge of… the words were 'financial collapse.' And that's why he had to sell his catalog,” TMZ executive producer Levin says in the documentary. However, Justin Bieber has denied all rumors of his alleged financial troubles, with his representative telling The Hollywood Reporter in April 2025: “Any source that is trying to sell you a story about alleged financial distress … either doesn't understand the entertainment industry or, more likely, is trying to paint an unflattering portrait of Justin, which bears no resemblance to reality.” As per Celebrity Net Worth, Justin Bieber's net worth is reportedly $200 million as of July 2025. In other news, Justin Bieber surprised fans after he released his new album, , on July 11 with minimal promotion. The 21-track album reportedly features artists like Cash Cobain, Gunna, and Druski.

On July 10, 2025, TMZ reported that Bieber and Braun reached a $31.5 million settlement regarding their financial dispute. News of Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun reportedly settling their financial dispute was met with mixed reactions from netizens on X, with one user accusing the former manager of robbing Bieber. ""So scooter robbed justin, disgusting, karma is coming."" liv scooter robbed justin, disgusting, karma is coming Several netizens agreed with this sentiment, claiming Braun was a ""fake friend"" to Bieber. ""That person should change their name to scooter robber,"" one person tweeted. ""All my homies hate scooter braun,"" another person added. ""That's when you know there are no friends in the music business…Braun always acted like he was Justin's friend and cared for him…but once it affected his pockets all that fake friendship went out the window… and we all saw the medical issues that made Justin cancel the tour,"" someone else commented. ""Scooter deserves no more money after this,"" another user said. Others speculated whether the pop star's wife, Hailey Bieber, was instrumental in settling the debt. For context, Hailey sold her beauty brand, Rhode, to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion in late May 2025. ""Hailey helped him pay the debt by selling her company,"" one person speculated. ""I bet that was Hailey's Rhode money,"" another person added. ""That rhode money is gonna last nothing at this point,"" someone else commented. ""Hence the lovely posts with wifey! Women always save the day smh,"" another user wrote. Exploring Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun's financial dispute The financial dispute between Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun began in 2022, while the singer was on his ""Justice Tour"" to promote his sixth studio album. For the uninitiated, Bieber reportedly received a $40 million advance from Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), which is Live Nation's parent company, for his ""Justice Tour"" in 2022. However, the singer canceled most of the tour in 2023 due to a health condition (he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome) and was asked to pay back $26 million of the advance to AEG. According to TMZ, Scooter Braun, who was Bieber's manager at the time, shouldered the payment through his company Hybe, with the pop star promising to pay Hybe and Braun back in installments over the next 10 years. Justin Bieber reportedly paid just one installment and stopped. However, recent reports indicate that Bieber and Braun have settled the payment, which also included an additional clause requiring Bieber to pay half of the $11 million that he allegedly owed Braun in unpaid commissions, bringing the total to $31.5 million. As per the TMZ report, this does not include the additional $8.6 million that Bieber allegedly owed Braun in further unpaid commissions, which the former manager waived. There have been multiple reports of Justin Bieber's alleged financial struggles, which many believe contributed to the singer selling his 291-song catalogue to Hipgnosis Songs Capital in December 2022 for $200 million. A TMZ documentary released in May 2025, titled alleged that the singer “had to sell his music catalog because he was broke.” “I was on a call with multiple people — Justin's side acknowledges that in 2022, he was on the verge of… the words were 'financial collapse.' And that's why he had to sell his catalog,” TMZ executive producer Levin says in the documentary. However, Justin Bieber has denied all rumors of his alleged financial troubles, with his representative telling The Hollywood Reporter in April 2025: “Any source that is trying to sell you a story about alleged financial distress … either doesn't understand the entertainment industry or, more likely, is trying to paint an unflattering portrait of Justin, which bears no resemblance to reality.” As per Celebrity Net Worth, Justin Bieber's net worth is reportedly $200 million as of July 2025. In other news, Justin Bieber surprised fans after he released his new album, , on July 11 with minimal promotion. The 21-track album reportedly features artists like Cash Cobain, Gunna, and Druski.
