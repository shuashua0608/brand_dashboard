mov_9E1AD7F987F471B55266647D9F94B21D,"  Day one of Amazon's four-day Prime Week event is live. Scouted selects products independently. If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission. Grab your wallets—it's officially that time of year again. Amazon's annual Prime Day extravaganza is back, and this time, the so-called 'Black Friday in July' is bigger (and longer) than ever before. For 2025, the epic shopping event runs four days—double the usual two—kicking off Tuesday, July 8, and wrapping up Friday, July 11, at 11 p.m. PT. This means shoppers get 96 hours to snag the best deals across Amazon's virtual aisles. Prime members can expect thousands of markdowns on everything from big-ticket electronics and home upgrades to luxe beauty staples, with major names like LG, Dyson, NuFace, Levi's, Samsung, Peloton, Bissell, and more in the mix. This year also brings a shiny new shopping feature: “Today's Big Deals”—a daily, themed drop of limited-time offers from top brands like Samsung, Kiehl's, and Levi's, launching at midnight and available while supplies last. You do need to be an Amazon Prime member to partake in Prime Day 2025, but if you're not already signed up, Amazon offers a free 30-day trial, so you can score the deals without committing right away (otherwise, it's $14.99/month or $139/year). With thousands of discounts to sift through over the next four days, it can feel a little overwhelming to figure out what's actually worth adding to your cart. That's where Scouted comes in: scroll on to check out all of our favorite Prime Day 2025 deals.

Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask This cult favorite leave-on lip mask by Laneige is a favorite among Forbes Vetted editors for delivering deep hydration and antioxidants as you sleep. “I keep the Laneige mask on my nightstand and slather it on before bed,” says special projects editor Jennifer Ferrise. ""I'm always amazed at how much softer my lips are every morning thanks to the mask's moisturizing ingredients like shea butter and murumuru seed. Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've seen for this lip sleeping mask all year. Limited Edition Dyson Airwrap i.d. Multi-Styler And Dryer Straight+Wavy After testing multiple hair tools for several months, features and special projects director Kim Peiffer named the Dyson Airwrap the best luxury blow dryer brush. “I've had this multi-styling tool for over a year now, and have seen firsthand all that it does—from smoothing strands to adding volume to creating perfect curls that mimic a professional in-salon blowout,” says Peiffer. During Prime Day, you can score the limited edition model in the color Jasper Plum for $100 less than the typical retail price. Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've seen for this model of the Dyson Airwrap all year. Solawave 4-In-1 Red Light Therapy Facial Wand This portable red light therapy wand targets fine lines and wrinkles, and helps with skin elasticity and firmness. With just three-minute daily sessions per area, regular users should notice improvements after several weeks. “I've had the Solawave Wand for over a year,” says special projects editor Jennifer Ferrise. “When I use it consistently, I notice that my skin tone is more even and the texture is smoother. It also helps reduce facial puffiness after a late night.” Why It's A Good Deal: This is the second-lowest price we've seen for the Solawave wand this year. Living Proof Perfect Hair Day Dry Shampoo Several members of the Forbes Vetted team have tried and loved this formula from Living Proof—so much so, it earned the title of best dry shampoo as a part of the 2024 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards. “This is the holy grail of dry shampoos,” says one tester, who has used it regularly for years. “It's consistently lightweight and volumizing, without leaving behind a chalky feel.” Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've seen for this dry shampoo all year. Nood Flasher 2.0 Kit Just in time for swimsuit season, the Nood Flasher 2.0 makes at-home laser hair removal easy. It's our top pick for coarse hair on our list of the best laser hair removal devices. “The Flasher 2.0 has a thoughtful, compact design that fits nicely in the hand, and it's lightweight enough that lengthier IPL sessions don't feel like a chore,” says one of our testers. Get it bundled with an exfoliating cleanser and soothing aloe treatment for 24% off. Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've ever seen for this laser hair removal device on Amazon.
