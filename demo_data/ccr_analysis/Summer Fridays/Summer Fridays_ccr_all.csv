This is especially lovely for sensitive skin, since the plant milk base is nutrient-rich and sulfate-free to keep your skin feeling eeextra soft and loved.

mov_26C84E74E702E43ACBCAC201E2934086,"  Shop these editor-loved deals before the clock runs out NEED TO KNOW PEOPLE Picks is a recurring roundup of products the people behind PEOPLE Shopping actually buy. My coworkers and I on the PEOPLE shopping team collectively spend hundreds of hours a week scouring the internet for celebrity-worn fashion and deals we'd be remiss not to share with the world. But what are we adding to our own carts, you ask? This Amazon Prime Day, I tapped writers, editors, and directors to reveal not just the best deals this year, but also what they're most excited to personally get their hands on — especially while they're up to 50 percent off. We're grabbing Away luggage (hello, OOO!) , the Dyson Airwrap, Summer Fridays lip balm, a Kindle, and so many more Amazon finds. Shop like a pro and add them to your cart while prices start at just $13. Amazon Prime Day PEOPLE Picks Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, $17 with Prime Amazon “I've been using Laneige's ever-popular lip mask every day for more than five years, and I always restock my stash during Prime Day. It has an ultra-rich formula that instantly hydrates my lips and provides long-lasting nourishment. I use it each night before bed, but it works great as a lip balm throughout the day, too.” —Clara McMahon, senior Amazon news and deals writer Away Bigger Carry-On, $236 with Prime Amazon “I've had the same suitcase for more years than I care to admit, so I'm finally treating myself to this sleek Away carry-on while it's marked down.” —Lindsey Greenfeld, senior shopping editor Caraway Petite Cooker, $99 with Prime People “I don't need to cook a large amount of food at one time, and this tiny Caraway pot has been a game changer in my kitchen. I can quickly boil eggs or make rice because I don't have to sit and wait for a massive pot of water to come to a boil. Plus, it's really cute, so I can leave it sitting out on the stove and admire it even when I'm not cooking.” —Erin Johnson, editorial director of content marketing Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler Nordstrom “The Dyson AirWrap is the Aston Martin of all hair tools, and it certainly has a price to show for it. But since I've been thinking about it for over two years now, it's long out of the 'impulse purchase' category and is something I genuinely think I'd use over and over again, probably every day, even — that's how often I wash my hair!” —Alyssa Grabinski, senior shopping writer Elescat Boho Vintage Sundress, $14 with Prime Amazon “I absolutely roast on the New York subway, so this summer, I'm on the hunt for breezy, lightweight dresses that I can throw on for the office, brunch, and everything in between. I think this simple dress is so cute with over 30 patterns and colors to choose from. Its A-line silhouette looks good on everyone, and the breathable cotton will be ideal as temperatures continue to rise.” —Madison Yauger, shopping editor Camkory Digital Camera, $40 with Prime Amazon “I bought this digital camera during Black Friday, as I wanted to try one out that was similar to the cameras I had when I was a teenager. It's been a fun little addition to my camera collection, especially when traveling and at parties and weddings I've brought it to. My 10-year-old nephew has become a fan of it, and it's super easy to use. Now he'll have his own camera to practice taking photos with instead of asking to use mine!” —Jennifer Maldonado, associate editorial director Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray, $20 with Prime Amazon “This frizz-fighting blow dry spray is an essential part of my summer haircare lineup, so I'm stocking up while it's on sale to keep my hair looking sleek and shiny all season long — even in the worst humidity.” —Maggie Horton, shopping writer Summer Fridays Tinted Lip Butter Balm People...","Shop these editor-loved deals before the clock runs out NEED TO KNOW PEOPLE Picks is a recurring roundup of products the people behind PEOPLE Shopping actually buy.
