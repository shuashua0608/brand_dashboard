  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "CRITICAL",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high sentiment risk (100/100) with 15% organic negative sentiment",
      "Significant counterfeit/CCR risk (87.92/100) with multiple high-risk fake product reports",
      "High promotional content risk (67.29/100) with 48.4% content repetition rate",
      "Multiple risk indicators across categories creating compounding effect",
      "Presence of spam content (2.08%) alongside legitimate promotional activity"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The critical risk assessment is primarily driven by the perfect storm of extremely negative sentiment (100/100) combined with substantial counterfeit concerns (87.92/100). The 15% organic negative sentiment rate indicates genuine customer dissatisfaction that isn't being diluted by promotional content. When paired with verified reports of fake products and suspicious sources, this creates an urgent brand integrity crisis. The high content repetition rate (48.4%) suggests the conversation around Rhode is becoming monotonous and potentially manipulated, rather than diverse and authentic.\n\nWhat makes this situation particularly concerning is how these factors interact and amplify each other. The presence of counterfeit products likely contributes to negative sentiment as consumers receive inferior products believing they're authentic Rhode items. Meanwhile, the high promotional content (37.5% promotional rate) is failing to counterbalance negative sentiment, suggesting the brand's marketing efforts aren't effectively addressing core customer concerns. The spam content (2.08%) further undermines brand credibility in an already vulnerable environment.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Initiate counterfeit investigation focusing on reported Amazon listings and suspicious sources within 24 hours",
      "2. Deploy social listening team to engage directly with negative sentiment posts, especially those mentioning product quality or authenticity",
      "3. Temporarily pause influencer campaigns to assess effectiveness and messaging alignment",
      "4. Issue brand statement acknowledging counterfeit concerns with verification guidelines for authentic products",
      "5. Implement emergency sentiment monitoring with 12-hour reporting cycles",
      "6. Contact Amazon brand registry team to address fake product concerns on the platform"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop comprehensive anti-counterfeit strategy including product authentication features and consumer education\n2. Restructure promotional content approach to reduce repetition and increase authentic engagement\n3. Create dedicated customer service channel for authenticity verification and concerns\n4. Conduct sentiment analysis deep-dive to identify specific product issues driving negative feedback\n5. Implement influencer guidelines that prioritize authentic reviews over scripted promotion\n6. Develop crisis management playbook specific to counterfeit situations\n7. Consider product sampling program to rebuild trust with skeptical consumers",
    "business_impact": "If unaddressed, these risks could lead to significant revenue decline as consumers lose trust in product authenticity. The high-end skincare market is particularly sensitive to quality concerns, and Rhode could face lasting reputation damage affecting Hailey Bieber's personal brand equity. Customer acquisition costs will likely increase as marketing effectiveness decreases amid skepticism. The combination of counterfeits and negative sentiment could trigger a downward spiral where legitimate customers abandon the brand, leaving a higher concentration of counterfeit products in the marketplace, further damaging brand perception.",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Counterfeit reporting rate: Set alert threshold at >1 new report per day\n2. Organic negative sentiment: Monitor daily with escalation at >10% sustained for 3+ days\n3. Amazon-specific mentions: Track separately with immediate alerts for authenticity concerns\n4. Engagement rate on brand responses to negative comments: Target >25% positive resolution\n5. Promotional content effectiveness: Track sentiment shift pre/post campaign\n6. Share of voice between authentic vs. suspicious product discussions\n7. Conversion tracking from social traffic to ensure sales aren't being diverted to counterfeit channels"
