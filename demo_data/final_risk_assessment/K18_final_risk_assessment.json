    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high promotional content rate (46.2%) with significant affiliate marketing presence",
      "Notable content repetition rate (20.5%) suggesting coordinated promotional activity",
      "Mixed sentiment present in 12.8% of content, indicating potential customer satisfaction issues",
      "Low organic engagement relative to promotional content volume",
      "Presence of medium risk counterfeit/CCR activity despite low overall CCR score"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The K18 brand is experiencing a high-risk situation primarily driven by an imbalance between promotional and organic content. With nearly half (46.2%) of all content being promotional in nature and dominated by affiliate marketing, the brand appears to be heavily reliant on paid partnerships rather than organic advocacy. This is compounded by the 20.5% content repetition rate, suggesting coordinated promotional campaigns that may appear inauthentic to consumers. While the overall comment volume is relatively low (39 comments over 13 days), the quality and authenticity of these interactions raise significant concerns.\n\nThe presence of mixed sentiment (12.8%) alongside negative emotions (7.7%) indicates underlying customer satisfaction issues that require attention. Although there is minimal direct negative sentiment, the combination of high promotional content and mixed sentiment suggests the brand may be masking potential product concerns through aggressive marketing. The medium risk counterfeit/CCR activity, while isolated, could indicate emerging unauthorized sales channels that could damage brand reputation and customer trust if left unaddressed.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Conduct audit of all affiliate marketing partners to identify those creating repetitive content and establish quality guidelines",
      "2. Investigate the medium risk counterfeit incident to determine source and potential distribution channels",
      "3. Analyze mixed sentiment comments to identify specific product concerns or customer service issues",
      "4. Temporarily reduce affiliate marketing activity by 25% while increasing organic content initiatives",
      "5. Implement sentiment monitoring alerts for real-time notification of negative comment clusters"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a balanced content strategy with healthier ratio of organic to promotional content (target: 70% organic, 30% promotional)\n2. Create an affiliate/influencer quality program with clear guidelines on authentic content creation and reduced repetition\n3. Implement a counterfeit monitoring and enforcement program, particularly on Amazon and other e-commerce platforms\n4. Establish a customer feedback loop to address product concerns identified in mixed sentiment comments\n5. Develop brand advocacy program to encourage genuine user-generated content from satisfied customers\n6. Create crisis management protocols for potential counterfeit or product quality issues",
    "business_impact": "If these risks are not addressed, K18 could face declining consumer trust due to perceived inauthenticity in marketing. The heavy reliance on promotional content may lead to reduced organic growth and customer loyalty, ultimately affecting sales conversion rates. The presence of counterfeits, even at low levels, could damage brand reputation and lead to negative customer experiences. The mixed sentiment indicates potential product satisfaction issues that could escalate into more widespread negative sentiment if left unaddressed. Long-term, these factors could erode K18's premium positioning in the professional haircare market and diminish the perceived value of their patented molecular repair technology.",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Promotional content ratio: Alert if exceeds 40%, critical if exceeds 50%\n2. Content repetition rate: Alert if exceeds 15%, critical if exceeds 25%\n3. Negative sentiment: Alert if exceeds 5%, critical if exceeds 10%\n4. Mixed sentiment: Alert if exceeds 15%, critical if exceeds 20%\n5. Counterfeit incidents: Immediate alert for any new incidents regardless of risk level\n6. Organic engagement rate: Alert if falls below 3% of audience, critical if below 1%\n7. Daily comment volume changes: Alert if decreases by 30% or increases by 50% week-over-week"
