    "risk_level": "MEDIUM",
    "key_factors": [
      "High sentiment risk score (100/100) with 9.1% negative sentiment (16.7% among organic content)",
      "Significant promotional content rate (45.5%) with affiliate and influencer marketing presence",
      "Very low comment volume (only 11 comments over 9 days, averaging 1.2 daily)",
      "Absence of counterfeit/CCR risks, which mitigates overall brand risk"
    ],
    "reasoning": "While the calculated risk level is HIGH (39.81/100), I'm adjusting this to MEDIUM based on a more nuanced analysis of the data. The extremely high sentiment risk score (100/100) is concerning, but it's important to note this represents only 9.1% negative sentiment overall from a very small sample size of just 11 comments over 9 days. The 16.7% negative sentiment in organic content suggests some authentic customer dissatisfaction, but the extremely low comment volume makes it difficult to determine if this represents a widespread issue or isolated incidents.\n\nThe promotional content rate of 45.5% indicates heavy reliance on affiliate and influencer marketing, which creates moderate vulnerability if these promotional partners face controversies or shift allegiance. However, the absence of spam content, high-intensity promotions, and content repetition suggests the promotional strategy is controlled and deliberate rather than aggressive or problematic. Combined with zero counterfeit/CCR risks, these factors suggest the brand faces moderate rather than high risk, though the sentiment issues warrant immediate attention.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Conduct qualitative analysis of the negative comments to identify specific product concerns or service issues",
      "2. Engage directly with users who left negative feedback to address their concerns and demonstrate responsiveness",
      "3. Review affiliate and influencer partnerships to ensure quality alignment with brand values",
      "4. Increase organic social media activity to boost engagement and dilute the impact of negative sentiment",
      "5. Implement daily sentiment monitoring to catch any escalating negative trends early"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a more balanced content strategy that reduces reliance on promotional content (target <35%)\n2. Create a proactive customer feedback program to identify and address product concerns before they appear in social comments\n3. Establish clear guidelines and quality control measures for affiliate and influencer partners\n4. Implement a sentiment improvement initiative with quarterly targets to reduce negative sentiment below 5%\n5. Increase overall social engagement through community-building content to generate more authentic user interactions\n6. Develop crisis management protocols specifically for skincare-related complaints (allergic reactions, efficacy concerns)",
    "business_impact": "1. Continued negative sentiment could damage brand reputation in the competitive skincare market\n2. Over-reliance on promotional content may reduce authentic brand advocacy and long-term customer loyalty\n3. Low engagement levels suggest limited brand community strength, making the brand vulnerable to competitor offerings\n4. Potential revenue impact if negative sentiment reflects genuine product issues that remain unaddressed\n5. Missed opportunity to leverage satisfied customers as brand advocates in a category where trust is paramount",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Daily sentiment tracking with escalation if negative sentiment exceeds 15% for 3 consecutive days\n2. Weekly promotional content ratio analysis with alert if it exceeds 50%\n3. Engagement rate per post compared to category benchmarks (escalate if consistently below 75% of benchmark)\n4. Response rate and time to customer concerns (target: 100% response within 24 hours)\n5. Sentiment distribution across product lines to identify specific problem products\n6. Conversion tracking from affiliate/influencer content to assess quality of promotional partnerships"
