  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "CRITICAL",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high comment intensity (100/100) with high content repetition rate (93.8%)",
      "Significant counterfeit risk (88.56/100) with multiple high-risk indicators",
      "Elevated negative sentiment among organic users (8.2%)",
      "Promotional content dominance (53.4% of all content)",
      "Poor clustering efficiency (28.3%) indicating disorganized conversation patterns"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The critical risk assessment is justified by the convergence of multiple high-severity factors. The extremely high comment intensity score (100/100) combined with a 93.8% content repetition rate suggests coordinated activity that could indicate either a brand crisis or manipulation of the conversation. This is particularly concerning when paired with the counterfeit risk score of 88.56, which includes multiple high-risk indicators of fake products and suspicious sources.\n\nThe promotional content analysis reveals that over half (53.4%) of all content is promotional in nature, with a concerning pattern of repetition. While official brand content leads (107 instances), the high volume of affiliate (68) and influencer (47) promotions creates an environment where authentic consumer voices are being drowned out. This explains the disparity between overall negative sentiment (3.8%) and organic negative sentiment (8.2%), suggesting actual consumer dissatisfaction is being masked by promotional content. The poor clustering efficiency (28.3%) further indicates fragmented conversations that are difficult to monitor effectively.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Initiate counterfeit investigation focusing on the 4 high-risk instances and 10 suspicious source reports",
      "2. Implement 24-hour monitoring of comment sections with automated alerts for negative sentiment spikes",
      "3. Contact major affiliates and influencers to pause promotional campaigns until situation assessment is complete",
      "4. Prepare crisis communication templates addressing potential counterfeit concerns",
      "5. Conduct rapid sentiment analysis on organic comments to identify specific product or quality issues",
      "6. Engage legal team to address the most egregious counterfeit sellers identified"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a verified retailer program with authentication measures consumers can verify\n2. Implement promotional content guidelines for affiliates and influencers with clear disclosure requirements\n3. Create a dedicated consumer feedback channel separate from promotional content\n4. Establish regular counterfeit monitoring sweeps across all major platforms and marketplaces\n5. Develop an early warning system based on sentiment analysis of organic comments\n6. Restructure social media content strategy to improve authentic engagement and reduce repetition\n7. Partner with platforms to implement verified seller badges for authorized Dior fragrance retailers",
    "business_impact": "If unaddressed, these risks could lead to significant brand damage and financial consequences. Counterfeit products may cause health and safety issues for consumers, leading to potential litigation and regulatory scrutiny. The high promotional content ratio is masking actual consumer sentiment, creating a false sense of brand health while authentic negative feedback grows. Revenue loss from counterfeit sales could reach 5-10% of category revenue. Most critically, Dior's luxury positioning and premium pricing strategy could be undermined if consumers lose trust in product authenticity, potentially causing long-term damage to brand equity and price positioning power.",
