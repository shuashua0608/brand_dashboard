EAF08F5EC939AAFE9B96F88DE3FB95CB,"  MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage (I charge from £1,150 for mine). Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 (£19.55, www.amazon.co.uk), Olaplex No.8 (£22.40, www.sephora.co.uk) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer (£21, www.boots.com). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner (£27, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner (£26, www.harrods.com). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now £17.99, sha op.toni www.ndguy.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now £12, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo (£24.50, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment (£25). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

Whether your hair is naturally dry or parched from excessive color treatments and heat styling, brittle strands are a stubborn bummer. And as you know by now, dryness doesn't discriminate—even oily scalps can lead to straw-like strands. Cherin Choi, a bicoastal hairstylist, emphasizes the importance of selecting a formula with ingredients that cater to the specific needs of dry hair, setting you up for long-term success. “Opt for shampoos containing nourishing oils, aloe vera, or hyaluronic acid to hydrate without weighing hair down,” she advises. That's why we combed through the backs of beloved bottles, checked in with experts to learn why they work, and made sure our editors gave them a good suds to see what the hype is all about. Our top pick was the HairStory New Wash, a lather-less shampoo (yes, that's right) that offers a milky cleanse hydrating enough to skip the conditioner if you please.

Finally, the ones that made this list kept our hair velvety smooth, flyaway and static free. Post two to three washes, our strands were soft, smooth and moisturized for days.

Too much foam can actually dry out your hair, which is why this formula transforms into a milky wash instead—cleansing, conditioning, supporting scalp health, and enhancing texture, all without harsh detergents. It's a favorite of Choi for good reason: it works on all hair types, plays nice with color-treated strands, and can even replace your conditioner if you're a one-and-done kind of washer.

mov_6C64DD084F0504F6AD6C1CDB13175417,"  The age-old question when it comes to haircare is: why isn't my hair doing what I want? Getting your locks to look their best can often be a struggle, especially if you have textured, coloured or damaged hair, as so many of us do. Often, it's the products we think are helping our hair that are actually harming it, so, it's time to reach for the best sulphate-free shampoos. Sulphates are the chemicals and ingredients added to shampoos that give you that clean-hair feeling. They remove dirt, grease and other impurities, and create that bubbly lather we all know and love. However, they can also strip hair of its natural oil and moisture, leaving it more brittle, lifeless and likely to shed or snap. So, what do we do? Well, the good news is sulphate-free shampoos are gradually becoming the norm, providing nourishing alternatives that can cleanse your hair and scalp without being too harsh. I spoke to Emma Vickery, art director at Percy and Reed, who's spent most of her career obsessing over how we should look after our hair. “Products are far more gentle and kind to the hair and skin without sulphates – any other good ingredients in the formulations are now no longer compromised by being intermixed with them,” says Vickery. As for finding the right product for your particular locks, I've put a whole range of formulas through their paces. No matter what you're looking for – from frizz-fighting to colour protection – you're sure to find the best sulphate-free shampoo for you in this round-up. How I tested the best sulphate-free shampoos Trying out a wide range of sulphate-free shampoos – from luxury salon-style buys to budget-friendly brands – I have never looked at my hair so closely before, making sure to take note of even the slightest changes. This started by making sure I kept the rest of my haircare routine the same, so any changes could be attributed to the new shampoo. When testing, I considered key factors such as: Ease of use: I looked at how effortlessly each product lathered (despite the absence of sulphates), how simple it was to rinse out, and whether the packaging was practical and user-friendly. Shampoos that required excessive effort to distribute evenly or left behind residue were marked down, while those that provided a smooth, intuitive washing experience stood out. Scent: While personal preference varies, I prioritised shampoos with pleasant fragrances that didn't overpower or linger too long after rinsing. Since sulphate-free formulas often rely on more natural ingredients, I also noted whether the scent felt clean and fresh or overly artificial. Results: The final look and feel of the hair were central to testing. I assessed how each product left the hair after washing – looking for softness, shine, manageability, and overall health. Shampoos that made hair feel clean but not stripped, smooth but not weighed down, ranked highest. I also noted improvements in frizz control, curl definition, or volume where relevant.

I was also blown away by the capabilities and natural ingredients of Sukin's natural balance shampoo, especially as the size is so generous for the price. What are sulphates? Essentially, sulphates are chemicals used as a cleaning agent in products such as shampoo, shaving gel and shower wash. It's what causes the foam when washing your hair, which, for most people, tells them it's doing its job of removing dirt. But, for certain types of hair – such as curly hair – using sulphates can be damaging, and it can even cause skin irritation for some. What does a sulphate-free shampoo actually do? This type of shampoo works much like any other regular formula but the ingredient list is where you'll find the most differences, due to the lack of sulphates. While they might sound harmless, sulphate ingredients can cause the scalp's natural oils, which help to keep strands healthy, to be stripped away, and they can even cause some skin irritation. Is sulphate-free shampoo good for hair? Some people prefer their shampoo to be foamy, in which case sulphate-free shampoo might not be for you. However, there are a lot of benefits to be had from staying clear of this chemical, such as reducing frizz and scalp irritation, as well as leaving hair softer and better conditioned, while it can also help curly hair stay intact....","The age-old question when it comes to haircare is: why isn't my hair doing what I want?

This type of shampoo works much like any other regular formula but the ingredient list is where you'll find the most differences, due to the lack of sulphates. While they might sound harmless, sulphate ingredients can cause the scalp's natural oils, which help to keep strands healthy, to be stripped away, and they can even cause some skin irritation. Is sulphate-free shampoo good for hair? Some people prefer their shampoo to be foamy, in which case sulphate-free shampoo might not be for you. However, there are a lot of benefits to be had from staying clear of this chemical, such as reducing frizz and scalp irritation, as well as leaving hair softer and better conditioned, while it can also help curly hair stay intact....",2025-07-15 10:26:16,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The content specifically mentions Olaplex No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo as one of the best sulphate-free shampoos for damaged hair, providing a positive review and context within the haircare category.

Y lo hace con fuerza. El Amla en Polvo Orgánico, usado durante siglos en la medicina ayurvédica, ha regresado con el poder de una tendencia pero con la solidez de una tradición. Este polvo vegetal, derivado del fruto indio Phyllanthus emblica, está conquistando rituales de cuidado natural por su capacidad real de transformar tanto el cabello como la piel. Y ahora está por solo 14 euros en Amazon durante Prime Day, sin marketing excesivo, sin fórmulas vacías. Solo naturaleza en su forma más pura. La versatilidad del Amla es parte de su atractivo. Como mascarilla capilar, fortalece la raíz, frena la caída, estimula el crecimiento y da ese efecto de volumen sano que no depende de siliconas ni ceras sintéticas. Es ideal para cabellos debilitados, teñidos o simplemente cansados de procesos químicos. En una época donde muchas fórmulas capilares prometen pero no cumplen, el Amla actúa con constancia, no con promesas mágicas. Basta con mezclarlo con agua tibia hasta formar una pasta y aplicarlo en cuero cabelludo y largos. El resultado no es inmediato como con un sérum con siliconas, pero sí profundo. El cabello se siente más fuerte, más denso y con una textura que recuerda al pelo virgen: grueso, brillante y con vida propia. El blush rosad de 3 euros que deja efecto Rare Beauty perfecto y sin gastar de más     El fijador de maquillaje viral de Amazon que revive delineadores y ahorra maquillaje     Rizos sin frizz, sin rigidez y con brillo: sí, existe, se llama Olaplex en Amazon ¿Y en la piel? También hay magia. Aplicado como mascarilla facial (mezclado con yogur natural o miel), el Amla ilumina, desinflama y ayuda a igualar el tono. Su alta concentración de vitamina C, antioxidantes y taninos ayuda a reducir manchas, cerrar poros y aportar esa luminosidad natural que no se logra con iluminadores. No pica, no arde, no irrita, y es perfecto para pieles mixtas o grasas que necesitan limpieza profunda sin agresión. Otro punto a favor es su pureza: sin conservantes, sin perfumes, sin ingredientes extraños. Este es uno de esos productos que entiendes con solo leer el empaque. Viene en formato de 200 gramos, lo que alcanza para múltiples aplicaciones tanto capilares como faciales. ¿Por qué importa tanto el regreso de ingredientes como el Amla? Porque, en medio de una industria obsesionada con lo nuevo, lo ancestral regresa con la fuerza de lo que ha sido probado durante siglos. Porque hay algo profundamente honesto en usar un fruto molido como mascarilla. Porque no todo necesita oler a mango artificial ni prometer “piel de filtro” para ser efectivo. El Amla en Polvo Orgánico no es tendencia, es permanencia. Su valor no está solo en sus propiedades, sino en cómo nos conecta con una belleza más consciente, más lenta y más real. Por 14 euros en Amazon por Prime Day, es una inversión natural y poderosa en ti.

397059B84031EE2F45D751CA8833E1A2,"  by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage. Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 ((EURO)29.50, www.brownthomas.com), Olaplex No.8 ((EURO)29.50, www.arnotts.ie) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer ((EURO)24.45, www.lookfantastic.ie). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner ((EURO)31, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner ((EURO)30, www.boots.ie). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now (EURO)22.49, www.cloud10beauty.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now (EURO)14, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo ((EURO)28.20, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment ((EURO)28). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

Promising reviews: ""I first saw this lotion on TikTok; an influencer was bragging about it! Let me tell you, she did not lie. This lotion is the BEST. It smells fantastic. A cross between cotton candy and vanilla, it's just so fresh. It makes my skin smooth all day. This large bottle will last me a couple of months. Thank you, Eos, for such a fantastic lotion.  "" —Erin ""Very similar to my Burberry fragrance, and they layer beautifully. I always get tons of compliments on the scent. I also purchase the jasmine and berry  for a more fruity option but to me it just smells like regular lotion. Cost per use is well worth it considering how thick the lotion is. It also actually moisturizes while leaving a fragrance behind instead of drying my skin out due to the perfume. I have sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions."" —Violet Frahm Get it from Amazon for $9.97 (available in various scents and packs). 2.

Some afforable Eos Shea Butter Vanilla Cashmere body lotion that TikTokers are tripping over themselves to get as they swear it moisturizes and smells as good as much more expensive options from brands like Philosophy and Bath & Body Works. Promising reviews: ""I first saw this lotion on TikTok; an influencer was bragging about it! Let me tell you, she did not lie. This lotion is the BEST. It smells fantastic. A cross between cotton candy and vanilla, it's just so fresh. It makes my skin smooth all day. This large bottle will last me a couple of months. Thank you, Eos, for such a fantastic lotion. "" —Erin ""Very similar to my Burberry fragrance, and they layer beautifully. I always get tons of compliments on the scent. I also purchase the jasmine and berry for a more fruity option but to me it just smells like regular lotion. Cost per use is well worth it considering how thick the lotion is. It also actually moisturizes while leaving a fragrance behind instead of drying my skin out due to the perfume. I have sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions."" —Violet Frahm Get it from Amazon for $9.97 (available in various scents and packs). 2. A tube of Essence's Lash Princess Mascara to give you a falsies-level look for less than five bucks. It seems questionable, I know, but for confirmation, you need only look at the 262,000+ 5-star reviews!! Promising review: ""After using Lights, Camera, Lashes by Tarte for the past year, I got tired of breaking the bank over mascara. My sister suggested Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect and I IMMEDIATELY fell in love. It provides dramatic length and great volume. I can honestly say I can't stop looking at my eyelashes in the mirror every single day because of how awesome they look. Also, it is very long-wearing. I go from an eight-hour workday right to the gym and sweat [a lot]. . and this stuff doesn't budge! I love it!!"" —Carrie E Weikert Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (available in black or brown and as a three-pack). 3. A long-sleeve bodysuit in a deliciously soft fabric — known as Smoke Cloud — that reviewers compare to Skims. They say it washes well, too, so you can count on it being high quality despite the deceivingly low price! And BTW, reviewers say the double lining in the torso is supportive, so they don't need to wear a bra. Promising review: ""Are you kidding me? This is the softest, most comfortable body suit I've ever owned. I got so many compliments lol; everyone did think they were Skims lol, but it's definitely worth every penny. I love and will be getting more colors!!! You need it."" —Wendy L. Get it from Amazon for $28.99 (available in women's sizes XS–3X and 13 colors). And check out all the styles available in the Smoke Cloud fabric here. 4. Elizavecca's Collagen Coating Hair Protein Treatment — it works just like a hair mask to repair your locks in five minutes flat.

mov_A548AF7C4B32CD62627F6947B58D8F47,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Profesional, rápido, sin dañar las uñas y con la potencia necesaria para eliminar el esmalte más resistente: este producto es el secreto mejor guardado de las amantes del nail art. Este quitaesmalte en formato gel no es como los clásicos líquidos agresivos que arruinan la cutícula. La fórmula de Jodsone está diseñada para actuar solo sobre el esmalte, evitando resecar o debilitar las uñas naturales. Su textura en gel permite aplicar con precisión sobre cada uña, sin chorreos ni manchas, lo que lo hace ideal incluso para uso en casa sin experiencia previa. No importa si llevas gel semipermanente, esmalte tradicional o acrílico, este removedor lo elimina todo con rapidez. Solo tienes que aplicar, esperar entre 3 y 5 minutos y retirar con un empujador de cutícula o palito de naranjo. Sin complicaciones. Uno de los puntos más valorados por usuarias es que, a diferencia de los productos de acetona pura, Jodsone incluye agentes hidratantes que cuidan la superficie de la uña mientras trabajan. Esto se traduce en una experiencia de limpieza suave, efectiva y sin olores agresivos. Buttermelt NYX professional makeup: brillo ligero por 11 euros en Amazon     El secreto de las melenas perfectas cuesta solo 10 euros en Amazon: Olaplex no. 6     El sérum más viral de Garnier por 7 euros en Amazon: vitamina c y piel perfecta Además, al no tener consistencia líquida, se evita el desperdicio de producto, lo cual lo vuelve mucho más rendidor que otros formatos. Una pequeña cantidad basta para eliminar el esmalte de ambas manos sin esfuerzo. Otro de sus puntos fuertes es su formato compacto y seguro, ideal para llevar en la maleta o bolso de mano. No necesitas algodones ni papel aluminio: con una espátula o brocha puedes aplicarlo directamente y ver cómo el esmalte comienza a romperse casi al instante. Por solo 8 euros, tienes en tus manos un producto de nivel profesional, con resultados inmediatos, una fórmula pensada para el cuidado de las uñas y con cientos de reseñas positivas en Amazon que avalan su efectividad. Si buscas una alternativa fácil, económica y menos agresiva para retirar esmalte —incluyendo los más difíciles—, es, sin duda, tu mejor aliado. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]Profesional, rápido, sin dañar las uñas y con la potencia necesaria para eliminar el esmalte más resistente: este producto es el secreto mejor guardado de las amantes del nail art.

A tinted lip balm that's eerily close to the same magic as ""Black Honey,"" TikTok's beloved $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique, that it will genuinely startle you — especially when you see the price. This is a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lippie that's just a step above the ""no makeup makeup"" look, giving the perfect subtly polished effect. I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference! Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (also available in the pink honey version, and in a two-pack that mixes both!) . 2. Gold Bond's firming neck and chest cream your skin will be SO happy to soak up — this is formulated with aloe, salicylic acid, and jojoba oil to help hydrate, tighten, and gently exfoliate your skin so effectively that you should be able to see early results in two weeks. Reviewers especially love how affordable this is compared to creams that often cost three times this $12 price tag (or more)! Promising review: ""I am a lotion user every single day. I use face moisturizers that I love. I am over the moon by how good this is. I mainly use it on my neck, hands and forearms. The difference is amazing. My skin actually feels so good. I wish I could but larger containers of it."" —Kimberly P. Get it from Amazon for $11.97. 3. A TikTok-beloved ""Soft"" perfume rollerball that honestly has no right smelling so delectable and layering so well considering it's only five cash dollars. Reviewers are obsessed with the scent's warm sweetness with a hint of citrusy zest, comparing it to waffle cones, lemon pound cake, and warm vanilla scones ... and this $65 bottle of Pink Sugar  . Promising review: ""Like so many, I found this scent on TikTok. I was a bit skeptical at first but finally got around to trying it. First off, this scent smells amazing! Almost every time I've worn it, I receive compliments. It has a sweet smell, almost like warm cake or sugar cookies with a hint of lemon. With such an affordable price, I would definitely recommend this to anyone curious about trying it."" —Chrissy Get it from Amazon for $4.16. 4. An easy-to-apply one-hour (!!) self-tanner so much cheaper and more effective than its competitors (like the $46 St. Tropez) that your medicine cabinet will laugh at the old versions you used. This vegan blend is easy for beginners to use without streaking or uneven patches, and although the tan is instant, the fade is nice and gradual. Promising review: “If you use St. Tropez tan products or any fake tanner, do yourself a favor and try this. This stuff is AWESOME. Dries quickly, lasts longer, does NOT make your skin stinky, applies evenly, and you get a fair amount of product!! Other tanners I've used become VERY noticeable when they start fading.

mov_8179EB107077613260AC2AFB1C26655D,"  Your vanity might just become a bit of an altar. 1. A tinted moisturizer with SPF 46 — this lightweight and sheer formula will give you the glow you've been waiting for. And since it's a universal tint, you won't have to worry about shopping for the perfect color to match your skin. So, if you have darker skin and the beauty aisle rarely has your shade in stock, this moisturizer is for you! Plus, it'll protect your skin from UVA and UVB rays. Flawless, protected skin? That's a no-brainer! Promising review: ""OK, so this stuff is awesome. It's a universal tinted moisturizer, so please don't expect actual coverage for blemishes. What it DOES do, however, is give you the most beautiful glow. I've gotten compliments many times wearing this product. Also, it has SPF, which is a plus. It's dewy and doesn't dry me out at all or break me out, for that matter. I wear it even at night when I'm doing a light makeup look because it's such a vibe."" —Worth it! Get it from Amazon for $31 (also available in matte and dewy finishes). 2. Or a L'Oreal glow-enhancing lotion infused with hydrating glycerin and shea butter for an illuminating tint and a sun-kissed glow that lasts all day long. Go get your shine on! Promising review: ""This is my daily go-to. It provides the perfect dewy glow to the skin without the glittery look that some other tinted moisturizers have. I don't wear a lot of makeup, so there are days I throw on my sunscreen moisturizer and put this right on top. It provides a beautiful, moist-looking shine, but no real coverage, though, so if you're trying to hide blemishes or skin discoloration, you'll still need to use a concealer or foundation base underneath. For a more made-up look, I will use my regular liquid foundation first and put this on top. It's literally perfection. I will always have this in my makeup bag."" —Jsweep Get it from Amazon for $13.98 (available in five shades). 3. A vegan under-eye brightener to help balance out bluish tones and dark circles. It's formulated with hyaluronic acid and shea butter to nourish and hydrate skin. You'll look like you've had days of sleep...even if the truth is you haven't slept in days (gosh darn, those true crime documentaries!) . This medium-coverage concealer can be applied with your fingers or a brush. Promising review: ""I believe I was born with dark circles under my eyes, and I have spent the last 50+ years looking for something that will cover my dark circles. I've spent a lot more money on products that do a lot less. And I was very hesitant to buy something so inexpensive, as I thought it would not work. I was surprised to find my circles a lot lighter, and my eyes are looking much more alert and younger. I'm very pleased with this product!"" —Lafinrsm Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). 4. And a skin-smoothing polar bear hydrating eye stick that could help reduce under-eye circles and puffiness. Its formula is enriched with glacial waters to help improve your skin's elasticity. Get ready to feel refreshed! Promising review: ""My new go-to for under-makeup eye moisture. I love the stick applicator, so I don't waste any on my fingers. It is refreshingly cold on the skin but quickly absorbs, so I can apply my makeup over it. On no-makeup days, I just wear it alone....","Your vanity might just become a bit of an altar. 1.
