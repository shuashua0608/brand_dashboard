n3fkjjx,"  So I ended up emailing Testerz last night asking if they could re-enable my account. And they did! Still a crap ton of vitamin supplements and creatine powder with some ball clamps and penis pumps/stretchers sprinkled over top, slathered in hemp based personal lubricant. BUT! There's some hidden gems. I'm always looking for skincare products, and I found some anti-aging cream that looks to be a Loreal Regenerist dupe along with under-eye serum. There's at least 3-4 pretty cool looking coloring books geared towards teens and adults. This is just one example. Do you do any homebrewing? They have a few different packs of glass bottles for home brewing and food grade fermentation jugs (not pictured). Feel like garbage? Throw one of these shower steamer pods in a hot shower for a mood boost. My bf bought me the same scent profile shower steamers from Bath&Body Works a while back and they smell great. Phlebotomy practice kits for any nursing students in your life. A single waiting room chair for reasons unbeknownst to me lol. A sweet looking travel pillow for flights. There's several family games, but I thought this pickle game looked the most fun. There's things for your lawn and garden like grass seed, ant insecticide that's allegedly for organic gardening, and there's these bug traps I hope to never have to attempt to use. Would probably just baptize the house in gas and cleanse the whole thing with fire, but that's just me. I for one like Testerz because you can give honest reviews and not have to worry about retaliation. For just one example, I tried a melatonin alternative sleepaid and gave it 2 stars. Their product list changes periodically. I hope this was a little bit more helpful. Since I'm only allowed 1 photo per post I just took a screenshot of everything grouped together.

mov_ADF6C35D9CAF6B4B45CB0162CDAF73F3,"  Ever wondered what beauty products Alex Jones uses to get herself One Show ready? The One Show presenter and Welsh icon, Alex Jones has decided to give her social media follower a little insight in to her everyday make-up items. The TV presenter filmed a video from the comfort of her car to let fans know just what products she uses when she's in a rush for the school run, that make her feel a little bit more presentable. The products range from high end companies with big price tags to drug store essentials, however there is one product that might shock you. One of her ""on-the-go beauty bits"" which she keeps in a little bag in her car and or in her handbag retails for just £3.50 from a high street store. For the latest TV and showbiz gossip sign up to our newsletter. She posted on Instagram: ""For those mornings when 'getting ready' means 3 minutes in the car mirror. These are my on-the-go beauty bits."" Alex says in the video: ""I've seen these videos where people show you what they've got in their car in terms of make-up and just bits and bobs, and some people have got, I swear the entire contents of Space NK. ""I do not have that. However when I go on the school run, I look like a witch, who's got time right?"" She then explains how she keeps a little bag in her car which features an array of products ranging from high end products like a Clinique blush that she ""absolutely loves"" and has been using for the last 15 years to an Hourglass Cosmetics eyebrow pencil to fix her ""gappy eyebrow"". However, there is one product in this bag that may surprise you, which is a mascara from Primark. The Primark False Lash Queen Volumising Mascara costs just £3.50 in store and it seems to be one of Alex's go to products. She said: ""I've tried so many mascaras right. Very often I'm disappointed because they leave like a plasticky feel on your lashes. These are the brushes I like. This is Primark. ""Keep one in the car, one in my handbag."" From £3.50 to £150, as another favourite is the Official by Redo perfume in Rose Of No Man's Land which retails for £150 for 50ml. She keeps a small bottle of the perfume in her car to smell fresh on the school run. She said: Last one, a bit of perfume, because I think even if you look like utter crap, if you spray a bit of perfume it gives you a bit of an edge. Like you've made an effort. In total she lists the following products: Balance Me Skin Care Stellar Balm- You can find this from Amazon here for £9.90Hourglass Cosmetics Arch Brow Sculpting Pencil- You can finds this from Sephora here for £37 Clinique Blushing Blush Powder- You can find this from Boots here for £32Primark False Lash Queen Volumising Mascara- You can find this from Primark for £3.50 Loreal Paris True Match The One Concealer- You can find this from Boots here for £8.99 MAC Cosmetic Studio Fix Powder-You can find this from Debenhams here for £27.20 Max Factor Lip Gloss- You can find this from Boots here for £12.99 Official by Redo perfume in Rose Of No Man's Land- You can find this from Space NK here for £150.

The products range from high end companies with big price tags to drug store essentials, however there is one product that might shock you. One of her ""on-the-go beauty bits"" which she keeps in a little bag in her car and or in her handbag retails for just £3.50 from a high street store. For the latest TV and showbiz gossip sign up to our newsletter. She posted on Instagram: ""For those mornings when 'getting ready' means 3 minutes in the car mirror. These are my on-the-go beauty bits."" Alex says in the video: ""I've seen these videos where people show you what they've got in their car in terms of make-up and just bits and bobs, and some people have got, I swear the entire contents of Space NK. ""I do not have that. However when I go on the school run, I look like a witch, who's got time right?"" She then explains how she keeps a little bag in her car which features an array of products ranging from high end products like a Clinique blush that she ""absolutely loves"" and has been using for the last 15 years to an Hourglass Cosmetics eyebrow pencil to fix her ""gappy eyebrow"". However, there is one product in this bag that may surprise you, which is a mascara from Primark. The Primark False Lash Queen Volumising Mascara costs just £3.50 in store and it seems to be one of Alex's go to products. She said: ""I've tried so many mascaras right. Very often I'm disappointed because they leave like a plasticky feel on your lashes. These are the brushes I like. This is Primark. ""Keep one in the car, one in my handbag."" From £3.50 to £150, as another favourite is the Official by Redo perfume in Rose Of No Man's Land which retails for £150 for 50ml. She keeps a small bottle of the perfume in her car to smell fresh on the school run. She said: Last one, a bit of perfume, because I think even if you look like utter crap, if you spray a bit of perfume it gives you a bit of an edge. Like you've made an effort.
