mov_532638C6F6B3DFAB22D374DE5D3B7BF4,"  New Delhi | Mumbai: Yet another market leader is headed for a leadership shake-up. Beauty and cosmetics major L'Oreal has appointed Jacques Lebel as its India country manager, replacing Aseem Kaushik who will be the company's chairman. Both appointments will be effective October 1, 2025. Lebel previously served as general manager of the consumer products division (CPD) for L'Oreal in Mexico, where he significantly accelerated business growth. Earlier, Lebel held senior marketing and general management roles at companies including P&> and AB InBev across Europe, India, the Middle East, and Africa. The Indian subsidiary of French multinational L'Oreal SA said Kaushik's new role underscores its commitment to India's dynamic market landscape with a mandate to focus on corporate reputation, managing public affairs, strengthening stakeholder engagement, and driving corporate social responsibility initiatives. ""The leadership transition is to do with catalysing growth in a high-potential market like India,"" said an executive who requested anonymity. ""Competition from the naturals segment, digital-only, and regional beauty brands, many of which sell at lower prices or through subscription-based models, has intensified very aggressively in recent years,"" the person noted. ""Incumbents can no longer take their share for granted."" This comes days after FMCG leader Hindustan Unilever on July 10 announced that its CEO and managing director of two years, Rohit Jawa, was stepping down. He will be succeeded by another Unilever veteran, Priya Nair, effective August 1. For L'Oreal, which has a legacy portfolio of brands including L'Oreal Paris, Garnier, Maybelline New York and NYX Professional Makeup, India is a core strategic market.Its global chief Nicolas Hieronimus had told reporters last month that it intends to ""more than double its production in India in the next couple of years from the current production of half-a-billion units."" In the hair and beauty salons segment, L'Oreal's portfolio includes L'Oreal Professionnel, Matrix and Kerastase. It also distributes premium labels Kiehl's, Lancome and Yves Saint Laurent in India. L'Oreal India's sales grew 14% to ₹5,685 crore during FY25 while its net profit was flat at ₹488 crore. The performance was significantly lower than previous two fiscals when its revenues grew over 30%, indicating surging competition, especially from new-age direct-to-consumer rivals that are targeting younger consumer cohorts. Kaushik joined L'Oreal in 1995 with the consumer products division and was part of the L'Oreal startup operations in India in the East and North and launched L'Oreal consumer brands like Garnier, Maybelline and L'Oreal Paris across the country. He was elevated as the country head in January 2023 after a brief stint as head of professional products in Singapore and Hong Kong. The French cosmetics firm has about 8% share of India's face-care market dominated by Hindustan Unilever with more than 40% share. L'Oreal is the market leader in the hair colour segment and has, over the past decade, trained about 3.3 million hairdressers. The company entered India three decades ago by selling affordable packs and sachets, including its largest selling product Garnier hair colour. Its reach is however only limited to only about 230 million people who have a purchasing power parity of over $20 a day. India currently accounts for just over 1% of L'Oreal's annual sales of over ₹41 billion, making it the 15th biggest market worldwide. The company expects the country to rank among its top 10 markets within the next few years with an annual revenue of ₹1 billion. India's beauty and personal care market is estimated to touch sales of $34 billion by 2028, up from $20 billion presently, a Nykaa-Redseer Strategy Consultants Beauty Trends report said. It cited ""aspirational spending, reach and discoverability through e-commerce and quick commerce, and social media influences"" as growth drivers.","New Delhi | Mumbai: Yet another market leader is headed for a leadership shake-up.

For Reprint Rights: timescontent.com","New Delhi | Mumbai: Yet another market leader is headed for a leadership shake-up. Beauty and cosmetics major L'Oreal has appointed Jacques Lebel as its India country manager, replacing Aseem Kaushik who will be the company's chairman. Both appointments will be effective October 1, 2025. Lebel previously served as general manager of the consumer products division (CPD) for L'Oreal in Mexico, where he significantly accelerated business growth. Earlier, Lebel held senior marketing and general management roles at companies including P&G and AB InBev across Europe, India, the Middle East, and Africa.The Indian subsidiary of French multinational L'Oreal SA said Kaushik's new role underscores its commitment to India's dynamic market landscape with a mandate to focus on corporate reputation, managing public affairs, strengthening stakeholder engagement, and driving corporate social responsibility initiatives. ""The leadership transition is to do with catalysing growth in a high-potential market like India,"" said an executive who requested anonymity. ""Competition from the naturals segment, digital-only, and regional beauty brands, many of which sell at lower prices or through subscription-based models, has intensified very aggressively in recent years,"" the person noted. ""Incumbents can no longer take their share for granted."" This comes days after FMCG leader Hindustan Unilever on July 10 announced that its CEO and managing director of two years, Rohit Jawa, was stepping down. He will be succeeded by another Unilever veteran, Priya Nair, effective August 1. For L'Oreal, which has a legacy portfolio of brands including L'Oreal Paris, Garnier, Maybelline New York and NYX Professional Makeup, India is a core strategic market.Its global chief Nicolas Hieronimus had told reporters last month that it intends to ""more than double its production in India in the next couple of years from the current production of half-a-billion units."" In the hair and beauty salons segment, L'Oreal's portfolio includes L'Oreal Professionnel, Matrix and Kerastase. It also distributes premium labels Kiehl's, Lancome and Yves Saint Laurent in India.L'Oreal India's sales grew 14% to �'�5,685 crore during FY25 while its net profit was flat at �'�488 crore.

1m05fj8,"  **Note: I have already posted this in another makeup subreddit but barely got any advice. I'm hoping posting it here may help… I turn red in the face and I'm struggling to cover it up properly and effectively. So, for some context as to how this began: I started a medication last Christmas and with every medication comes their side effects as most would know. I didn't know that my medication would stop me from sweating as it was always cold in the house because it was winter, but once it started getting warmer, my face would turn red often even from the littlest bit of warmth. And I know some might say that's normal and unavoidable, but I've never had it happen as often and as severe as this. In previous years, including last year, my cheeks were the only part on my face that would frequently turn red from warmth. Nowadays, my medication causes my face to turn red when I'm even just a little bit too warm. The only way to help battle the redness without makeup (and also because I'm literally too overheated to function) is to cool myself down with air conditioning because nothing else helps. The reason I'm making this post is because I have been struggling with makeup lately to help cover up my redness (oftentimes before it happens), especially when I'm leaving the house. I've never turned this red before, and even if I did, it was usually only on my cheeks, not my entire face like it is nowadays thanks to the medication… I have dry and sensitive skin, and not a lot of products have worked for me, but for a couple months now, I have been using Jason Wu's Tinted Moisturizer Meets CC Cream and it's been the best base makeup product I've used in years! I've also switched from putting the green shade from the NYX Color Corrector palette all over my face (exhausting because it takes forever to work into the skin) to recently using Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (because I use their normal Age Rewind Concealer and I've loved it since forever). I have also purchased the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer since someone I know recommended it for my situation, but I haven't tried it yet since I don't understand how it helps… And no, this post isn't just me rambling about my struggles with makeup. I'm here asking for help from those who may have experience with these products, this situation, or those who have professional makeup advice for me. There's a few issues I've been having with my makeup lately: 1. I've found that sometimes touching my face will take my tinted moisturizer right off, or if my nail presses ever so slightly onto my skin, that it'll remove the makeup in that exact area. I've tried to combat this by setting my face with the only setting powder I own, which is one from E.L.F. I just don't remember the name. I've only done this method once and it seemed to have helped but I'm unsure about how much it helped. 2. If I don't apply enough of my chosen colour corrector (remember, I still haven't tried the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer yet) underneath my tinted moisturizer, then my redness will shine through later on and it makes me feel horrible about myself (I know many people have rosacea and other skin conditions that can cause mass redness, but I'm just remaining honest on how my type of redness makes me feel, so please don't take any offence as I don't mean any…). 3. To conclude this, I'm also heavily struggling with how to make this whole process simpler and less stress-inducing because I'm oftentimes trying to cover my redness before it actually appears, so I cannot tell how much green will help combat the red. Sometimes I've used too little and later my redness peeked through my makeup, or I've used too much and I've had to put on a lot of tinted moisturizer to cover it. It was also my first time using setting powder because I was scared it would cause me to dry out because of my skin type. I just need some advice… If anyone has any questions regarding what I mentioned, then please ask. I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions from anyone who is familiar with this or knows, professionally, how to help. I'm also on a tight budget as I barely make any money nowadays, so purchasing luxury beauty products or pricy items is something I'd very much like to avoid unless there's no other way. Sorry for this jumble of stuff. I've just been so frustrated lately and I've gotten very tired of spending a lot of time looking up how to help with these things and coming up with nothing, either because the advice found didn't help or wasn't the right solution to my problem. Thank you. ***TL;DR: I've been turning red in the face from a medication I take that stops me from sweating (meaning I cannot cool myself down). I'm struggling to both cover this up and maintain my makeup without it smudging off or rubbing off by a small tap to the face.","**Note: I have already posted this in another makeup subreddit but barely got any advice.

1m0xteq,"  Hello everyone. I am fairly new in the world of makeup. It didn't interest me as a teen and then when I would have wanted to, I'm scared to look like a clown as an adult. I've been practicing at home like before shower and all but I very rarely go out with makeup because it's always a hit and miss if I'll get it how I want. They say practice is all it takes but… I feel like I don't know what I'm doing? Like I don't even know what type of eyes I got so I have no idea what kind of tutorials to look for. Specifically for eyeliner. I can't seem to find a technique, nevermind try different styles… I have no issue with waterlining, and have found the NYX Epic Ink Liner to be the easiest to use. Any recommendations on what type of line to practice first or tutorials would be welcome. Expect many posts from me in the future since this is all overwhelming to me, and will show results when I have some and figure out how to post pictures with the post.","Hello everyone.

Specifically for eyeliner. I can't seem to find a technique, nevermind try different styles… I have no issue with waterlining, and have found the NYX Epic Ink Liner to be the easiest to use. Any recommendations on what type of line to practice first or tutorials would be welcome.

mov_0A440AE19F198C9B6A9A0EFFB4306133,"  While most of us ditch our routine in the summer, I think I've found the product that's upped my makeup game Summer is hands down one of my favourite times of the year, mainly because I can skip the makeup routine, especially when a fresh tan gives that perfect sun-kissed glow. But let's be real: for those of us who feel a bit self-conscious about our skin, a little makeup can really help boost confidence while still keeping that holiday radiance alive. As someone with dry skin, finding a primer that doesn't cling to dry patches or add extra texture has always been a struggle. After a lot of trial and error, though, I think I've finally found the one: a lightweight, reliable primer that keeps my makeup in place all day and feels like second skin. Enter the Maybelline Grippy Serum. This product has completely revamped my makeup game, and it's super affordable too. At just £10 on Amazon, the combination of its ultra-blendable formula and Serum-To-Grip technology ensures your makeup stays put for up to 24 hours. It's a water-based primer that feels fresh and lightweight but never greasy, with zero white cast, making it suitable for all skin types. Plus, I find that it hydrates and plumps the skin, which creates the perfect base for makeup. Application is a easy too: simply apply a few drops with the dropper, then gently tap it in with your fingertips or a beauty blender. Within 20 seconds, the serum transforms into a grippy texture. What I love most is that as you apply your foundation, the primer gives your skin a natural, healthy glow, leaving you with a fresh, dewy finish, perfect for those summer nights. With the addition of 2% Niacinamide, it nourishes your skin while locking your makeup in place all day long, so you won't feel like it's just melting off. It's the ideal mix of skincare and makeup in one product. For money-saving tips, sign up to our Money newsletter here Indeed, lots of people on Amazon are finding similar results, with the product securing a strong 4.3 star rating. One customer shared: ""I actually love this, goes on really well and is nice and tacky in minutes. The added benefit of skincare is just an amazing quality. Foundation sits so well on top of this and lasts all day."" However, some people have pointed out that the primer may not be suitable for all, with one person saying: ""Lovely texture for more mature skin, was really excited to try this. Until I realised all of my foundations, tinted moisturisers and cc creams were silicone based and obviously water based primer repels silicone based formulas. So the makeup separated. It clearly says it in the title that it's water based, but I didn't realise that water and silicone don't play well."" If you're also a fan of silicone-based makeup and don't want to overhaul your entire makeup collection, LookFantastic offers the perfect solution: the NYX Professional Makeup Studio Perfect Primer - Clear. Priced at £10.99, this primer helps reduce unwanted shine and control excess oils while smoothing the skin for a flawless make up finish. More along the lines of the Maybelline Grippy Serum is the e.l.f. Power Grip Primer - a must try if you believe all the TikTok hype. Like the Grippy Serum, the formula goes tacky within 30 seconds, ensuring your makeup lasts all day long. Infused with hyaluronic acid, it moisturises, preps and smooths for a plump, flawless complexion. The best part? It's currently on sale at Amazon, dropping from £10 to £7.89.","While most of us ditch our routine in the summer, I think I've found the product that's upped my makeup game Summer is hands down one of my favourite times of the year, mainly because I can skip the makeup routine, especially when a fresh tan gives that perfect sun-kissed glow.

Una fusión entre pigmento y suavidad que se funde literalmente con tu piel, dejando un acabado natural, luminoso y elegante.

Ya sea que busques un look natural o algo más editorial, el Buttermelt te da la libertad de construir intensidad sin que se cuartee ni se vea sobrecargado. Además de su textura y acabado, este iluminador de NYX destaca por: Fórmula vegana y libre de crueldad animal. Aplicación sin esfuerzo: se difumina fácilmente con los dedos, brocha o esponja. Duración impecable: su brillo se mantiene intacto por horas. Compatible con todo tipo de piel, incluso las secas gracias a su textura cremosa. Su formato compacto es ideal para llevar en el bolso y retocar durante el día. Y si eres fan de los productos multiusos, te encantará saber que también puede usarse como sombra de ojos o punto de luz en el lagrimal y el arco de cupido.

mov_CDE1D311FBE394FAA4275BEB2FC22372,"  7 Beauty Products I Can't Survive Summer Without (Seriously, Take My Wallet) I really appreciate you checking out my blog! Just so you know, some of the links in this post are affiliate links. This means that if you buy something through them, I might earn a little bit of money, at no extra cost to you. There's absolutely no pressure to buy anything, but if you do, it genuinely helps support the time and love I put into writing these posts. Summer and I have a complicated relationship. I love the sunshine, the pool days, the iced coffees, and pretending I live in a Pinterest picnic. But I hate how my skin goes into oil factory mode, my makeup melts off faster than my motivation, and my hair turns into a fuzzball that could rival a lion's mane. Over the years, I've tried dozens of beauty products promising to “beat the heat,” but most of them let me down—like that one friend who always cancels last minute. So after way too much trial and error, I've found my ride-or-dies: 7 beauty products I literally cannot live without during the summer months. They're affordable, all on Amazon (because yes, I'm a Prime-addicted human), and they actually do what they claim. Let's get into it. 1. e.l.f. Power Grip Primer Buy on Amazon → Let me start by saying: this stuff is glue. In the best way possible. I used to skip primer because I thought it was a scam. But once summer hits and my foundation starts sliding off like it's auditioning for Cirque du Soleil, I need something to holdit together. This primer grips my makeup like it's its job (because it is) and gives me that smooth, hydrated finish without being greasy. Bonus: It feels just like a dupe for that expensive Milk Makeup one… but it's like $10. Win-win. 2. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Hyaluronic Acid Buy on Amazon → My skin gets confused in the summer. It's dry in patches, oily in others, and occasionally acts like it's mad at me for drinking iced coffee instead of water. This gel moisturizer saved me. It's light, cooling, and soaks in like a dream without leaving a film. I use it morning and night—and sometimes right after I come in from the heat, just to feel something soothing. It feels like giving my skin a tall glass of water. No breakouts, no sticky residue, just happy, bouncy skin. 3. NYX Bare With Me Concealer Serum Buy on Amazon → Foundation in the summer? No thank you. I'm not trying to bake a cake on my face. Instead, I've been living for this lightweight concealer serum. It's buildable, blends like a dream, and looks like skin—not like a mask.

Life....","7 Beauty Products I Can't Survive Summer Without (Seriously, Take My Wallet) I really appreciate you checking out my blog! Just so you know, some of the links in this post are affiliate links. This means that if you buy something through them, I might earn a little bit of money, at no extra cost to you. There's absolutely no pressure to buy anything, but if you do, it genuinely helps support the time and love I put into writing these posts. Summer and I have a complicated relationship. I love the sunshine, the pool days, the iced coffees, and pretending I live in a Pinterest picnic. But I hate how my skin goes into oil factory mode, my makeup melts off faster than my motivation, and my hair turns into a fuzzball that could rival a lion's mane. Over the years, I've tried dozens of beauty products promising to “beat the heat,” but most of them let me down—like that one friend who always cancels last minute. So after way too much trial and error, I've found my ride-or-dies: 7 beauty products I literally cannot live without during the summer months. They're affordable, all on Amazon (because yes, I'm a Prime-addicted human), and they actually do what they claim. Let's get into it. 1. e.l.f. Power Grip Primer Buy on Amazon → Let me start by saying: this stuff is glue. In the best way possible. I used to skip primer because I thought it was a scam. But once summer hits and my foundation starts sliding off like it's auditioning for Cirque du Soleil, I need something to holdit together. This primer grips my makeup like it's its job (because it is) and gives me that smooth, hydrated finish without being greasy. Bonus: It feels just like a dupe for that expensive Milk Makeup one… but it's like $10. Win-win. 2. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Hyaluronic Acid Buy on Amazon → My skin gets confused in the summer. It's dry in patches, oily in others, and occasionally acts like it's mad at me for drinking iced coffee instead of water. This gel moisturizer saved me. It's light, cooling, and soaks in like a dream without leaving a film. I use it morning and night—and sometimes right after I come in from the heat, just to feel something soothing. It feels like giving my skin a tall glass of water. No breakouts, no sticky residue, just happy, bouncy skin. 3. NYX Bare With Me Concealer Serum Buy on Amazon → Foundation in the summer? No thank you. I'm not trying to bake a cake on my face. Instead, I've been living for this lightweight concealer serum. It's buildable, blends like a dream, and looks like skin—not like a mask. I use it under my eyes, around my nose, and on any little blemish trying to ruin my day. It doesn't crease, doesn't melt, and somehow makes me look like I actually slept last night. Which, spoiler: I didn't. 4. Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant Buy on Amazon → Let's talk clogged pores.

mov_D7177EDC87D30678CFC88808773DD4C0,"  Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey is one of those beloved, once-in-a-generation beauty sensations that seem impossible to replicate. The iconic lipstick was first launched in 1989 and quickly became a Gen X makeup mainstay with legions of devoted fans (including '90s-era Drew Barrymore). In fact, even today, one tube is sold every three minutes, according to Clinique. What makes the Black Honey shade so special? The formula is universally flattering, specially designed out of a blend of blue, red and yellow pigments, so it works for any and all skin tones. As it turns out, there are even more options for Black Honey devotees: Clinique now offers a Pop Lip + Cheek Oil in Black Honey. The internet — and the Gen X crowd in my over-50 group chat — are both currently obsessed. Clinique This tinted oil is ultra-versatile (use it on lips, cheeks or anywhere you want a hint of color) and leaves your skin looking dewy and just a bit flushed. It's also allergy-tested, fragrance-free and safe for all skin types. $27 at Macy's ""YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS,"" one friend emphatically texted. ""I think it's even better than the lipstick!!!"" another enthusiastic pal chimed in. The Pop Lip + Cheek Oil truly does live up to the hype. It's versatile, highly portable and easy to use. It's an oil, yes, but it doesn't migrate the way some products with this type of texture will. The dewy finish is pretty and glowy and especially good for older, drier skin. As a blush, it rivals Benefit's famous Benetint, except the formula here is less thin and unwieldy and you actually have a good deal of control over the pigment, which you can build. Best of all, like the lipstick, the Black Honey oil looks dark in the tube but, once on, works like a customized tint, lightly staining cheeks and lips the most natural-looking cherry hue that's just a hint or two above bare. The application itself couldn't be more foolproof — you dab on a little of the product with the handy sponge applicator and blend it in with your fingers. It leaves your skin looking subtly flushed, like you've been outside exerting yourself in the freshest air, not scowling at a screen all day. All of which is to say, the group chat was right: This is one of my favorite products I've tested all year. If, however, $27 feels a little steep for something you swoop on your cheeks, I've also tracked down a few solid and more affordable Black Honey swaps for this new tinted oil. Amazon Elf's tinted oil is more pigmented than the Clinique version and stays on a bit longer too. The texture is slightly stickier, but worth the close to 60% savings in cost. Sure, it's not esigned for cheeks, but it's versatile enough to be used that way. Makeup rules were made to be broken! I won't tell if you won't. $8 at Amazon Amazon NYX's deep berry shade is similar to Black Honey, if a teensy bit rosier. Like the Elf, it's more pigmented and stays on longer too. Reviewers do find it more gloss than cheek oil, and the consistency is on the stickier side. $9 at Macy's If you have Amazon Prime, you'll get free shipping, of course. Not yet a member? No problem. You can sign up for your free 30-day trial here.

Peach Slices Redness Relief Color Correcting Cream for those days when your skin seems to be pitching a fit about one thing or another.
