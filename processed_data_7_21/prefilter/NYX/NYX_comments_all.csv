WWE Evolution 2025 (2025-07-13) – Michael Cole & Wade Barrett kommenterar. – Joe Tessitore och Stephanie McMahon håller i analyserna, och Steph kommer in till så mycket burkljud att det blir rent pinsamt. Det är en sak om de förstärker publikresponsen så det ser naturligt ut, men medan publiken sitter stilla och knappt verkar vakna låter det som om Beatlemania is running wild ljudmässigt och då blir det alldeles för uppenbart vad de håller på med. Vad hon gör här? Fan vet, men hon säger något om att den första Evolution-PPVn var en sådan succé att det kom en uppföljare. Wow, vilket succé som gjorde att de väntade i SJU år till nästa. 1. Womens IC-champ Becky Lynch vs. Bayley vs. Lyra Valkyria. Titelmatch och första fallet gäller. Jag var inte så pepp på denna men kunde inte sätta fingret på varför innan jag läste en kommentar om att alla tre är åt heelhållet så storyn saknar en klar sympatisk babyface. Håller med till fullo. Lyra och Bayley är ju tekniskt sett babyfaces men gnäller för mycket, vilka tror de att de är egentligen? Svenska wrestlingrecensenter? Med det sagt var matchen i sig riktigt, riktigt bra. Jag går till och med så långt att jag tycker den var magnifik och bättre än något på All In Texas! Enormt välutförda spots med kanonräddningar, flera gånger under nearfalls kom räddningen preciiiiiis före tre, och det fina kameraarbetet gjorde att det inte telegraferades lång väg. Speciellt Lyra har en förmåga att veta EXAKT när hon ska dyka in och avbryta pinfallen. Mot slutet sätter Bayley en Rose Plant på Lyra varpå Becky nästan hjular in mot henne och backslidar Bayley för tre efter 16:26. Läcker slutspot! Detta var den bästa matchen jag sett på länge, oavsett förbund. Vinnare: Becky. ****1/4 – Ava, Mark Henry och Vickie Guerrero sitter i publiken, varav den sistnämnde tydligen ska göra comeback som karaktär. Jag vet inte, det där störiga ”EXCUSE ME!” funkade väl när det begav sig men inget jag skulle vilja se igen så jag hoppas de har någon bättre plan än det där gapandet i tid och otid. Senare föräras våra känsliga synorgan även med Jazz, Ivory, Jackie Moore (61 år gammal och åldras med värdighet!) , Maryse, Torrie Wilson, Melina, Molly Holly, Madusa och Leilani Kai samt diverse rappare och annat löst folk jag såklart inte har en susning om vilka de är. Fast det är nog rätt ömsesidigt, de vet nog inte heller vem jag är. 2. NXT Womens-champ Jacy Jayne vs. Jordynne Grace. Titelmatch och både Fallon Henley och Jazmyn Nyx är med Jacy in medan Blake Monroe (Mariah May) är med utmanaren in. Jag ser som bekant inte NXT så har inte en susning om bakgrunden här, vilket säkerligen inverkar på underhållningsvärdet för mig. Bra match helt klart men inget jag kommer minnas när HHH och Lee Fittings namn läses i eftertexterna. Jacy ranar ner Jordynne från hörnan och sensationellt nog kallar Cole det för en sådan istället för en Frankensteiner! Otroligt. Scott Steiner kanske läxade upp honom angående namnet igår på SNME. Mot slutet whippar Jordynne sin motståndare mot repen, där Monroe står, men Jacy reverserar så Jordynne rusar mot repen och sopas till av Monroe så Jace kan avsluta med The Rolling Encore (discus-punch) efter 10:29. I tråden på F4W/WO-forumet var de inbitna NXT-tittarna säkra på att Monroe skulle vända heel mot Jordynne här, så jag antar det var medvetet gjort även om hon fick det att framstå som ren otur att Jacy kunde reversera whippen där. Vinnare: Jacy. **1/2 – Joe och Steph ”analyserar” NXT-matchen en stund vilket mest dödar tid. Blake har sagt i intervjuer att hånglandet med Toni Storm och Mina Shirakawa på AEW-TV var helt på eget initiativ och ombads sluta med det av AEW-höjdarna, vilket såklart fick igång rykten om hennes kärlekspreferenser. Här säger Steph att ”she's out… for herself”, och även om det är tydligt att hon stakar sig var det lite komiskt med det i bakhuvudet. Jag vill dock understryka att detta är EN HÖNA AV EN FJÄDER och inga slutsatser därför ska dras. Tyckte som sagt bara det var lite lustigt i sammanhanget. 3. WWE Womens Tag-champs Roxanne Perez & Raquel Rodriguez vs. Charlotte Flair & Alexa Bliss vs. Kabuki Warriors vs. Sol Ruca & Zaria. Titelmatch och första fallet gäller. Asuka har sminkat några svarta horisontella streck i nyllet idag ala Peter Criss (originaltrummis i Kiss) men det är nog mest en slump skulle jag tro. Underhållande match!...","SPR_COMBO[sv]8.

He doesn't really need to be great on each of his abilities, just good enough to hold you over until you get something new, and for that he's really good.

mov_532638C6F6B3DFAB22D374DE5D3B7BF4,"  New Delhi | Mumbai: Yet another market leader is headed for a leadership shake-up. Beauty and cosmetics major L'Oreal has appointed Jacques Lebel as its India country manager, replacing Aseem Kaushik who will be the company's chairman. Both appointments will be effective October 1, 2025. Lebel previously served as general manager of the consumer products division (CPD) for L'Oreal in Mexico, where he significantly accelerated business growth. Earlier, Lebel held senior marketing and general management roles at companies including P&> and AB InBev across Europe, India, the Middle East, and Africa. The Indian subsidiary of French multinational L'Oreal SA said Kaushik's new role underscores its commitment to India's dynamic market landscape with a mandate to focus on corporate reputation, managing public affairs, strengthening stakeholder engagement, and driving corporate social responsibility initiatives. ""The leadership transition is to do with catalysing growth in a high-potential market like India,"" said an executive who requested anonymity. ""Competition from the naturals segment, digital-only, and regional beauty brands, many of which sell at lower prices or through subscription-based models, has intensified very aggressively in recent years,"" the person noted. ""Incumbents can no longer take their share for granted."" This comes days after FMCG leader Hindustan Unilever on July 10 announced that its CEO and managing director of two years, Rohit Jawa, was stepping down. He will be succeeded by another Unilever veteran, Priya Nair, effective August 1. For L'Oreal, which has a legacy portfolio of brands including L'Oreal Paris, Garnier, Maybelline New York and NYX Professional Makeup, India is a core strategic market.Its global chief Nicolas Hieronimus had told reporters last month that it intends to ""more than double its production in India in the next couple of years from the current production of half-a-billion units."" In the hair and beauty salons segment, L'Oreal's portfolio includes L'Oreal Professionnel, Matrix and Kerastase. It also distributes premium labels Kiehl's, Lancome and Yves Saint Laurent in India. L'Oreal India's sales grew 14% to ₹5,685 crore during FY25 while its net profit was flat at ₹488 crore. The performance was significantly lower than previous two fiscals when its revenues grew over 30%, indicating surging competition, especially from new-age direct-to-consumer rivals that are targeting younger consumer cohorts. Kaushik joined L'Oreal in 1995 with the consumer products division and was part of the L'Oreal startup operations in India in the East and North and launched L'Oreal consumer brands like Garnier, Maybelline and L'Oreal Paris across the country. He was elevated as the country head in January 2023 after a brief stint as head of professional products in Singapore and Hong Kong. The French cosmetics firm has about 8% share of India's face-care market dominated by Hindustan Unilever with more than 40% share. L'Oreal is the market leader in the hair colour segment and has, over the past decade, trained about 3.3 million hairdressers. The company entered India three decades ago by selling affordable packs and sachets, including its largest selling product Garnier hair colour. Its reach is however only limited to only about 230 million people who have a purchasing power parity of over $20 a day. India currently accounts for just over 1% of L'Oreal's annual sales of over ₹41 billion, making it the 15th biggest market worldwide. The company expects the country to rank among its top 10 markets within the next few years with an annual revenue of ₹1 billion. India's beauty and personal care market is estimated to touch sales of $34 billion by 2028, up from $20 billion presently, a Nykaa-Redseer Strategy Consultants Beauty Trends report said. It cited ""aspirational spending, reach and discoverability through e-commerce and quick commerce, and social media influences"" as growth drivers.","New Delhi | Mumbai: Yet another market leader is headed for a leadership shake-up.

1m05fj8,"  **Note: I have already posted this in another makeup subreddit but barely got any advice. I'm hoping posting it here may help… I turn red in the face and I'm struggling to cover it up properly and effectively. So, for some context as to how this began: I started a medication last Christmas and with every medication comes their side effects as most would know. I didn't know that my medication would stop me from sweating as it was always cold in the house because it was winter, but once it started getting warmer, my face would turn red often even from the littlest bit of warmth. And I know some might say that's normal and unavoidable, but I've never had it happen as often and as severe as this. In previous years, including last year, my cheeks were the only part on my face that would frequently turn red from warmth. Nowadays, my medication causes my face to turn red when I'm even just a little bit too warm. The only way to help battle the redness without makeup (and also because I'm literally too overheated to function) is to cool myself down with air conditioning because nothing else helps. The reason I'm making this post is because I have been struggling with makeup lately to help cover up my redness (oftentimes before it happens), especially when I'm leaving the house. I've never turned this red before, and even if I did, it was usually only on my cheeks, not my entire face like it is nowadays thanks to the medication… I have dry and sensitive skin, and not a lot of products have worked for me, but for a couple months now, I have been using Jason Wu's Tinted Moisturizer Meets CC Cream and it's been the best base makeup product I've used in years! I've also switched from putting the green shade from the NYX Color Corrector palette all over my face (exhausting because it takes forever to work into the skin) to recently using Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (because I use their normal Age Rewind Concealer and I've loved it since forever). I have also purchased the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer since someone I know recommended it for my situation, but I haven't tried it yet since I don't understand how it helps… And no, this post isn't just me rambling about my struggles with makeup. I'm here asking for help from those who may have experience with these products, this situation, or those who have professional makeup advice for me. There's a few issues I've been having with my makeup lately: 1. I've found that sometimes touching my face will take my tinted moisturizer right off, or if my nail presses ever so slightly onto my skin, that it'll remove the makeup in that exact area. I've tried to combat this by setting my face with the only setting powder I own, which is one from E.L.F. I just don't remember the name. I've only done this method once and it seemed to have helped but I'm unsure about how much it helped. 2. If I don't apply enough of my chosen colour corrector (remember, I still haven't tried the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer yet) underneath my tinted moisturizer, then my redness will shine through later on and it makes me feel horrible about myself (I know many people have rosacea and other skin conditions that can cause mass redness, but I'm just remaining honest on how my type of redness makes me feel, so please don't take any offence as I don't mean any…). 3. To conclude this, I'm also heavily struggling with how to make this whole process simpler and less stress-inducing because I'm oftentimes trying to cover my redness before it actually appears, so I cannot tell how much green will help combat the red. Sometimes I've used too little and later my redness peeked through my makeup, or I've used too much and I've had to put on a lot of tinted moisturizer to cover it. It was also my first time using setting powder because I was scared it would cause me to dry out because of my skin type. I just need some advice… If anyone has any questions regarding what I mentioned, then please ask. I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions from anyone who is familiar with this or knows, professionally, how to help. I'm also on a tight budget as I barely make any money nowadays, so purchasing luxury beauty products or pricy items is something I'd very much like to avoid unless there's no other way. Sorry for this jumble of stuff. I've just been so frustrated lately and I've gotten very tired of spending a lot of time looking up how to help with these things and coming up with nothing, either because the advice found didn't help or wasn't the right solution to my problem. Thank you. ***TL;DR: I've been turning red in the face from a medication I take that stops me from sweating (meaning I cannot cool myself down). I'm struggling to both cover this up and maintain my makeup without it smudging off or rubbing off by a small tap to the face.","**Note: I have already posted this in another makeup subreddit but barely got any advice.

287FC85750B6D25CB3DEEE4A35A2B21C,"  New Delhi | Mumbai: Yet another market leader is headed for a leadership   shake-up. Beauty and cosmetics   major L'Oreal India is set to replace its country head and managing   director Aseem Kaushik amid intensifying competition, industry   executives aware of the development   said. The Indian subsidiary of French multinational L'Oreal SA is bringing   in an expat to lead its day-to-day operations, while Kaushik is expected   to move to another role in the organisation, they said. ""The leadership transition is to do with catalysing growth in a high-potential market like India,"" said one of the executives who requested   anonymity. ""Competition from the naturals segment, digital-only, and regional beauty brands, many of which sell at lower prices or through subscription-based models, has intensified   very aggressively in recent years,"" the person noted. ""Incumbents can no longer take their share for granted."" When contacted, a L'Oreal India   spokesperson said the company   does not have any comments   to offer. This comes days after FMCG leader Hindustan Unilever on July 10 announced that its CEO and managing director of two years, Rohit Jawa, was stepping   down. He will be succeeded by another Unilever veteran, Priya   Nair, effective August 1. For L'Oreal, which has a legacy portfolio of brands including L'Oreal Paris, Garnier, Maybelline New York and NYX Professional Makeup, India is a core strategic market.

1m116eb,"  Let me preface this with a warning: if you're the kind of person who reads BookTok, drinks aggressively medium roast coffee, and thinks red flags are a suggestion—this is your story. Or mine. I'm Rhys. 32. Male. Once naïve. Now seasoned like a cast iron skillet that's been through a few grease fires. This all kicked off back in 2021. But rewind a bit: Amarantha (32F) and I have known each other since high school. Same neighborhood. Same awkward teenage friend groups. She got married young to a guy who was such a piece of work he skipped town and life itself before their divorce was finalized. So technically, she's a widow. I'd been through my own brand of trauma—which I won't unpack here, for your mental health and mine—but suffice to say, when we reconnected, sparks flew. Or maybe that was a red flare. Who can say? We dated for six whirlwind months before getting married. Quick wedding, normal family chaos. Then she took a “find-myself” trip to Europe, which sounds fun until you find out she was drugged by some of her travel companions and came home with a concussion and a whole new personality: emotionally volatile with a side of gaslight. It started slow. A jab here, a dig there. But over time, she stopped pulling punches. She'd twist open the wounds of my past and salt them like a line cook at Red Lobster. Yet, paradoxically, when I was at my lowest, she'd console me—like a fireman lighting the match and then handing you the hose. That emotional whiplash? It gave her control. Full-on isolation mode. She excommunicated me from my own family, moved us across state lines, and slowly turned my life into a hostage situation where the ransom was my sense of self. By 2019 (yes, we're time-skipping like a bad Netflix miniseries), we were in couples therapy. Eight therapists, to be exact. They all saw the same thing: I was doing everything I could and she was constantly shifting the goalposts. We finally found a therapist who said the same thing as the others, but with just the right phrasing to not make Amarantha feel ""attacked."" Progress, right? Naturally, we celebrated with the worst decision two broken Millennials could make: we had a baby to save the marriage. Enter Nyx—our daughter, my light, my anchor, the only genuinely good thing to come out of this emotional FEMA site of a relationship. Amarantha nearly died during the pregnancy, which understandably changed her, but she weaponized that bitterness like a dagger made of unpaid therapy bills. I did everything—night feeds, diaper runs, mental health check-ins—but nothing was enough. The goalposts? Gone. We're not even playing the same sport anymore. Oh, and if you thought this was going to stay a two-player game—think again. Amarantha is bisexual and had always manipulated our dynamic, holding threesomes with women over my head like some twisted ""if you're a good boy, maybe"" reward chart. Fast forward to 2021: she meets Celestina at her new job. They hit it off. Then she suggests a throuple. That's right: a three-way relationship where we're all dating each other. Shockingly, it kind of worked—for like a minute. We had a wild night together (and yes, it was as mind-blowing as the 17-year-old me would've dreamed). But just as we started house-hunting, Celestina flipped the narrative. Suddenly, I was the financial deadweight, the reason we were “bleeding money.”...","Let me preface this with a warning: if you're the kind of person who reads BookTok, drinks aggressively medium roast coffee, and thinks red flags are a suggestion—this is your story. Or mine. I'm Rhys. 32. Male. Once naïve. Now seasoned like a cast iron skillet that's been through a few grease fires. This all kicked off back in 2021. But rewind a bit: Amarantha (32F) and I have known each other since high school. Same neighborhood. Same awkward teenage friend groups. She got married young to a guy who was such a piece of work he skipped town and life itself before their divorce was finalized. So technically, she's a widow. I'd been through my own brand of trauma—which I won't unpack here, for your mental health and mine—but suffice to say, when we reconnected, sparks flew. Or maybe that was a red flare. Who can say? We dated for six whirlwind months before getting married. Quick wedding, normal family chaos. Then she took a “find-myself” trip to Europe, which sounds fun until you find out she was drugged by some of her travel companions and came home with a concussion and a whole new personality: emotionally volatile with a side of gaslight. It started slow. A jab here, a dig there. But over time, she stopped pulling punches. She'd twist open the wounds of my past and salt them like a line cook at Red Lobster. Yet, paradoxically, when I was at my lowest, she'd console me—like a fireman lighting the match and then handing you the hose. That emotional whiplash? It gave her control. Full-on isolation mode. She excommunicated me from my own family, moved us across state lines, and slowly turned my life into a hostage situation where the ransom was my sense of self. By 2019 (yes, we're time-skipping like a bad Netflix miniseries), we were in couples therapy. Eight therapists, to be exact. They all saw the same thing: I was doing everything I could and she was constantly shifting the goalposts. We finally found a therapist who said the same thing as the others, but with just the right phrasing to not make Amarantha feel ""attacked."" Progress, right? Naturally, we celebrated with the worst decision two broken Millennials could make: we had a baby to save the marriage. Enter Nyx—our daughter, my light, my anchor, the only genuinely good thing to come out of this emotional FEMA site of a relationship. Amarantha nearly died during the pregnancy, which understandably changed her, but she weaponized that bitterness like a dagger made of unpaid therapy bills. I did everything—night feeds, diaper runs, mental health check-ins—but nothing was enough. The goalposts? Gone. We're not even playing the same sport anymore. Oh, and if you thought this was going to stay a two-player game—think again. Amarantha is bisexual and had always manipulated our dynamic, holding threesomes with women over my head like some twisted ""if you're a good boy, maybe"" reward chart. Fast forward to 2021: she meets Celestina at her new job. They hit it off. Then she suggests a throuple. That's right: a three-way relationship where we're all dating each other. Shockingly, it kind of worked—for like a minute. We had a wild night together (and yes, it was as mind-blowing as the 17-year-old me would've dreamed).

And in regard to Azriel's loyalty to the Night Court, we have been shown several times that the NC will not stop Azriel from pursuing what he wants, coming from the guy that says >""Chain me to a tree, Rhys,"" Azriel said softly. ""Go ahead."" He began checking the buckles on his weapons. ""I'll rip it out of the ground and fly with it on my damned back."" Also, SJM in an interview said that spin-offs were going to each focus on a new couple. But let's say that Elain and Lucien were going to be end game. Here's my problem again. Elain becomes a tool to motivate Lucien's story and not necessarily her own. Now yes, she likes to travel, but Azriel travels too through his shadows. And as a spymaster I am sure there is a lot of traveling his job requires to get intel on other Courts. One of my big speculations for the next book is we are going to see Elain travel with Lucian (who is serving as the Night Court's emissary) and Azriel will probably be forced to tag along by Rhys. Elain is probably going to be pressured to accept the mating bond for the overall good as it is stated in ACOSF: >Elain had squared her shoulders and declared that she was part of [The Night Court]—and would do whatever was needed."" If it meant to protect the Night Court, especially Nyx, she would *try* to accept the mating bond with Lucien. But I think from just how their relationship had developed over the next couple of books—it's awkward, uncomfortable.

When they released Logan's ""Origin"" however, things just didn't jive with me any longer. His whole backstory seemed to be rewritten. Since then every, X-men based series is oversaturated with Logan. He isn't the unsung hero with a mysterious/troubled past that he used to be. When Laura came on the scene in Evolution and NYX, it perked my ears up but I didn't pay it much attention. When Kyle and Yost re-booted her with New X-Men, and then her origin story was released, I was hooked. She is a hero deep down but has trouble getting away from her dark and violent past. She doesn't shy away from doing what needs to be done for the greater good. It just seemed so perfect that she descended from my favorite hero too. Ultimately, I see Laura as a better Wolverine for this day and age. A female anti-hero who is the best there is at what she does. She has fought all of the X-men's old enemies (and new ones!) , been to outer space, time travelled, and sacrificed it all to save others so many times.

n3ijepl,"  Mind expanding on that a bit? Are you referring to like the crowd that hate reads (or more likely doesn't actually read it) and like roots for her failure? Or like those who just are possibly a bit overly critical as they are quite invested in her as a character. But yeah I also try to be positive and give each series / creative team a shot. I mean I guess I'd also agree that it's generally been trending upward, but I think that's more just that I think issue 2 and 3 were worse in context of Laura's voice than the rest of the run has been, rather than I have been impressed at all with the rest of the run. As for like the team's intent, I'm sure they want to do a good job / get Laura right, I don't see any like reason to assume otherwise. It just largely hasn't worked for me. I don't really know that they are changing anything about the series and their plans though to make it more responsive / in line with what the fans want though, and not just going down the route they already had generally planned, as everything seems generally in line with with what she talked about in an interview in April about her ideas & like general pitch for the book. As for it being ""more in line with what we want as fans"", you'd have to expand upon what you mean there, but I don't think it's really been that for me. Or at least that the ways in which that statement is true don't outweigh the negatives of the book for me, so far at least. I am happy to see Gabby included again, though (I assume that's something you are referring to). Well, All New X-Men by Bendis & Hopeless is a pretty low bar as far as Laura content goes, so I don't really disagree about those. But for your 2nd statement, is that supposed to be inclusive or exclusive when you say between Tamaki's X-23 and Kelly & Lanzing's NYX? I don't actually agree either way, but I'm curious. If it's inclusive, I personally would rate Nyx higher and think it generally or issues 2 + 8 (the more Laura focused issues) did a better job on a character exploration / introspection / writing level for Laura than LKW has. I also have some mixed feelings on Tamaki's X-23, but I feel it definitely has higher highs for me than LKW has had so far. And if it's not inclusive I still think there are Laura stories in between Tamaki X-23 and Kelly & Lanzing Nyx, that I would rate higher than LKW. Not like a lot, as it wasn't like a great era for Laura, but still. Ignoring X-Terminators as it's more a comedy action book and not exactly a Laura character book (although I definitely enjoyed it more than LKW), I still think like the Paknadel X-Men Infinity story Eany Come Home, which featured Laura was a better Laura story than any in LKW so far. I also, despite some problems I had with the book as a whole, probably would rate Deadly Regenesis higher in the context of Laura character writing than LKW too, although that maybe kind of doesn't count as they both are written by Schultz.","Mind expanding on that a bit?

n3jtjwk,"  I echo what others have said here, but one thing I've always wondered is what exactly would an Elizabeth game entail? Assuming it's a RPG or an action game, what kind of content would there be to fill an entire game's worth? Like how would the plot be set up that you would have villains to fight and dungeons to progress through, and ultimately how you could even make it so that by the end of this adventure, you end up saving Makoto while not undoing his effort or getting rid of death and other human desires? I'm not saying it's not possible of course, I just feel like the circumstances around Elizabeth's goal doesn't seem to lend itself to a proper Persona game, not without introducing new layers to the lore like another powerful eldritch entity like Nyx. But then you run the risk of retcons or sketchy powerscaling to mess up the lore further. I feel like if this plotline ever gets a proper conclusion, it will be the cherry on top of some spin-off like a PQ3 or new Arena. Where maybe something kinda silly like the Wild Cards combine to fuse multiple arcanas into one to defeat the villain, and Elizabeth then takes the residual power to create a new seal that doesn't require Makoto to hold, therefore saving him. Idk, just something that isn't the main focus of the game.","I echo what others have said here, but one thing I've always wondered is what exactly would an Elizabeth game entail?

mov_0A440AE19F198C9B6A9A0EFFB4306133,"  While most of us ditch our routine in the summer, I think I've found the product that's upped my makeup game Summer is hands down one of my favourite times of the year, mainly because I can skip the makeup routine, especially when a fresh tan gives that perfect sun-kissed glow. But let's be real: for those of us who feel a bit self-conscious about our skin, a little makeup can really help boost confidence while still keeping that holiday radiance alive. As someone with dry skin, finding a primer that doesn't cling to dry patches or add extra texture has always been a struggle. After a lot of trial and error, though, I think I've finally found the one: a lightweight, reliable primer that keeps my makeup in place all day and feels like second skin. Enter the Maybelline Grippy Serum. This product has completely revamped my makeup game, and it's super affordable too. At just £10 on Amazon, the combination of its ultra-blendable formula and Serum-To-Grip technology ensures your makeup stays put for up to 24 hours. It's a water-based primer that feels fresh and lightweight but never greasy, with zero white cast, making it suitable for all skin types. Plus, I find that it hydrates and plumps the skin, which creates the perfect base for makeup. Application is a easy too: simply apply a few drops with the dropper, then gently tap it in with your fingertips or a beauty blender. Within 20 seconds, the serum transforms into a grippy texture. What I love most is that as you apply your foundation, the primer gives your skin a natural, healthy glow, leaving you with a fresh, dewy finish, perfect for those summer nights. With the addition of 2% Niacinamide, it nourishes your skin while locking your makeup in place all day long, so you won't feel like it's just melting off. It's the ideal mix of skincare and makeup in one product. For money-saving tips, sign up to our Money newsletter here Indeed, lots of people on Amazon are finding similar results, with the product securing a strong 4.3 star rating. One customer shared: ""I actually love this, goes on really well and is nice and tacky in minutes. The added benefit of skincare is just an amazing quality. Foundation sits so well on top of this and lasts all day."" However, some people have pointed out that the primer may not be suitable for all, with one person saying: ""Lovely texture for more mature skin, was really excited to try this. Until I realised all of my foundations, tinted moisturisers and cc creams were silicone based and obviously water based primer repels silicone based formulas. So the makeup separated. It clearly says it in the title that it's water based, but I didn't realise that water and silicone don't play well."" If you're also a fan of silicone-based makeup and don't want to overhaul your entire makeup collection, LookFantastic offers the perfect solution: the NYX Professional Makeup Studio Perfect Primer - Clear. Priced at £10.99, this primer helps reduce unwanted shine and control excess oils while smoothing the skin for a flawless make up finish. More along the lines of the Maybelline Grippy Serum is the e.l.f. Power Grip Primer - a must try if you believe all the TikTok hype. Like the Grippy Serum, the formula goes tacky within 30 seconds, ensuring your makeup lasts all day long. Infused with hyaluronic acid, it moisturises, preps and smooths for a plump, flawless complexion. The best part? It's currently on sale at Amazon, dropping from £10 to £7.89.","While most of us ditch our routine in the summer, I think I've found the product that's upped my makeup game Summer is hands down one of my favourite times of the year, mainly because I can skip the makeup routine, especially when a fresh tan gives that perfect sun-kissed glow.

fd7dc239068aad7d339120b65daf5efb,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Frau Kamski, herzliche Gratulation zur Wahl in den SWA-Vorstand. Gibt es Anliegen, die Ihnen am Herzen liegen und die Sie im Kundenverband gerne voranbringen wollen? Als neues SWA-Vorstandsmitglied möchte ich die Transformation der Werbebranche aktiv mitgestalten und auf die veränderte Mediennutzung mit innovativen, authentischen Werbemöglichkeiten reagieren. Drei Schwerpunkte liegen mir dabei besonders am Herzen. Erstens: die Digitalisierung der Medienlandschaft mit klaren Standards und mehr Transparenz begleiten und auch die programmatische Buchbarkeit fördern. Zweitens: die Werbemöglichkeiten im stark wachsenden Streaming-Bereich strategisch erschliessen. Und drittens: im Retail Media durch die Etablierung von Marktstandards, zum Beispiel bei Formaten oder KPIs, sowie von einheitlicher Technologie Erfolg besser messbar machen und Skalierbarkeit schaffen. Hier sehe ich den SWA als wichtigen Impulsgeber und möchte mich für diese Themen engagieren. L'Oréal vertreibt in der Schweiz mehr als 30 Marken. Wie ist das Marketing organisiert: Wofür ist L'Oréal Suisse in Vernier zuständig, und was wird im DACH-Raum umgesetzt? Das Marketing für die Marken der L'Oréal-Gruppe ist zentral in Düsseldorf aufgestellt und steuert die Aktivitäten in allen drei Ländern. So schaffen wir strategische Synergien. Eine enge Zusammenarbeit mit Go-to-Market-Teams in der Schweiz und in Österreich gewährleistet, dass die Marketingaktivitäten optimal auf die Schweizer und die Österreicher Konsumentinnen und Konsumenten zugeschnitten sind und lokale Besonderheiten berücksichtigt werden. Sie sind für Media im DACH-Raum verantwortlich. Gibt es wesentliche Unterschiede im Media-Einsatz von L'Oréal in diesen drei Ländern? Wir verfolgen zwar eine übergreifende DACH-Media-Strategie, passen diese aber an die jeweiligen Marktgegebenheiten an. Unterschiedliche Marktgrössen, kulturelle Nuancen, Mediennutzung und regulatorische Rahmenbedingungen in Deutschland, Österreich und der Schweiz erfordern massgeschneiderte Ansätze. So ergänzen wir internationale Partnerschaften durch lokale Kooperationen und entwickeln spezifischen Content. Besonders spannend ist die Entwicklung von Digital-TV und Retail Media, die in Deutschland mit Angeboten wie Prime Video, Sky und Netflix Werbung sowie Retail-Media-Anzeigen bereits fortgeschrittener sind. Wir beobachten und begleiten die Entwicklung in Österreich und der Schweiz mit grossem Interesse. Welche Bedeutung kommt dem Influencer-Marketing bei L'Oréal zu, und ist das in allen Ländern gleich? Als volumenmässig zweitgrösster Markt für Influencer-Werbung in Europa birgt Deutschland derzeit besonders viel Potenzial. Advocacy und die Zusammenarbeit mit Creators sind aber in allen drei Ländern eine wichtige Säule. Wir glauben, dass wir durch die Zusammenarbeit mit den richtigen Creators und die Nutzung ihrer authentischen Inhalte auf sozialen Medien die Wahrnehmung unserer Marken verändern können. Es ermöglicht uns ebenso, schnell auf Trends zu reagieren und unseren Content zu diversifizieren, um so eine relevante Kommunikation mit unseren Zielgruppen zu ermöglichen. Die Zahl unserer Influencer-Kooperationen hat sich innerhalb kurzer Zeit verdoppelt. Wir arbeiten mittlerweile bereits mit mehr als 2000 Influencern pro Jahr zusammen. Mit 37 Marken, von denen jede ihre eigenen Ziele, ihre eigene Tonalität und ihre eigene DNA hat, sind also effiziente Arbeitsmethoden, aber auch ein tiefes Verständnis der jeweiligen Markenidentität und der jeweiligen Zielgruppen erforderlich. Creator-Content ist auch zu einem essenziellen Teil unserer Media-Strategie gewachsen und gibt uns die Möglichkeit, unsere Creatives innerhalb der Kampagnen zu diversifizieren und authentische Werbebotschaften auf den jeweiligen sozialen Plattformen einzusetzen. Wir sehen in unseren Marketing-Mix-Studien, dass der gleichzeitige Einsatz von Marken-Content und Creator-Content sich positiv auf unseren ROI auswirkt. Was ist Ihnen in der Zusammenarbeit mit Influencern besonders wichtig? Welche KPIs sind entscheidend? Wir verfolgen einen ganzheitlichen Ansatz in Bezug auf die Reichweite unserer Influencer-Partner. Wir arbeiten mit der gesamten Influencer-Pyramide, von VIPs mit Millionen Followern bis hin zu Nano-Influencern mit kleineren, aber hochgradig engagierten Communitys. Jede dieser Gruppen spielt eine wichtige Rolle in unserer Marketingstrategie – von der Stärkung des Markenimages über die Steigerung der Conversions bis hin zur authentischen Ansprache von Nischenzielgruppen. Wir legen besonderen Wert auf den Aufbau und die Pflege engagierter Communitys, Interaktion und gegenseitiges Vertrauen, messbar durch KPIs wie die Engagement-Rate. Aus der Media-Perspektive gesprochen, bleiben für das Schaffen von Awareness die Reichweite und die Sichtbarkeit der Werbeanzeigen durch Creator-Content ein wichtiger KPI. Das Engagement erfolgt über die Relevanz des Contents. Welche Bedeutung haben für Sie in diesen Zeiten die klassischen Medien wie TV, Kino, OOH oder in die Presse? Klassische Medien bleiben ein wichtiger Bestandteil unseres Media-Mix. TV spielt weiterhin eine zentrale Rolle, wobei wir die Balance zwischen klassischen Buchungen und digitalen Streaming-Angeboten suchen. Gerade im Streaming-Bereich setzen wir verstärkt auf emotionales und kontextuell passendes Sponsoring, zum Beispiel die Kooperation von L'Oréal Paris mit «Emily in Paris» auf Netflix oder das La-Roche-Posay-Sponsoring von «Wimbledon» auf Prime Video. Solche exklusiven Platzierungen stärken langfristig unsere Marken. Aber auch lineares Fernsehen bietet nach wie vor reichweitenstarke Möglichkeiten für exklusive Integrationen, wie das erfolgreiche Sponsoring von «Bachelorette» in der Schweiz mit fast zwei Millionen Bruttokontakten zeigt. Out-of-Home wird durch digitale Optionen und Bewegtbild, insbesondere für Beauty, noch attraktiver. Wir setzen verstärkt auf innovative Formate wie 3D-Ads und sogenanntes Fake OOH. Durch Augmented Reality und CGI-Technologie schaffen wir beeindruckende Inszenierungen, die über Smartphones erlebbar sind und zusätzliche Reichweite in Social Media generieren. Gibt es Werbekreationen nur für die Schweiz, oder ist die Kreation für Ihre Brands meist für den DACH-Raum, europa- oder weltweit konzipiert? Unser Marketing-Mix kombiniert globale Stärke mit lokaler Relevanz....","SPR_COMBO[de]Frau Kamski, herzliche Gratulation zur Wahl in den SWA-Vorstand.

1m2aq5n,"  Hello! This is u/hendricks7 with this week's review of a popular book requested by the community. I apologize this is so long. I'm absolutely not angling to get paid work from these reviews. As a reminder, I'm not reviewing if I *liked* the book, but what I would say if one of my clients turned this in for a professional opinion. Let's get started! **Book Details:** **Title**: A Murder of Dragons and Books by Samantha A. Patrick **Series Name**: The Dragoon Series (Book 1). Sequel is due February 25^(th), 3074. **Page Count**: 1576 pages. **Publish Date:** April 1st, 2024 **Publisher**: Self Published ! [img](q9f5ambxdgdf1) **Publisher's Plot Description:** ""As an part time detective for Cabot Cove, Maine, ~~Raeve~~ Jessica's job is to complete orders and never get caught. When a kraken with a doctorate turns her world upside down, blood spills, hearts break, and ~~Raeve~~ Jess finds herself embroiled in a plot that will turn the residents of Cabot Cove against one another With rumors of a serial killer sweeping the town, Jessica's boss—the dragon shifter Sheriff—locks down the streets and surrounds her with guards. Isolated and restless, she turns to ~~Kingfisher~~ Sam, an old crush now acting as her kraken-shifter bodyguard. But as the killer draws closer, Sam starts to feel more like a warden than a protector. **My Means of Reading:** Kindle Paperwhite (Kindle Unlimited Version) **Fantasy Style:** Urban Fantasy **Review TLDR:** I know this is a beloved story for many, but the number of times we're reminded about dragons without seeing them is outrageous. I did enjoy that Jessica is an older FMC and not 18. What a breath of fresh aer! Readers should go in with the expectation of needing to turn off their critical thinking skills to fully enjoy the author's work. Thankfully, it's been out a while and is available on KU for those who already have that available. **Overall:** “A Murder of Dragons and Books” in the first half is clearly trying to be a thoughtful, fantastical expose on authoritarianism, wolf hierarchy, and how those with friends in the sheriff's office can fight crime. It fails at all three. The main character acts with a maturity well above her age and profession, the writing/editing are poor, and the world building is nonexistent. With all of this, it shouldn't be an interesting read…and yet it is. Patrick clearly understands the landscape of Maine and it's many serial killers, she just doesn't know how to create an FMC who understands that fixing it isn't as simple as solving crimes and sexing up her kraken lover. **Spice Level**: 4/5 – open door, explicit. Lots of details. The romance doesn't feel shoe-horned in and it feels very meaningful from the MMC's point of view. I really enjoyed that we got to experience it from Dr Sam Kraken's head. He is very thoughtful and intuitive with his 3 dicks and their varying sizes and enjoys Jessica's pleasure, as well as his own. **Pacing/Filler:** This book is not an action thriller, by any means, and there are some sections that could use a little trimming (Jessica tends to wax philosophical about Sam's finer sexual traits, which gets a little repetitive), but the pacing is consistent overall. It's a steady book from beginning to end, with moments of action interspersed with ~~court drama~~ intense criminal profiling and slice of life scenes. It's a very long book, and it could have been trimmed down to a short story. **Character Development:** The FMC begins the book with the personality of a formal school teacher who has learned about love and doesn't really change that aspect much either, even as she experiences new things. She is very resourceful and smart. She notices clues that everyone else misses, such as the werewolf pack who's moved into town. ~~Saeris~~ Jessica does grow slightly in that she does decide to stop trying to get everyone believe her and just solves the crimes herself. The MMC also seems pretty straightforward, as his motivations are glaringly obvious from even the blurb Amazon gives us – she's his long-lost love and the big, bad, kraken with a heart of gold that needs no development, I guess? As for the side characters, there is little to say. I do want to point out that the sheriff is a bumbling dragon shifter and it the sort of idiot who calls ~~Raeve~~  Jessica while she's actively interviewing someone – calls that let the suspect know they are on to them. Former Sheriff Mort is a good character who just wants to be helpful while not stepping on any toes. Bee the message fox is adorable though and the MMC's little sister (despite being the embodiment of the “little sister that needs protecting” trope) is fun when she shows a personality that doesn't feel like a “copy + paste” of ~~Saeris's~~ Jessica's. **World building:** This world is pretty stereotypical: bad murderer, worse townspeople, dragons bumbling around trying to solve crimes while fishing....","Hello!

Mo was reviewing the final terms when shadows began gathering near one of the hall's windows—not the casual darkness of approaching evening, but the deliberate, purposeful gloom that announced a temporary portal. A Shadow Moth materialized a few moments later, its obsidian wings seemingly sucking in all the surrounding light. The temperature dropped noticeably as reality rippled around its presence, and Emily's tablet flickered with static interference—technology struggling to interact with the consequence of the arcane activities. Unlike the casual confidence of her ravens, this creature carried itself with the rigid formality that screamed “Obscuris family tradition.” It dropped a silver message tube with geometric precision before dissolving back into shadow without so much as acknowledging the demons in the room. “Efficient,” Emily observed, still clutching her tablet, though the holographic displays had long since been switched off. “Do all interdimensional messengers have such dramatic timing?” Before Mo could answer, the temperature in the room plummeted. Frost began forming on the windows in intricate patterns that looked suspiciously like poetry written in crystalline script. An Ice Wraith flowed through the wall—literally through it, as if the stone were merely a suggestion—its translucent form shimmering between beautiful and terrifying. “The northern winds bring word from winter's heart,“ it whispered, its voice like wind through icicles. “Young Frostbrook sends assurance that the frozen peaks remain stable, though whispers of change echo through ancestral halls. “ The wraith placed a frosted tube beside the first message, then dissolved into vapor that somehow managed to bow respectfully before disappearing entirely. “Well,” Emily said faintly, “that was certainly more poetic than text messaging.” Mo broke the seals on both messages, scanning their contents quickly. Nyx's note was characteristically theatrical: Darling, I managed to convince the family that 'interdimensional crisis management' is a perfectly respectable career path for a black sheep of a child. Father still thinks I'm going through a phase, but Mother is intrigued by the possibilities. All stable here, for now. Though they're asking pointed questions about your 'demonic safety framework.' Yes, that's how I was able to spin it. And they are unhappy about the rumors related to the High Council. You know what. I think they just need a small push to join your project. Do try not to destabilize reality further before we return to school. XOXO, Nyx Lucian's message was more formal but equally reassuring: Mo, the Frostbrook estate remains secure, though my father has received concerning reports about widespread magical manifestations affecting 'lesser species.' I've assured him that your intervention capabilities extend beyond goblin rebellions. He's skeptical but willing to wait for evidence of your competence before deciding whether to demand High Council intervention. The ice gardens are particularly beautiful this season. I hope your negotiations proceed with wisdom and patience.

We might have less time than we thought.” Lord Crowe, who had been observing the messenger exchange with the detached interest of someone accustomed to interdimensional politics, cleared his throat. “Before you depart, Lady Nightshade, there is one additional matter we should discuss.” Mo felt her Dark Lady's sharp smile freeze in place.

1m2n63m,"  Hi, I was wondering, do you think Apollo's being the first olympian Melinoe encounters is going to have any relevance ? In the first game, meeting Athena was sort of meaningful, a respected and well known Olympian, who acts as a sort of mentor always encouraging us, also close to Nyx. In Hades 2, Apollo is the first olympian we meet, although I don't find real connexion with Melinoe, he's the cool, young guy, a Melinoe's buddylike, but that's all. A better replacement would have been Artemis, but Supergiant chose to make her a NPC (and I'm totally fine with it). While Zagreus and Athena were like siblings in arms, I struggle to see any development in Apollo and Melinoe's relationship. Another olympian who would have been perfect for being the very first encounter is Hera. Queen, goddess, magician, highly esteemed by Melinoe, the game clearly shows us that Hera mourns NOT having a talented and strong daughter. So what do you guys think ? I know the major plot is missing, but it seems to me the only reason they put Apollo as the first god encounter is that he was missing in Hades 1 and highly requested by the community, so they made things right in Hades 2.","Hi, I was wondering, do you think Apollo's being the first olympian Melinoe encounters is going to have any relevance ?

n3rbcb4,"  I'm going to preface this by saying I'm writing this before bed so I'm hoping it makes sense but uh here's my 2 cents on their relationship: While I agree Nyx and Ethan didn't interact romantically I do think they had good chemistry and they interacted in general alot during the game. For every major story point it's always Nyx, Ethan and Olympia together. They're the main characters after all. There are only 3 major points when Nyx and Ethan aren't together. During their argument in the third stratum (which was quickly resolved), the porcelain cave scene and when Nyx went after Kitt in the 5th stratum. They do have some touching moments together. The graveyard scene where Nyx says it's nice to hear Ethan speak his thoughts since he isn't very outgoing. Ethan saying he trusts Nyx despite learning she's an abyssal in the underground city (yknow the people who killed the mother he misses dearly). The part in the 5th stratum where Nyx cheers Ethan up after he says he feels like a failure for not being able to prevent his mother's death or Aimee's capture. With everything they go through it's only natural Nyx and Ethan would have a lot of trust in each other and become close by the end of the game. I mean at this point Ethan/Olympia keep reiterating they'll keep doing things together as they always have. The main issue is while it's realistic for them to end up together the game doesnt lean into the romantic side until the true ending when suddenly time skips to marriage. Other than the implied crush Ethan has in the post game. So I understand why people are thrown off by them getting together at the end. I personally wasn't too bothered by the jump and I do like them being together. However I've also been shipping characters for a long time so im used to having to fill in gaps. I just kinda fill in where I think the romantic moments would happen during the story and have fun with it","I'm going to preface this by saying I'm writing this before bed so I'm hoping it makes sense but uh here's my 2 cents on their relationship: While I agree Nyx and Ethan didn't interact romantically I do think they had good chemistry and they interacted in general alot during the game.

n3rl4px,"  Yeah, we named our Harley after Harley Quinn too and a few people have given us nasty comments. But I really try to think through my kids names and kinda give options if they decide they don't love their first names. That's why we decided against Harley Quinn fly out,cuz maybe she wouldnt like the character and would think it was dumb lol (Spoiler: She's 13 now and LOVES her name and has cosplayed Harley Quinn and even had. Super Hero Girls themed birthday for her...5th birthday party, I believe. Gave us the super fun excuse to dress and decorate with awesome DC ladies! But her names are Harley Rose Marie (Last Name). I love flowers and flower names and my first miscarriage was a daughter we were gonna name Lilith/Lily so I liked passing down the flower and nature names. And it also gave a feminine contrast to the unisex name Harley. Marie, as overused as it is, is a family name...mine, my mom's, my grandmother's, and my great-grandmother. And especially since my mom died unexpectedly when I was 18 and never got to meet any of her grandkids, it felt right to pass that piece down. So if she wsnt into Harley so much (esp because shwas born before Suicide Squad and any of Harley Quinn's story really got much attention by the public), She could have gone by Rose, Rose Marie, Marie, etc. M then I never meant intended to give my kids matchy names but 7 years after Harley was born, Haven wasn't even on my list but I couldn't stop thinking about that name. And my husband loved it too. And we are both Stephen King fans and he has multiple stories and even a TV series that was on the Sy-Fy channel back in the day based on the town of Haven and the for middle names we wanted to use another family name but he has 2 sisters and I couldn't pick just one... so we tried to combine their names until we got AnnaLynn from his younger sister ChristiANNA Nicole and his twin sister, Jessica LYNN. With number 3, we were actually pretty set on the name Piper. But my husband kept saying since the first 2 have H names, maybe we should just give her one too so she doesn't feel left out lol. So he had a great grandmother named Hazel and for some reason, even though it's old-fashioned, I think it's pretty and I liked the nature aspect of the Hazel tree and hazelnuts (hazelnutcoffee, Nutella hazelnut spread....yummm hahah). So she's Hazel Selene (Selene being the moon goddess...I'm a mythology nerd and have always been very drawn to the moon, the night sky, and space. I love the goddesses Selene, Nyx, Morrigan, Freya, Calliope, etc but didn't wanna steer too ""weird""). And yes, I call her Hazelnut haha. And then we thought we were done but got a surprise number 4! At that point, I was like ""Okay, the only H names I can think of at this point are Harlow and Harper. And Harlow is too similar sounding to Harley. As if all the H names didn't get crazy confusing at times haha. So Harper, it was. I think it's classic and sounds beautiful. Music is another HUGE passion my husband and I share, so she got music, flower, and some bonus nature in her name... Harper Violet Sage. Plus ""sage"", just makes me think of peace, wisdom, beautiful greenery, and I feel like it fits her personality so beautifully so well. She's an old soul like me and her oldest sister. I  feel incredibly blessed to have my daughters after a lot of loss and struggle. But thank you for the compliments as well. I name my kids based on what I feel fits them and can evolve throughout life, but obviously, you can never make everyone happy.

n3rvcmp,"  I once shat out a crack theory from when I thought the Fatui were more cloesly aligned with the abyss, due to Childe having trained there, ofc we know now the Fatui had nothing to do with it, but regardless: So the Tsaritsa (our beloved Bronya) is said to be the Archon of Love right, however she has grown cold and spiteful towards Celestia and no longer does she feel that love. And why could that be? Because Seele was cursed or killed during the Cataclysm, a solid motivation for the Tsaritsa to go down the route she did. But again, based off of my thought that the Fatui and Abyss were allies, I thought that Seele could maybe have been taken in and protected/preserved as a favour to the Tsaritsa, by a theoretical Queen of the Abyss: Veliona My memory is fuzzy on this particular aspect of the theory, but this was around Enkanomiya times when we were getting a lot of lore dropped on us, and it got me looking into related greek mythology which funnily enough led me to finding Aether's name mentioned, and a closely related name within this family tree was Nyx, the goddess of death. Hi3 players may know one of Veliona's battlesuits as Starchasm Nyx, so that got me thinking about this scenario of her being the Queen of the Abyss While this theory is ofc null and void from the information we're working with now, I still like the idea of a tragic story between the Tsaritsa and our theoretical Seele, and I would love to see Veliona too, especially as an Abyssal entity. Ronova being the Shade of Death and ofc not being Seele has rendered that potential path null too, so I do wonder what route they could take if they wanted to retain the Death themes of Hi3 Seele/Veliona, or if they go a different route entirely like HSR did. Praying they go for the more fantastical elements of Seele, but I'm not fussy as long as I get to see the best girls do their thing in the Genshin universe and at least one version of each is playable","I once shat out a crack theory from when I thought the Fatui were more cloesly aligned with the abyss, due to Childe having trained there, ofc we know now the Fatui had nothing to do with it, but regardless: So the Tsaritsa (our beloved Bronya) is said to be the Archon of Love right, however she has grown cold and spiteful towards Celestia and no longer does she feel that love.

mov_CDE1D311FBE394FAA4275BEB2FC22372,"  7 Beauty Products I Can't Survive Summer Without (Seriously, Take My Wallet) I really appreciate you checking out my blog! Just so you know, some of the links in this post are affiliate links. This means that if you buy something through them, I might earn a little bit of money, at no extra cost to you. There's absolutely no pressure to buy anything, but if you do, it genuinely helps support the time and love I put into writing these posts. Summer and I have a complicated relationship. I love the sunshine, the pool days, the iced coffees, and pretending I live in a Pinterest picnic. But I hate how my skin goes into oil factory mode, my makeup melts off faster than my motivation, and my hair turns into a fuzzball that could rival a lion's mane. Over the years, I've tried dozens of beauty products promising to “beat the heat,” but most of them let me down—like that one friend who always cancels last minute. So after way too much trial and error, I've found my ride-or-dies: 7 beauty products I literally cannot live without during the summer months. They're affordable, all on Amazon (because yes, I'm a Prime-addicted human), and they actually do what they claim. Let's get into it. 1. e.l.f. Power Grip Primer Buy on Amazon → Let me start by saying: this stuff is glue. In the best way possible. I used to skip primer because I thought it was a scam. But once summer hits and my foundation starts sliding off like it's auditioning for Cirque du Soleil, I need something to holdit together. This primer grips my makeup like it's its job (because it is) and gives me that smooth, hydrated finish without being greasy. Bonus: It feels just like a dupe for that expensive Milk Makeup one… but it's like $10. Win-win. 2. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Hyaluronic Acid Buy on Amazon → My skin gets confused in the summer. It's dry in patches, oily in others, and occasionally acts like it's mad at me for drinking iced coffee instead of water. This gel moisturizer saved me. It's light, cooling, and soaks in like a dream without leaving a film. I use it morning and night—and sometimes right after I come in from the heat, just to feel something soothing. It feels like giving my skin a tall glass of water. No breakouts, no sticky residue, just happy, bouncy skin. 3. NYX Bare With Me Concealer Serum Buy on Amazon → Foundation in the summer? No thank you. I'm not trying to bake a cake on my face. Instead, I've been living for this lightweight concealer serum. It's buildable, blends like a dream, and looks like skin—not like a mask. I use it under my eyes, around my nose, and on any little blemish trying to ruin my day. It doesn't crease, doesn't melt, and somehow makes me look like I actually slept last night. Which, spoiler: I didn't. 4. Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant Buy on Amazon → Let's talk clogged pores. Summer means sweat, sunscreen, and leftover makeup—and all that stuff loves to hang out in my pores like uninvited guests. I started using this exfoliant a few nights a week and noticed a huge difference. My skin looks smoother, my breakouts are way less intense, and those weird little bumps on my forehead? Gone. It's a holy grail product for a reason. Just make sure you wear sunscreen during the day (but you're already doing that, right? RIGHT?) . 5. Pacifica Underarm Deodorant Wipes Buy on Amazon → Okay, hear me out: I never thought I needed deodorant wipes… until I did. One day I was running late to a brunch, totally forgot deodorant, and grabbed one of these from my glove box out of desperation. Life....","7 Beauty Products I Can't Survive Summer Without (Seriously, Take My Wallet) I really appreciate you checking out my blog! Just so you know, some of the links in this post are affiliate links. This means that if you buy something through them, I might earn a little bit of money, at no extra cost to you. There's absolutely no pressure to buy anything, but if you do, it genuinely helps support the time and love I put into writing these posts. Summer and I have a complicated relationship. I love the sunshine, the pool days, the iced coffees, and pretending I live in a Pinterest picnic. But I hate how my skin goes into oil factory mode, my makeup melts off faster than my motivation, and my hair turns into a fuzzball that could rival a lion's mane. Over the years, I've tried dozens of beauty products promising to “beat the heat,” but most of them let me down—like that one friend who always cancels last minute. So after way too much trial and error, I've found my ride-or-dies: 7 beauty products I literally cannot live without during the summer months. They're affordable, all on Amazon (because yes, I'm a Prime-addicted human), and they actually do what they claim. Let's get into it. 1. e.l.f. Power Grip Primer Buy on Amazon → Let me start by saying: this stuff is glue. In the best way possible. I used to skip primer because I thought it was a scam. But once summer hits and my foundation starts sliding off like it's auditioning for Cirque du Soleil, I need something to holdit together. This primer grips my makeup like it's its job (because it is) and gives me that smooth, hydrated finish without being greasy. Bonus: It feels just like a dupe for that expensive Milk Makeup one… but it's like $10. Win-win. 2. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Hyaluronic Acid Buy on Amazon → My skin gets confused in the summer. It's dry in patches, oily in others, and occasionally acts like it's mad at me for drinking iced coffee instead of water. This gel moisturizer saved me.

mov_D7177EDC87D30678CFC88808773DD4C0,"  Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey is one of those beloved, once-in-a-generation beauty sensations that seem impossible to replicate. The iconic lipstick was first launched in 1989 and quickly became a Gen X makeup mainstay with legions of devoted fans (including '90s-era Drew Barrymore). In fact, even today, one tube is sold every three minutes, according to Clinique. What makes the Black Honey shade so special? The formula is universally flattering, specially designed out of a blend of blue, red and yellow pigments, so it works for any and all skin tones. As it turns out, there are even more options for Black Honey devotees: Clinique now offers a Pop Lip + Cheek Oil in Black Honey. The internet — and the Gen X crowd in my over-50 group chat — are both currently obsessed. Clinique This tinted oil is ultra-versatile (use it on lips, cheeks or anywhere you want a hint of color) and leaves your skin looking dewy and just a bit flushed. It's also allergy-tested, fragrance-free and safe for all skin types. $27 at Macy's ""YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS,"" one friend emphatically texted. ""I think it's even better than the lipstick!!!"" another enthusiastic pal chimed in. The Pop Lip + Cheek Oil truly does live up to the hype. It's versatile, highly portable and easy to use. It's an oil, yes, but it doesn't migrate the way some products with this type of texture will. The dewy finish is pretty and glowy and especially good for older, drier skin. As a blush, it rivals Benefit's famous Benetint, except the formula here is less thin and unwieldy and you actually have a good deal of control over the pigment, which you can build. Best of all, like the lipstick, the Black Honey oil looks dark in the tube but, once on, works like a customized tint, lightly staining cheeks and lips the most natural-looking cherry hue that's just a hint or two above bare. The application itself couldn't be more foolproof — you dab on a little of the product with the handy sponge applicator and blend it in with your fingers. It leaves your skin looking subtly flushed, like you've been outside exerting yourself in the freshest air, not scowling at a screen all day. All of which is to say, the group chat was right: This is one of my favorite products I've tested all year. If, however, $27 feels a little steep for something you swoop on your cheeks, I've also tracked down a few solid and more affordable Black Honey swaps for this new tinted oil. Amazon Elf's tinted oil is more pigmented than the Clinique version and stays on a bit longer too. The texture is slightly stickier, but worth the close to 60% savings in cost. Sure, it's not esigned for cheeks, but it's versatile enough to be used that way. Makeup rules were made to be broken! I won't tell if you won't. $8 at Amazon Amazon NYX's deep berry shade is similar to Black Honey, if a teensy bit rosier. Like the Elf, it's more pigmented and stays on longer too. Reviewers do find it more gloss than cheek oil, and the consistency is on the stickier side. $9 at Macy's If you have Amazon Prime, you'll get free shipping, of course. Not yet a member? No problem. You can sign up for your free 30-day trial here.

It was both a success and a failure. The success was that after Huby founded The Exploration Company in Europe, she managed to move nimbly with the “Mission Possible” spacecraft such that it cost less than $25 million to build and reached space in less than three years. The vehicle ticked off a number of successes in spaceflight before making a controlled descent through the atmosphere. But at 26 km above the planet, as the spacecraft slowed to Mach one, The Exploration Company lost contact. Huby was not sure how this loss would be received in Europe, where failures in spaceflight have not been traditionally well-tolerated. “What was interesting is the feedback I got in Europe,” Huby said in an interview this week at the company's offices in Houston. “The German Space Agency, the French space agency, the European Space Agency said, OK, that's a great achievement. For the time and money we spent, performing 80 percent of that mission was a good investment.” No drop tests After the spacecraft was lost on June 24, the company established an independent investigation team. Huby said it is “99 percent” confirmed there was a problem with the deployment of the parachutes, either the drogue chutes or the main parachutes. The fault was not with the provider of the parachutes themselves, US-based Airborne Systems, but the company's mechanism, she said. To save time and money, The Exploration Company did not conduct any drop tests. Such a campaign would have added millions of dollars to a program that was trying to be lean, plus a year of schedule to a mission attempting to move fast. “We made a mistake, basically, to underestimate the risks,” she said. In retrospect, Huby added, the company could have done more testing on the ground. Now the firm faces a big decision: How to proceed from here. One option is building another small spacecraft, similar to Mission Possible, for testing purposes. But there is limited commonality in the parachute system for this vehicle and the larger Nyx spacecraft the company is building for operational missions. So if the Mission Possible parachutes were to work, that would not guarantee success for Nyx.

mov_EA6504D44E24E0F331703308A00FDF4D,"  ritten by Aiden Nel, BA Classical History and Psychology, MA Classical History According to Greek mythology, when the cosmos was created, it was initially inhabited by the first generation of beings known as the Primordial gods or Protogenoi (Firstborn). Many of these gods appeared fully formed at the moment of the cosmos's creation. They personified the fundamental elements and natural forces shaping the universe's development. Through various unions and betrayals, the Protogenoi set the stage for the next generation of cosmic rulers: the Titans and the Olympians. Read on to learn more about the first generation of primordial gods, the Protogenoi. What Were the Primordial Gods? The Untangling of Chaos, by Hendrik Goltzius, 1589. Source: Los Angeles County Museum of Art The earliest references to the Protogenoi are in Hesiod's epic poem Theogony, composed between 750 and 650 BCE. Hesiod's Theogony outlines the origins and genealogies of the gods, beginning with the creation of the cosmos and the primordial deities and culminating with the Olympian gods. The names, functions, and characteristics of the primordials established by Hesiod have influenced the popular understanding of these ancient beings. Over the centuries, other Greek theogonies have introduced new members and added details and functions to this original generation of gods. Unlike the later generations of divinities in Greek mythology, the primordials were typically not depicted with human forms or characteristics. Instead, they personified fundamental natural forces that shaped the cosmos and established essential natural systems. They embodied concepts such as the Earth, the Sky, the Sea, the Air, and Night and Day, among other ideas. While the primordials represented the natural world, they possessed minds of their own, with many exhibiting unique personalities, ambitions, and flaws. Chaos, the Vast Chasm Chaos, by George Frederic Watts and Assistants, 1875. Source: Wikimedia Commons At first, there was Chaos. Primordial Chaos was the first being to exist when the cosmos was created. In Hesiod's original description, the exact nature of Chaos is somewhat ambiguous. While many interpret Chaos as female, unlike other primordial beings, Hesiod does not specify a gender for Chaos. Chaos is likely a formless, nongendered entity. Unlike the contemporary understanding of chaos, primordial Chaos is often regarded as a vast void, abyss, or chasm that serves as a space or canvas for the universe to unfold upon. Chaos is usually described as the vast, endless void, but Hesiod also vaguely places it beneath the earth, above the pit of Tartarus. Hesiod's depiction of this formless and mysterious Chaos was later reimagined by others, particularly in the epic poem Metamorphoses by the 1st-century Roman poet Ovid. In this new interpretation, Chaos existed before the creation of the cosmos and combined all the elements that make up the universe. Ovid describes Chaos as an undeveloped mass that contains all the confused and discordant elements in one large, unruly heap. From this primordial “soup,” everything else would emerge. Chaos is often understood as the atmospheric or lower air filling the great void. This interpretation holds some significance, as this formless deity would eventually asexually give birth to two primordial children: Nyx and Erebus. Together, they would sire the primordial upper air deity, Aether. Gaia, the Goddess of the Earth Gaea, by Anselm Feuerbach, 1875. Source: Central Institute for Art History The second primordial entity to emerge after Chaos was Gaia, the personification of the Earth and the first mother. Gaia was revered as the primordial goddess of fertility, and often considered the titular Mother Earth who presided over the creation of life in all its forms. She is frequently depicted as a matronly woman from the torso up, rising from the earth she embodies. Gaia's deep connection to the earth she embodied led to her strong association with the Chthonic deities of the underworld, and she was often worshiped alongside fertility deities such as Persephone and Demeter. She became the mother of the next generation of primordial beings, asexually giving birth to Uranus, her husband and the first supreme ruler of the cosmos, and the Ourea and Pontus. Additionally, with Uranus as her consort, Gaia gave birth to many well-known figures in Greek mythology, including the first generation of Titans, Cyclopes, and Hecatoncheires (the Hundred-Handers). Gaia, by Otto Greiner, 1912. Source: Wikimedia Commons Gaia plays a significant role in Greek mythology. When her husband Uranus imprisoned their sons, the Hecatoncheires and the Cyclopes, out of fear that they would usurp him, she sought revenge by devising a plan with Kronos to castrate and overthrow him. When Uranus's blood fell on the earth, Gaia birthed the Erinyes, the Giants, and the Meliae nymphs. Kronos proved as tyrannical as his father. Kronos swallowed his first five children with his sister Rhea to avoid being overthrown....","ritten by Aiden Nel, BA Classical History and Psychology, MA Classical History According to Greek mythology, when the cosmos was created, it was initially inhabited by the first generation of beings known as the Primordial gods or Protogenoi (Firstborn). Many of these gods appeared fully formed at the moment of the cosmos's creation. They personified the fundamental elements and natural forces shaping the universe's development. Through various unions and betrayals, the Protogenoi set the stage for the next generation of cosmic rulers: the Titans and the Olympians. Read on to learn more about the first generation of primordial gods, the Protogenoi. What Were the Primordial Gods? The Untangling of Chaos, by Hendrik Goltzius, 1589. Source: Los Angeles County Museum of Art The earliest references to the Protogenoi are in Hesiod's epic poem Theogony, composed between 750 and 650 BCE. Hesiod's Theogony outlines the origins and genealogies of the gods, beginning with the creation of the cosmos and the primordial deities and culminating with the Olympian gods. The names, functions, and characteristics of the primordials established by Hesiod have influenced the popular understanding of these ancient beings. Over the centuries, other Greek theogonies have introduced new members and added details and functions to this original generation of gods. Unlike the later generations of divinities in Greek mythology, the primordials were typically not depicted with human forms or characteristics.

1m3kn3v,"  Hi! I'm super new to Reddit so if I get anything wrong about the structure or wtv is super sorry. I kinda just made this account to rant. So, I'm starting to hate my sister. I'm a teen (not gonna specify since I've heard abt some weirdos on here sorry 😓) and my sister is in her mid-twenties. She lives at home with me, my brother, mother, and father, which I understand since houses / apartments aren't super affordable. Anyway, I think I'm starting to develop hatred for her because she, and my parents, insert her into everything. When I try to show something to my mom, she always has to see. When I try to share an opinion or an interest with my dad, she always makes a comment on it. It's so SO annoying istg. It's like having a parrot hovering over you and making a comment about everything you say. The other day I was doing the dishes as she was in the kitchen and I accidentally flung a plastic spatula on the floor and she goes, “Did you mean to throw that? 🤓” … like obviously not? My hands r slippery dude, why would you ask that?? Use your brain I'm begging you……. . AND earlier this year I was redecorating and repainting my room, so all of my furniture and posters or whatever are in the hall, my sister pops her head in and says, “Looks pretty bland to me!” . Like buddy…. I'm legit painting it. Ofc it's bland my DECORATION isn't in here 😭. And the other day I was telling my mom a story of something I saw on the news and REPEATEDLY she tried to cut in. Like let me finish my story and you can tell me whatever you want. Ugh it jst makes me so angry I can't. Anyway, today I was talking with my mom about how I wanted to get matching tattoos with her since me and my mom are pretty close, and she hinted at getting matching tattoos with my sister and I. She doesn't need to be included in everything. She's a grown woman that won't throw a tantrum about not being included. Last Halloween me and my friend were trick-or-treating as an excuse to hang out, and she legit told us she would go so she could keep an eye on us… like dude I can walk around by myself. But Ykw, maybe she just wanted to keep me safe, I get that. Thing is, she treats me like I'm a little kid. Maybe it's because she's the eldest and I'm the youngest, but seriously, she needs to learn I've grown up. Speaking of grown up, it seems like she never LEARNED how to grow up. She LOVES MHA, Harry Potter, Nightmare before Christmas, Spy X Family, Dream light valley, D&D, and legit anything Disney. No hate if you like those things, I like some anime's and Nightmare before Christmas is a really cute movie, but I know when and who to bring it up to. I don't explain the entire lore of JJK to my parents or people who don't like the show, but it's like she doesn't care. I've heard her talk about MHA so much to my parents at even the SLIGHTEST mention of it. She's also like the pickiest eater EVER. She barely likes ANY fruits or vegetables, strictly orders Quesadillas at ANY Mexican restaurant we go to, shoots down my attempts to ask my parents for Chipotle, and always drinks coffee. I don't remember the last time I've seen her drink water. Again no hate if you're also a picky eater, I'm a bit picky, too, but omg it's such a hassle for my parents to work around. Anyway during dinner my family likes to eat and watch TV, and when I'm finished with my meal my cat always jumps on my lap (Her name is S'mores btw isn't that the cutest?? She's a Calico) and my sister always leans over the mountain of pillows and annoys her. Today S'mores bit her, cause she was annoyed ofc, and my sister STILL continues to pet her. Like leave her alone she obviously doesn't want to be pet?? And one of my dogs (Nyx, she's pretty young maybe 2 years old) likes to chew up napkins. Which isn't a problem, but it's the fact that she makes a big, ripped up napkin mess all over the carpet. My sister has the bright idea to GIVE her the napkin and doesn't even OFFER let alone CLEAN UP the mess. She NEVER feeds the dogs / cats, and rarely ever takes them out. She's literally been coddled from birth. In fact, my mom is forcing me to get my driving permit not matter how scared I am (which I'm actually pretty grateful for ty mom) because she doesn't want me to end up like my sister....","Hi!

Buttermelt NYX professional makeup: brillo ligero por 11 euros en Amazon El secreto de las melenas perfectas cuesta solo 10 euros en Amazon: Olaplex no. 6 El sérum más viral de Garnier por 7 euros en Amazon: vitamina c y piel perfecta Además, al no tener consistencia líquida, se evita el desperdicio de producto, lo cual lo vuelve mucho más rendidor que otros formatos. Una pequeña cantidad basta para eliminar el esmalte de ambas manos sin esfuerzo. Otro de sus puntos fuertes es su formato compacto y seguro, ideal para llevar en la maleta o bolso de mano. No necesitas algodones ni papel aluminio: con una espátula o brocha puedes aplicarlo directamente y ver cómo el esmalte comienza a romperse casi al instante. Por solo 8 euros, tienes en tus manos un producto de nivel profesional, con resultados inmediatos, una fórmula pensada para el cuidado de las uñas y con cientos de reseñas positivas en Amazon que avalan su efectividad. Si buscas una alternativa fácil, económica y menos agresiva para retirar esmalte —incluyendo los más difíciles—, es, sin duda, tu mejor aliado.",2025-07-19 05:04:29,es,WEB,,mundistyle,,,1,False,False,"Although the comment mentions NYX Professional Makeup briefly at the end, the majority of the text is about a nail polish remover by Jodsone and does not provide meaningful content related to NYX makeup products or brand experiences.",Medium,1.5522494316101074,False

Peach Slices Redness Relief Color Correcting Cream for those days when your skin seems to be pitching a fit about one thing or another. This not only provides soothing, moisturizing ingredients like aloe and green algae, but it also has a subtle color-correcting tint that tones down redness. Think of it as a little tube of damage control for when your skin needs extra TLC. Promising review: ""I'm not one to normally leave reviews, but this is worth it. I've literally had this product for two days. I have severe rosacea on my nose. It's so bad I usually have to wear foundation to hide it because it's so noticeable. I've tried numerous products and serums with no luck, and honestly, I didn't expect this one to be any different. However, after only two days (probably applying it 4–5 times), almost all of the redness is gone! I'm in disbelief at the wonders it has done. I will without a doubt be stocking up on this product!"" —Tiffany Price: $19.88 2. Neutrogena Collagen Bank Facial Moisturizer that's basically an investment in your future face. Collagen can help keep things pinchably plump, bouncy, and glowy, which is great.

No joke, this study suggests that bakuchiol is just as effective as retinol while being way less likely to cause irritation. So basically, you get all the glow with none of the drama. It's a win-win.

With a powerhouse blend of shea butter, beeswax, vitamin E, and chamomile, this ultra-soothing balm helps restore moisture, calms irritation, and keeps flakes at bay.

After the cliffhanger of Nemesis, I knew WARRIOR would be a wild, crazy ride and I wasn't wrong. Artemis ""Tem"" is really put through the wringer in this book; my heart broke for her. Gabriel may have suffered a traumatic past, but what he inflicts upon Tem is nothing more than abuse, unforgivable and heinous. Reese always seems to have Ten's back, but there is also something about him that doesn't ring true, he's hiding something. Saint is still my favourite, even though he does mess up, he genuinely cares for Tem, but will he ever let go of Nyx? Finally there's Kade, I'm still not sure about him, he has way too many secrets and appears to be playing on both sides, for how much longer though? This group of four are on a tumultuous ride, will they all survive? WARRIOR is a gripping and suspenseful read, and Ms. Massery continues to keep them going right through to that jaw dropping, emotional cliffhanger.

n3zp2hn,"  Move 2 (fragmentation): Nyx laughs and disappears. In his place are 5 shadowy clones that immediately dash in different directions slashing if they hit a target dealing 13% damage. Once all 5 disappear Nyx appears and snaps his fingers causing all hit enemies to be pulled to him who kicks them forwards for 7% and then slams his hands into the ground causing glitchy black spikes to burst up dealing 24% while ragdolling hit enemies. Can hit ragdolled, unblockable, unevasible. Move 3 (Dissension): Nyx throws his hands back charging for a second before summoning his console infront of him. He then forces his hand up making the floor infront of him rise up into the sky. If an enemy is hit and they were ragdolled, they take 8% damage and Nyx is teleported up with the enemy onto the platform. As the enemy stands up Nyx summons abunch of other panels and begins a cutscene where the enemy and player begin to fight on the small platform. Uhm great I gotta choreograph this I guess. Nyx jumps forwards and attempts to slash the enemy who quickly blocks and pushes Nyx away. I'm too lazy actually. Imagine a cool cutscene where the player and enemy trade blows while Nyx throws in some random studs and blocks to try and push the player off. The cutscene ends as Nyx jumps forwards and does another slash as the enemy blocks but this time they get overpowered and pushed off the platform. Nyx takes the chance and jumps off to stabbing his blade into the enemy's chest, impaling them as the enemy smashes into the ground causing a massive explosion. Nyx takes the sword out and the enemy takes 85% damage. However, if the enemy was not ragdolled a different cutscene plays. The enemy is instead just sent flying up and tries to regain their balance mid air. The platform quickly retreats into the ground but Nyx appears and punches the enemy with a code infused fist sending them away into more pillars that they bounce off of. This time it's like 5 or 6. At the end instead of just a slash down Nyx is flying there to meet the enemy grabbing them and throwing them downwards towards the floor where he does a slash from left to right with his blade, then a slash up, then he runs around to the other side of the enemy for a back slash and then he finally does one finally slash that sends the enemy flying off. Deals 55% damage. Move 4 (Codex slash): Nyx does a long runup before doing a single large slash. The slash takes a long time to start so it's hard to land. Upon hitting, the enemy falls to the floor gaining a strange rift like surface on them. Nyx jumps in through the enemy's wound and starts to randomly rip and destroy random pieces of code circling them before swimming up through the code. Nyx then finally sees a massive ball connected to all the other pieces and gets his console out using a command called destabilize which turns the core red and destabilizes the things holding it down. Nyx rips out a final chunk of core code (looks like their avatar's mesh ID or animation script), then crushes it. A cascade of glitched data bursts from the enemy's body like static particles, and their idle animation breaks completely for a few seconds. The enemy then dies instantly while their screen displays a fake sign where their account was terminated. Passives: (Infection): all M1s leave a 1 second lingering hitbox. (Remember?) : every time Nyx hits the enemy, the timer for this is extended by 10 seconds. Randomly, notifications appear around the enemy's screen with various messages. They are the following: “Friends not found.” “You were at the party right?” “Nyx is typing…” “remember nyx? the party guy?” “he used to host the BEST parties” “…admin said he was unstoppable…” “last seen: Doomspire Brickbattle (3 years ago)” “user nyx0977 not found” “You left me behind…” “You said you'd wait.” “I was your best friend.” “I waited at the spawn.” “Everyone moved on but me.” “You forgot me.”...","Move 2 (fragmentation): Nyx laughs and disappears.

Bryaxis while labeled a monster doesnt seem to act like a malevolent malicious being. she seems to like females and not males so much. if she was indeed hungry she could have fed on the priestess's and then fed at will, since the war. thus far she's only killed after she was asked to both times by feyre (ravens/hybern ranks) when she makes the first bargain with feyre she asks for company someone to tell her of life and the second time sunlight moonlight stars. if she was truly bad she would have asked for like people to eat or sacrifices to be made in her name.

n441rhw,"  Well first off just making everything legible and organized is well done haha, I'll fight to keep in P1/2 since there's fun potential to have ""Arcana-specific Wild Cards"" as a class of characters If there's any areas that could be squeezed, I'd capitalize on combining slots for characters who share some ""dual nature"" -- in combat, maybe switching at certain bar-filling parameters or appearing during finishers? I'm talking Makoto/Kotone, Aigis/Metis, Akechi in either forms, perhaps Elizabeth could even have Theodore pop in lmao For that matter, I'm unsure how to expand ""Velvet Room Attendant"" play-styles beyond what Margaret already fills? Lavenza could have a fun chainsaw/iron-maiden approach or splitting into the twins, but potentially just having one out of [P3/P4/P5] might be enough... Something I'd consider is the grey-area of ""non-persona-user/divine entity"" for Ryoji and Marie (even Jose since he doesn't have ""attendant duties"" for handling Persona-fusing like the others yet). Is it considered an even playing-field to keep the slot? The potential is *amazing* and ideally I'd wanna keep 'em just to get creative with their powers, but a ""playable final boss"" is hard to pull off when Ryoji-without-amnesia is either poofed out of Gekkoukan for the month or dead after Nyx is sealed. (I guess it goes without saying, **any** story trying to incorporate 2 decades of characters is gonna be batshit insane and ridiculously long lmao) Leaving them out ties into potentially having one ""antagonist/villain"" slot per game; I agree Takaya and Adachi are the foremost Persona-using bosses of P3 and P4, so for P2 it miiiiight have to involve just Sudou? (Akari + Anna ur angels sorry😭) Which also brings to mind Kandori; *very* fun having someone across P1 and P2EP, it just brings the whole package of Nyarlathotep along with him...... . is that a ""Persona"" in the same sense? Kandori *probably* was a persona-user in P1, but if Jun/Joker was in a similar situation and Nyarly has his own agenda, it might escalate into too-strong of an entity to believably stay even-matched. I'm fighting to keep him in, since either we bring Snow Queen for the antagonist slot or somehow Maki(?) takes it?? But if I know *Persona* fans they take one look at ""scientist possessed by gold Lovecraft tentacle thing"" and go ""ok bootleg Maruki"" no matter how Royal's clearly a P1 loveletter (wait shit is Akechi the P5 antagonist-slot? I said earlier it makes sense to combine Robin Hood/Loki, but then you'd have to fill it with Maruki and that's too close to Kandori so aaaaaaa) Anyway haha for buyers I'd hate to do this, but some characters can also be DLC-relegated and namely the spinoff ones. Labrys + Sho, Sophie + Zenkichi, Toshiro (fighting with Erina), Wonder, Zen (with cameo support from Rei), Hikari (fighting with Doe I guess?) , and any others who might pop up.

The potential is *amazing* and ideally I'd wanna keep 'em just to get creative with their powers, but a ""playable final boss"" is hard to pull off when Ryoji-without-amnesia is either poofed out of Gekkoukan for the month or dead after Nyx is sealed. (I guess it goes without saying, **any** story trying to incorporate 2 decades of characters is gonna be batshit insane and ridiculously long lmao) Leaving them out ties into potentially having one ""antagonist/villain"" slot per game; I agree Takaya and Adachi are the foremost Persona-using bosses of P3 and P4, so for P2 it miiiiight have to involve just Sudou? (Akari + Anna ur angels sorry) Which also brings to mind Kandori; *very* fun having someone across P1 and P2EP, it just brings the whole package of Nyarlathotep along with him...... . is that a ""Persona"" in the same sense? Kandori *probably* was a persona-user in P1, but if Jun/Joker was in a similar situation and Nyarly has his own agenda, it might escalate into too-strong of an entity to believably stay even-matched. I'm fighting to keep him in, since either we bring Snow Queen for the antagonist slot or somehow Maki(?) takes it?? But if I know *Persona* fans they take one look at ""scientist possessed by gold Lovecraft tentacle thing"" and go ""ok bootleg Maruki"" no matter how Royal's clearly a P1 loveletter (wait shit is Akechi the P5 antagonist-slot? I said earlier it makes sense to combine Robin Hood/Loki, but then you'd have to fill it with Maruki and that's too close to Kandori so aaaaaaa) Anyway haha for buyers I'd hate to do this, but some characters can also be DLC-relegated and namely the spinoff ones. Labrys + Sho, Sophie + Zenkichi, Toshiro (fighting with Erina), Wonder, Zen (with cameo support from Rei), Hikari (fighting with Doe I guess?) , and any others who might pop up.

Eight matches have been announced for the show, which will take place on Sunday. The action will emanate from the UBS Arena. Mike Santana will hope to cap off his homecoming with a TNA World Championship win. To do so, he'll need to get past titleholder Trick Williams and Joe Hendry in a three-way match. WWE will have a presence at ""Slammiversary."" There's the aforementioned TNA World Champion Trick Williams, who performs on the ""NXT"" brand. NXT Women's Champion Jacy Jayne will also compete on Sunday, and she has a chance to add another singles championship to her mantle. She will take on TNA Knockouts World Champion Masha Slamovich and the winner will leave New York with two titles. Plus, ""Monday Night Raw"" star AJ Styles will be making an appearance on Sunday. Styles was considered to be the face of TNA for over a decade. Trick Williams (c) vs. Joe Hendry vs. Mike Santana - for the TNA World Championship Since Williams defeated Hendry to capture the TNA World Championship at ""NXT Battleground,"" the storyline has been that Williams doesn't care about TNA's history. It's led to some tension between Hendry and Santana, who have been tasked with bringing TNA's richest male prize back to the company. TNA has been building Santana up as a viable main event player. His popularity has grown substantially not just with TNA fans but with the ""NXT"" audience as well. Hendry remains the biggest star in the company, but his time with the TNA World Championship has come and gone. Many also figure that Hendry is WWE-bound once his contract with TNA comes to an end. For me, this is the time to let Santana run with the ball. You don't get many opportunities to have a perfect storm in wrestling, and Santana winning the gold in his home in honor of his late father is the perfect ending to TNA's summer anniversary. Prediction: Mike Santana Masha Slamovich (c) vs. Jacy Jayne (c) - for both the TNA Knockouts World Championship and the NXT Women's Championship There are quite a few ways to get to the finish of this title-for-title crossover match, but I believe the winner will remain the same. Jayne is in the midst of a storyline with Blake Monroe on ""NXT."" WWE has been quickly building up Monroe as a star of the future, and I don't see Jayne losing her title until the two share the ring. Slamovich has been the TNA Knockouts World Champion since Oct. 2024, and losing to Jayne due to outside interference would protect her. Rather than the actions of Fallon Henley and Jazmyn Nyx playing a role in the finish, I can see Blake Monroe making a surprise appearance to cost Slamovich the match. It appears WWE is leaning into the story that Monroe wants Jayne all to herself when they inevitably clash for the NXT Women's Championship. Prediction: Jacy Jayne The Nemeths (c) vs. The Hardys vs. The Rascalz vs. Fir$t Cla$ - ladder match for the TNA World Tag Team Championship During Thursday's episode of ""TNA iMPACT,"" The Hardys hinted at a split if they don't emerge victorious on Sunday. It's hard for me to see Matt and Jeff Hardy parting ways as a team, given that they're still one of the most popular acts in TNA Wrestling. Fans haven't gotten tired of the legendary tag team. TNA's creative team could ultimately decide to have The Nemeths retain at ""Slammiversary"" and put a bow on their rivalry with The Hardys at the next PPV with a stipulation. That's where it can become a true do-or-die scenario for The Hardys' future as a team. Ultimately, I think TNA decides to give The Hardys a title win in New York, which would draw a sizable reaction from the crowd at UBS Arena. Prediction: The Hardys Moose (c) vs. Leon Slater It's become clear that Slater is destined to capture plenty of championships throughout his career. The 20-year-old uses his athleticism to his advantage, but he's also wise beyond his years in the ring. His time with The Hardys has also done wonders for his growth both as a performer and as someone fans can get behind. I like the story TNA has told of why a win would hold significance for both men. Slater is trying to become the youngest champion in TNA history. Moose wants to become the record holder for the longest TNA X Division Championship reign. With momentum on his side, it might be time for Slater to capture his first major singles title and make history in the process. Prediction: Leon Slater The Elegance Brand (c) vs. The IInspiration - for the TNA Knockouts World Tag Team Championship Heather and Ash by Elegance have been on a roll since forming a team in TNA.
