EAF08F5EC939AAFE9B96F88DE3FB95CB,"  MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage (I charge from £1,150 for mine). Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 (£19.55, www.amazon.co.uk), Olaplex No.8 (£22.40, www.sephora.co.uk) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer (£21, www.boots.com). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner (£27, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner (£26, www.harrods.com). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now £17.99, sha op.toni www.ndguy.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now £12, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo (£24.50, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment (£25). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

1m35rjh,"  First four pictures is my current day two hair, and I did my more lazy routine so it doesn't look great: shampoo with andalou naturals sunflower and citrus shampoo, squish to condish with andalou naturals marula oil conditioner, scrunch in amika hydro rush leave in conditioner, plop for 10 minutes, and air dry. 5th picture is the shortest my hair has looked, and 6th picture is close to longest when I used to wear it out brushed out and waist length. 7th picture is shorter hair on a really good hair day, and 8th is shorter on a low volume day example (prolly using up a too heavy conditioner). I loveeee long magical hair and think it's so pretty, but I thought when I went shorter it looked really good and healthier. I was too scared to go above my shoulder then, but now that my hair's a bit longer, I'm heavily considering it. I trimmed an inch and put in some shorter layering in the front yesterday, but I'm not feeling completely satisfied. I feel like the hair itself would look better, but I don't know if it will go with my face, and I do not understand face shapes lol. Should I just yolo and do it!?","First four pictures is my current day two hair, and I did my more lazy routine so it doesn't look great: shampoo with andalou naturals sunflower and citrus shampoo, squish to condish with andalou naturals marula oil conditioner, scrunch in amika hydro rush leave in conditioner, plop for 10 minutes, and air dry. 5th picture is the shortest my hair has looked, and 6th picture is close to longest when I used to wear it out brushed out and waist length. 7th picture is shorter hair on a really good hair day, and 8th is shorter on a low volume day example (prolly using up a too heavy conditioner).

n43xjm5,"  And I feel the opposite, haha! I was hoping to see some great skincare, in addition to some nice foundations (and *some* makeup - but I am more of a skincare girlie, lol). For me, I think that the RMS concealer might be okay/nice to try - assuming they offer the shade I need (000 or 00, based on their website - I'm Casper, lol) and maybe the Makeup by Mario highlighter might be okay, too (if it's not super flashy, as they describe it), when it comes to makeup... as I have way too many mascaras, eyeshadow palettes (especially the same colour story), eyeliners, and clear brow gel (plus I just got that same brow gel in my July GB). Never mind that they don't seem all that ""luxe"" to me. When it comes to hair and skincare, the Kopari, Odacité, Amika, Briogeo, & Saturday Skin products aren't too bad - but again, they're not giving ""luxury"" or *Icon Box* to me... idk what I'm hoping for, I guess... I mean, I don't think I'd be ***MAD*** if I got a few of the spoiled items that I have my eye on and some other nice (luxe) products, as well as other ones that follow my preferences and whose price-points actually fit an Icon Box. Hbu? Would you be happy with a box that had a few of these makeup products as well as others that fit your preferences and that are suitable from an Icon Box? With all of their constant price increases that they claim are going to help them give us better quality, better products, etc.. , we should be getting the highest-end, most awesome boxes yet, at this point!!!","And I feel the opposite, haha!
