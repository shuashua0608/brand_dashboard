A detangling brush, because if you think getting tangles out of your hair is hard, try doing it for a squirmy, screeching toddler. With more than 60,000 5-star ratings, parents love that this brush makes wet or dry brushing a lot less painful for everyone. Promising review: ""I'm a single dad of a 6-year-old girl, and combing her hair is the hardest part of taking care of her. She gets really bad knots in her hair. This brush is the only thing that has ever worked. Thank you so much. She even likes to comb her own hair now."" —Eric Phan Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in eight colors) 2. A cradle cap comb if your baby has hard-to-remove flakes on their sensitive scalp (like ours did)! We used this tool to help remove it gently — just add an oil, massage it on, and go to work. Your baby will feel like they're at a trendy head spa. Read more about cradle cap — aka seborrheic dermatitis — at Seattle Children's and the American Academy of Dermatology. Promising review: ""I wish I had taken pictures of the amount of dead skin I have gotten off my newborn's head!!!! The pictures posted here are legit. It makes removal so much easier and gives more consistent removal than my previous method of washcloths or just scratching the cradle cap off with my fingernails. It's amazing and gross and wonderful. My babe doesn't even flinch when I spend 10 minutes clearing his scalp of all the goo. It seems to be soothing to him. I just apply baby shampoo, then brush a little with the blue brush. Then, I slowly started to comb the sections all in one direction. Then I go back and forth in different directions. It's shocking the amount of dead skin that comes off. I've even used it successfully in his eyebrows (he gets some cradle cap there, too). This is a KEEPER!"" —ZMomUtah Get it from Amazon for $5.99 3. A leave-in conditioning spray for curly hair to bring life to your little one's hair. As a curly-haired girl myself, I know firsthand that it can be harder to get tangles out. Spray this after washing to keep things shiny, smooth, and frizz free for your little one. Promising review: ""This stuff is fantastic for curly girls! I spray it in my daughter's dry hair in the morning, run my fingers through her ringlets (never ever comb or brush curly hair dry), and then clip the top back. It smells amazing, and the price on Amazon is better than other national retailers I've found it at. The price is worth it. Minimizes frizz and keeps curls soft and natural-looking. My daughter has soft/fine thick hair."" —Carolyn Smith Get it from Amazon for $7.49+ (available in two sizes and a two-pack). 4. A scalp massager for those long summer days when you need a little help getting the dirt, sand, grass, ice cream, spilled juice, and more out of your toddler's hair. (Use this on your scalp, too, for some extra relaxation.) Promising review: ""My daughter had lots of problems with [a] dry scalp; after using this for just a few days, her scalp looks great! No more dandruff or dry patches. She loves it and uses it all the time now."" —april Get it from Amazon for $4.96+ (available in three colors)...","Tangles don't stand a chance against you (and your sprays, brushes, and satin pillowcases). 1.

Promising reviews: ""I first saw this lotion on TikTok; an influencer was bragging about it! Let me tell you, she did not lie. This lotion is the BEST. It smells fantastic.
