mov_403E17303B2414CB68576CA0E057F949,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Überall Erwachsene, die sich etwas schräge Plüschfiguren an die Handtasche hängen: Labubus sind in diesem Sommer der Trend auf Tiktok und Instagram. Was hat es damit auf sich? Nürnberg - Sie haben große Kulleraugen, Hasenohren, ein böses Grinsen und spitze Zähne - Labubus sind niedlich und hässlich zugleich. In China sind die Fellmonster schon lange angesagt. Jetzt ist der Hype auch nach Deutschland geschwappt - befeuert von etlichen Influencerinnen und Influencern, die sich beim Auspacken der Überraschungsboxen filmen. Der chinesische Hersteller und Händler Pop Mart wird am 25. Juli in Berlin sein erstes Geschäft hierzulande eröffnen. Wird der Labubu-Trend länger bleiben? Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger. Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mit Hilfe dessen man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit dem man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte. Eher nichts für Kinder Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrößten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. „Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer. Labubus sind ein Modeaccessoire, ein Statement. “ Gerne werden diese gut sichtbar an der Handtasche getragen - und kosten auf der offiziellen Pop Mart-Seite ab etwa 19 Euro. In China reicht die Preisspanne in den Läden von 66 Yuan (knapp 7,90 Euro) bis 1299 Yuan (knapp 155 Euro). Losgetreten hatten den Hype in den USA und Europa laut Ulrich Stars wie Rihanna, Madonna oder Dua Lipa, die sich mit Labububs in der Öffentlichkeit zeigten. Der Münchner Trendforscher Axel Dammler meint: Genau dafür seien die Figuren gedacht. „Die will ich zeigen. “ Um zu demonstrieren, dass man ein Trendsetter sei und es einem gelungen sei, eins der begehrten Exemplare zu ergattern. Labubus unterm Hammer Gerade in China wollen das viele zeigen: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter große Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der „The Monsters“-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. „Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten“, sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Hypes Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging.

mov_93C6E5DF1C598CBFE2AAFBC53EFACDF8,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Überall Erwachsene, die sich etwas schräge Plüschfiguren an die Handtasche hängen: Labubus sind in diesem Sommer der Trend auf Tiktok und Instagram. Was hat es damit auf sich? Trendige Fellmonster Nürnberg (dpa) - Sie haben große Kulleraugen, Hasenohren, ein böses Grinsen und spitze Zähne - Labubus sind niedlich und hässlich zugleich. In China sind die Fellmonster schon lange angesagt. Jetzt ist der Hype auch nach Deutschland geschwappt - befeuert von etlichen Influencerinnen und Influencern, die sich beim Auspacken der Überraschungsboxen filmen. Der chinesische Hersteller und Händler Pop Mart wird am 25. Juli in Berlin sein erstes Geschäft hierzulande eröffnen. Wird der Labubu-Trend länger bleiben? Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger. Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mit Hilfe dessen man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit dem man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte. Eher nichts für Kinder Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrößten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. «Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer. Labubus sind ein Modeaccessoire, ein Statement. » Gerne werden diese gut sichtbar an der Handtasche getragen - und kosten auf der offiziellen Pop Mart-Seite ab etwa 19 Euro. In China reicht die Preisspanne in den Läden von 66 Yuan (knapp 7,90 Euro) bis 1299 Yuan (knapp 155 Euro). Losgetreten hatten den Hype in den USA und Europa laut Ulrich Stars wie Rihanna, Madonna oder Dua Lipa, die sich mit Labububs in der Öffentlichkeit zeigten. Der Münchner Trendforscher Axel Dammler meint: Genau dafür seien die Figuren gedacht. «Die will ich zeigen. » Um zu demonstrieren, dass man ein Trendsetter sei und es einem gelungen sei, eins der begehrten Exemplare zu ergattern. Labubus unterm Hammer Gerade in China wollen das viele zeigen: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter große Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der «The Monsters»-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. «Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten», sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Hypes Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft.

Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger.

In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der ""The Monsters""-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. ""Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten"", sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Hypes Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging. Eine Anfrage zur Strategie des Unternehmens ließ Pop Mart unbeantwortet. Die Popularität der wertvollen Figuren ließ bereits Fälschungen in Umlauf geraten, die etwa der chinesische Zoll fand. Wer einen Fake erkennen will, kann dem Zoll zufolge die Zähne der Labubus zählen: Die echten hätten immer neun. Zudem schritt die Finanzaufsicht in Teilen Chinas bereits ein, als eine Bank Neukunden mit Labubu-Boxen bei einer Konto-Neueröffnung anwarb. Was macht die Tierchen so begehrlich? Dass die Labubus meist schnell ausverkauft seien, gehöre zur Strategie von Pop Mart, sagt Ulrich. ""Das weckt zusätzliche Begehrlichkeit, wenn man nicht sofort an die Produkte kommt."" Zum Konzept gehört auch, dass die Labubus oft in der sogenannten Blind Box verkauft werden, bei der man nicht weiß, welches Kuschelmonster sich darin befindet.

Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mit dem man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit dem man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte. Eher nichts für Kinder Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrößten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. «Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer. Labubus sind ein Modeaccessoire, ein Statement. » Gerne werden diese gut sichtbar an der Handtasche getragen – und kosten auf der offiziellen Pop Mart-Seite ab etwa 19 Euro. In China reicht die Preisspanne in den Läden von 66 Yuan (knapp 7,90 Euro) bis 1299 Yuan (knapp 155 Euro). Losgetreten hatten den Hype in den USA und Europa laut Ulrich Stars wie Rihanna, Madonna oder Dua Lipa, die sich mit Labububs in der Öffentlichkeit zeigten. Der Münchner Trendforscher Axel Dammler meint: Genau dafür seien die Figuren gedacht. «Die will ich zeigen. » Um zu demonstrieren, dass man ein Trendsetter sei und es einem gelungen sei, eins der begehrten Exemplare zu ergattern. Labubus unterm Hammer Gerade in China wollen das viele zeigen: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter große Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der «The Monsters»-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. Die Labubus sind am Pop-Mart-Automaten oft ausverkauft. In den Läden sind immer wieder Sammler anzutreffen, die sorgfältig die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erraten, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer sicher gehen möchte, versucht online eine zu bekommen. Allerdings waren auch neue Labubu-Serien online zuletzt oft innerhalb von Sekunden ausverkauft. Daher stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen auf Second-Hand-Plattformen deutlich an. «Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten», sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Hypes Der Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart, der 2010 gegründet wurde, erlebt einen Aufschwung im Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging. Eine Anfrage zur Strategie des Unternehmens blieb unbeantwortet. Die wertvollen Figuren sind so beliebt geworden, dass bereits Fälschungen aufgetaucht sind, die vom chinesischen Zoll entdeckt wurden. Um eine Fälschung zu erkennen, sollte man laut Zoll die Zähne der Labubus zählen: Die echten haben immer neun. Außerdem hat die Finanzaufsicht in Teilen Chinas eingegriffen, als eine Bank Neukunden mit Labubu-Boxen bei Kontoeröffnungen lockte. Was macht die Tierchen so begehrlich? Dass die Labubus meist schnell ausverkauft seien, gehöre zur Strategie von Pop Mart, sagt Ulrich. «Das weckt zusätzliche Begehrlichkeit, wenn man nicht sofort an die Produkte kommt. » Zum Konzept gehört auch, dass die Labubus oft in der sogenannten Blind Box verkauft werden, bei der man nicht weiß, welches Kuschelmonster sich darin befindet. Das Auspacken der Box, gefolgt von entweder purer Begeisterung oder bitterer Enttäuschung, erfreut sich auf Instagram und Tiktok großer Beliebtheit. Der sogenannte Unboxing-Trend existiert dort schon seit geraumer Zeit. Allerdings gab es laut Dammler lange Zeit kein neues Thema dazu. Gleichzeitig passen die Labubus gut zum aktuellen Asien-Trend, den K-Pop-Bands, Anime-Filme und Manga-Comics hierzulande ausgelöst haben. Flacht die Welle ab? Trotzdem ist Dammler skeptisch, dass die Labubus zum Dauerbrenner werden. «Die Hype-Welle ist aufgebaut. Ich denke, dass man sie aktuell gut verkaufen kann. » Allerdings müssten die Figuren deutlich günstiger werden und besser erhältlich sein, um die breite Masse anzusprechen, sagt der Experte vom Münchner Marktforschungsunternehmen Iconkids & Youth....",2025-07-14 08:45:56,de,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"This is a comprehensive German article specifically about Pop Mart's Labubu designer toy brand, discussing its popularity, market trends, collectibility, pricing, and cultural significance.

Was hat es damit auf sich? Trendige Fellmonster Nürnberg (dpa) - Sie haben große Kulleraugen, Hasenohren, ein böses Grinsen und spitze Zähne - Labubus sind niedlich und hässlich zugleich. In China sind die Fellmonster schon lange angesagt. Jetzt ist der Hype auch nach Deutschland geschwappt - befeuert von etlichen Influencerinnen und Influencern, die sich beim Auspacken der Überraschungsboxen filmen. Der chinesische Hersteller und Händler Pop Mart wird am 25. Juli in Berlin sein erstes Geschäft hierzulande eröffnen. Wird der Labubu-Trend länger bleiben? Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger. Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mit Hilfe dessen man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit dem man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte. Eher nichts für Kinder Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrößten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. «Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer. Labubus sind ein Modeaccessoire, ein Statement. » Gerne werden diese gut sichtbar an der Handtasche getragen - und kosten auf der offiziellen Pop Mart-Seite ab etwa 19 Euro. In China reicht die Preisspanne in den Läden von 66 Yuan (knapp 7,90 Euro) bis 1299 Yuan (knapp 155 Euro). Losgetreten hatten den Hype in den USA und Europa laut Ulrich Stars wie Rihanna, Madonna oder Dua Lipa, die sich mit Labububs in der Öffentlichkeit zeigten. Der Münchner Trendforscher Axel Dammler meint: Genau dafür seien die Figuren gedacht. «Die will ich zeigen. » Um zu demonstrieren, dass man ein Trendsetter sei und es einem gelungen sei, eins der begehrten Exemplare zu ergattern. Labubus unterm Hammer Gerade in China wollen das viele zeigen: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter große Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der «The Monsters»-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. «Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten», sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking.

An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. «Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten», sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Hypes Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging. Eine Anfrage zur Strategie des Unternehmens ließ Pop Mart unbeantwortet. Die Popularität der wertvollen Figuren ließ bereits Fälschungen in Umlauf geraten, die etwa der chinesische Zoll fand. Wer einen Fake erkennen will, kann dem Zoll zufolge die Zähne der Labubus zählen: Die echten hätten immer neun. Zudem schritt die Finanzaufsicht in Teilen Chinas bereits ein, als eine Bank Neukunden mit Labubu-Boxen bei einer Konto-Neueröffnung anwarb. Was macht die Tierchen so begehrlich? Dass die Labubus meist schnell ausverkauft seien, gehöre zur Strategie von Pop Mart, sagt Ulrich. «Das weckt zusätzliche Begehrlichkeit, wenn man nicht sofort an die Produkte kommt. » Zum Konzept gehört auch, dass die Labubus oft in der sogenannten Blind Box verkauft werden, bei der man nicht weiß, welches Kuschelmonster sich darin befindet.

Gleichzeitig passten die Labubus gut zum aktuellen Asien-Trend, den K-Pop-Bands, Anime-Filme und Manga-Comics hierzulande ausgelöst hätten. Flacht die Welle ab?

mov_D0F09DC2CA402786164847EE89FE6428,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Überall Erwachsene, die sich etwas schräge Plüschfiguren an die Handtasche hängen: Labubus sind in diesem Sommer der Trend auf Tiktok und Instagram. Was hat es damit auf sich? Sie haben große Kulleraugen, Hasenohren, ein böses Grinsen und spitze Zähne - Labubus sind niedlich und hässlich zugleich. In China sind die Fellmonster schon lange angesagt. Jetzt ist der Hype auch nach Deutschland geschwappt - befeuert von etlichen Influencerinnen und Influencern, die sich beim Auspacken der Überraschungsboxen filmen. Der chinesische Hersteller und Händler Pop Mart wird am 25. Juli in Berlin sein erstes Geschäft hierzulande eröffnen. Wird der Labubu-Trend länger bleiben? Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger. Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mit Hilfe dessen man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit dem man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte. Eher nichts für Kinder Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrößten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. »Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer. Labubus sind ein Modeaccessoire, ein Statement. « Gerne werden diese gut sichtbar an der Handtasche getragen - und kosten auf der offiziellen Pop Mart-Seite ab etwa 19 Euro.

Labubus unterm Hammer Gerade in China wollen das viele zeigen: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter große Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der »The Monsters«-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen.

mov_6474E1AEAEDA0AC03C9180CE6533AB7B,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Nürnberg - Sie haben grosse Kulleraugen, Hasenohren, ein böses Grinsen und spitze Zähne - Labubus sind niedlich und hässlich zugleich. In China sind die Fellmonster schon lange angesagt. Jetzt ist der Hype auch nach Deutschland geschwappt - befeuert von etlichen Influencerinnen und Influencern, die sich beim Auspacken der Überraschungsboxen filmen. Der chinesische Hersteller und Händler Pop Mart wird am 25. Juli in Berlin sein erstes Geschäft hierzulande eröffnen. Wird der Labubu-Trend länger bleiben? Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger. Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mit Hilfe dessen man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit dem man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte. Eher nichts für Kinder Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrössten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. ""Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer. Labubus sind ein Modeaccessoire, ein Statement."" Gerne werden diese gut sichtbar an der Handtasche getragen - und kosten auf der offiziellen Pop Mart-Seite ab etwa 19 Euro. In China reicht die Preisspanne in den Läden von 66 Yuan (knapp 7,90 Euro) bis 1299 Yuan (knapp 155 Euro). Losgetreten hatten den Hype in den USA und Europa laut Ulrich Stars wie Rihanna, Madonna oder Dua Lipa, die sich mit Labububs in der Öffentlichkeit zeigten. Der Münchner Trendforscher Axel Dammler meint: Genau dafür seien die Figuren gedacht. ""Die will ich zeigen."" Um zu demonstrieren, dass man ein Trendsetter sei und es einem gelungen sei, eins der begehrten Exemplare zu ergattern. Labubus unterm Hammer Gerade in China wollen das viele zeigen: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter grosse Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der ""The Monsters""-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. ""Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten"", sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Hypes Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging. Eine Anfrage zur Strategie des Unternehmens liess Pop Mart unbeantwortet. Die Popularität der wertvollen Figuren liess bereits Fälschungen in Umlauf geraten, die etwa der chinesische Zoll fand. Wer einen Fake erkennen will, kann dem Zoll zufolge die Zähne der Labubus zählen: Die echten hätten immer neun.

""Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten"", sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking.

Woher der Hype um die kuscheligen Monster kommt – und warum sie auch kritisiert werden. Ein neues Trend-Accessoire aus Asien erobert Deutschland und die Welt: die Labubus. Kleine, flauschige Monster mit einem schelmischen Grinsen, spitzen Zähnen und einem Herz auf der Nase. Zu finden sind sie meist als bunte Anhänger an Taschen von Sammlerinnen und Sammlern. Unboxing-Videos der Plüschfiguren erreichen Aufrufzahlen teils in Millionenhöhe, Fans warten oft Stunden in der Schlange, um eine der beliebten Figuren zu bekommen. Doch was steckt hinter dem Hype? Trend auf Tiktok und Instagram: Woher kommen Labubus? Die Labubus spielen Nebencharaktere in der Serie „The Monsters“ (2015) des Künstlers Kasing Lung aus Hongkong. Dieser hat sich beim Design der Monster-Elfen von der nordischen Folklore inspirieren lassen. Aufgrund ihrer wachsenden Beliebtheit entstand 2019 eine Kooperation mit dem chinesischen Unternehmen Pop Mart. Dort werden die Figuren seither vorrangig als Vinylspielzeuge oder Schlüsselanhänger zum Sammeln verkauft. Weltweite Bekanntheit erlangten die Labubus, als die K-Pop-Sängerin Lisa der Band „Black Pink“ im vergangenen Jahr Fotos auf Instagram veröffentlichte, auf denen die Plüschfigur als Accessoire zu erkennen sind. Seither sind die Monster-Elfen bei Fans und Promis, wie Rihanna oder Dua Lipa gleichermaßen beliebt. Darum sind Labubus so gefragt Doch warum sind die süß-gruseligen Figuren so begehrt? Zum einen können sich Fans ihren Labubu nicht einfach aussuchen und kaufen – die Figuren werden traditionell in blickdichten Boxen verkauft. Gerade dieser Überraschungseffekt reizt viele Sammler: Erst beim Auspacken erfahren sie, welche Variante sie tatsächlich erworben haben. Neben den unterschiedlichen Farbvarianten enthält jede Edition außerdem eine geheime Figur, deren Aussehen zunächst unbekannt bleibt – und die unter Liebhabern besonders begehrt ist. Zudem sind die Labubus bewusst nicht unbegrenzt verfügbar. Nach dem Prinzip der künstlichen Verknappung gelangt nur ein begrenztes Kontingent der Plüschfiguren in den Handel. Die neuen Modelle sind deshalb meist schon wenige Sekunden nach Verkaufsstart ausverkauft. Entweder man ergattert eine Sammlerfigur – oder geht leer aus. Ein weiterer Kaufanreiz dürfte die sogenannte „FOMO“ („Fear of Missing Out“) sein – die Angst, etwas zu verpassen. Denn derzeit scheint fast jeder Tiktoker mindestens einen, wenn nicht gleich drei oder vier Labubus zu besitzen. Bei vielen Followern wächst dadurch der Wunsch, dazuzugehören und Teil des Trends zu sein. Als deutsche „Labubu-Queen“ gilt die Berliner Instagramerin Paula Senfkorn, die ihre Fans regelmäßig beim Shoppen und Auspacken teilhaben lässt. So nimmt sie ihre Follower etwa mit in ein Einkaufszentrum in Berlin, in dem Freunde von ihr Labubus entdeckt hatten. Überraschenderweise waren die weltweit vergriffenen Plüschfiguren dort tatsächlich erhältlich – allerdings zum dreifachen Preis im Vergleich zur Originalveröffentlichung. Labubus gibt es Ende Juli auch in Berlin Bislang können Sammler in Deutschland die rund zehn Zentimeter großen Monster-Elfen meist nur online oder in ausgewählten Läden in Europa und Asien kaufen. Doch das soll sich Ende Juli ändern: Im Berliner Einkaufszentrum Alexa eröffnet der erste Pop-Mart-Store in Deutschland. Medienberichten zufolge könnten weitere Filialen in Berlin und Frankfurt folgen. In stationären Geschäften kosten die Plüschmonster in der Regel etwa 15 Euro – online hingegen sind sie oft deutlich teurer. Weil die Figuren so beliebt sind, sind Fans jedoch dazu bereit, nicht wenig für das Spielzeug zu bezahlen: Für eine lebensgroße Labubu-Puppe haben Sammler in Peking umgerechnet rund 130 Euro ausgegeben. Sammlerstücke bei Originalhändler Pop Mart ausverkauft Beim chinesischen Hersteller und Originalshop Pop Mart gibt es Labubus in den verschiedensten Farben und Ausführungen – etwa in schlichtem Beige, als pinke Yoga-Version oder als Hip-Hop-Figur. Die günstigsten Modelle kosten rund 15 Euro. Für aufwendigere Editionen wie den „How to Train Your Dragon“-Labubu – eine Kooperation mit dem Film „Drachenzähmen leicht gemacht“ – müssen Fans bis zu 120 Euro investieren. Allerdings sind derzeit alle Figuren aufgrund künstlicher Verknappung und hoher Nachfrage ausverkauft. In anderen Online-Shops sind die Sammlerfiguren zwar noch zu haben, dafür aber zu deutlich höheren Preisen. So kostet eine Mystery Box bei hypeneedz zwischen 59 und 109 Euro. Mehr Glück können Fans beim Fanartikel-Shop Elbenwald haben. Gelegentlich werden hier Labubus für 24,95 Euro angeboten. Kritik: Der Hype um Labubus fördert Überkonsum Doch der Hype um die Labubus bleibt nicht ohne Kritik. Wie bei vielen Trends gibt es auch hier Fans, die sich nicht nur ein oder zwei Exemplare zulegen, sondern gleich ganze Berge davon horten – nur um sie später wieder auszusortieren, sobald der Hype nachlässt.

Gerade in China wollen das viele zeigen: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter große Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der „The Monsters“-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. „Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten“, sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging. Eine Anfrage zur Strategie des Unternehmens ließ Pop Mart unbeantwortet. Die Popularität der wertvollen Figuren ließ bereits Fälschungen in Umlauf geraten, die etwa der chinesische Zoll fand. Wer einen Fake erkennen will, kann dem Zoll zufolge die Zähne der Labubus zählen: Die echten hätten immer neun. Zudem schritt die Finanzaufsicht in Teilen Chinas bereits ein, als eine Bank Neukunden mit Labubu-Boxen bei einer Konto-Neueröffnung anwarb. Dass die Labubus meist schnell ausverkauft seien, gehöre zur Strategie von Pop Mart, sagt Ulrich. „Das weckt zusätzliche Begehrlichkeit, wenn man nicht sofort an die Produkte kommt. “ Zum Konzept gehört auch, dass die Labubus oft in der sogenannten Blind Box verkauft werden, bei der man nicht weiß, welches Kuschelmonster sich darin befindet. Box auspacken, gefolgt von schierer Begeisterung oder herber Enttäuschung - auf Instagram und Tiktok kommen solche Clips gut an. Den sogenannten Unboxing-Trend gibt es dort zwar schon länger. Allerdings habe es lange Zeit kein neues Thema mehr dazu gegeben, sagt Dammler. Gleichzeitig passten die Labubus gut zum aktuellen Asien-Trend, den K-Pop-Bands, Anime-Filme und Manga-Comics hierzulande ausgelöst hätten. Trotzdem ist Dammler skeptisch, dass die Labubus zum Dauerbrenner werden. „Die Hype-Welle ist aufgebaut. Ich denke, dass man sie aktuell gut verkaufen kann. “ Allerdings müssten die Figuren deutlich günstiger werden und besser erhältlich sein, um die breite Masse anzusprechen, sagt der Experte vom Münchner Marktforschungsunternehmen Iconkids & Youth. „Sonst bleibt es bei Trendsettern und Sammlern. “ Die Frage sei auch, wie geht es weiter?

An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. „Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten“, sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Hypes Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging. Eine Anfrage zur Strategie des Unternehmens ließ Pop Mart unbeantwortet. Die Popularität der wertvollen Figuren ließ bereits Fälschungen in Umlauf geraten, die etwa der chinesische Zoll fand. Wer einen Fake erkennen will, kann dem Zoll zufolge die Zähne der Labubus zählen: Die echten hätten immer neun. Zudem schritt die Finanzaufsicht in Teilen Chinas bereits ein, als eine Bank Neukunden mit Labubu-Boxen bei einer Konto-Neueröffnung anwarb. Was macht die Tierchen so begehrlich? Dass die Labubus meist schnell ausverkauft seien, gehöre zur Strategie von Pop Mart, sagt Ulrich. „Das weckt zusätzliche Begehrlichkeit, wenn man nicht sofort an die Produkte kommt. “ Zum Konzept gehört auch, dass die Labubus oft in der sogenannten Blind Box verkauft werden, bei der man nicht weiß, welches Kuschelmonster sich darin befindet.

Allerdings habe es lange Zeit kein neues Thema mehr dazu gegeben, sagt Dammler. Gleichzeitig passten die Labubus gut zum aktuellen Asien-Trend, den K-Pop-Bands, Anime-Filme und Manga-Comics hierzulande ausgelöst hätten. Flacht die Welle ab?

Jetzt ist der Hype auch nach Deutschland geschwappt - befeuert von etlichen Influencerinnen und Influencern, die sich beim Auspacken der Überraschungsboxen filmen. Der chinesische Hersteller und Händler Pop Mart wird am 25. Juli in Berlin sein erstes Geschäft hierzulande eröffnen. Wird der Labubu-Trend länger bleiben? Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger. Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mit Hilfe dessen man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit dem man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte. Eher nichts für Kinder Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrößten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. ""Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer. Labubus sind ein Modeaccessoire, ein Statement."" Gerne werden diese gut sichtbar an der Handtasche getragen - und kosten auf der offiziellen Pop Mart-Seite ab etwa 19 Euro. In China reicht die Preisspanne in den Läden von 66 Yuan (knapp 7,90 Euro) bis 1299 Yuan (knapp 155 Euro). Losgetreten hatten den Hype in den USA und Europa laut Ulrich Stars wie Rihanna, Madonna oder Dua Lipa, die sich mit Labububs in der Öffentlichkeit zeigten. Der Münchner Trendforscher Axel Dammler meint: Genau dafür seien die Figuren gedacht. ""Die will ich zeigen."" Um zu demonstrieren, dass man ein Trendsetter sei und es einem gelungen sei, eins der begehrten Exemplare zu ergattern. Labubus unterm Hammer Gerade in China wollen das viele zeigen: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter große Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der ""The Monsters""-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. ""Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten"", sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Hypes Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging. Eine Anfrage zur Strategie des Unternehmens ließ Pop Mart unbeantwortet. Die Popularität der wertvollen Figuren ließ bereits Fälschungen in Umlauf geraten, die etwa der chinesische Zoll fand. Wer einen Fake erkennen will, kann dem Zoll zufolge die Zähne der Labubus zählen: Die echten hätten immer neun. Zudem schritt die Finanzaufsicht in Teilen Chinas bereits ein, als eine Bank Neukunden mit Labubu-Boxen bei einer Konto-Neueröffnung anwarb. Was macht die Tierchen so begehrlich? Dass die Labubus meist schnell ausverkauft seien, gehöre zur Strategie von Pop Mart, sagt Ulrich. ""Das weckt zusätzliche Begehrlichkeit, wenn man nicht sofort an die Produkte kommt."" Zum Konzept gehört auch, dass die Labubus oft in der sogenannten Blind Box verkauft werden, bei der man nicht weiß, welches Kuschelmonster sich darin befindet. Box auspacken, gefolgt von schierer Begeisterung oder herber Enttäuschung - auf Instagram und Tiktok kommen solche Clips gut an. Den sogenannten Unboxing-Trend gibt es dort zwar schon länger. Allerdings habe es lange Zeit kein neues Thema mehr dazu gegeben, sagt Dammler. Gleichzeitig passten die Labubus gut zum aktuellen Asien-Trend, den K-Pop-Bands, Anime-Filme und Manga-Comics hierzulande ausgelöst hätten. Flacht die Welle ab? Trotzdem ist Dammler skeptisch, dass die Labubus zum Dauerbrenner werden.

Urvashi Rautela is known for her stunning and bold pictures on social media, but she also faces criticism from online users too. Whether it's her interviews, public appearances or other unusual moments, she never fails to be in the spotlight for unexpected reasons. Recently, Urvashi caught attention again at Wimbledon 2025, where she was seen carrying four Labubus on a Birkin bag. Despite the mixed reactions, she keeps staying in the news. Here are a few past moments when she made headlines for bizarre reasons. 1 – grabbed attention at Wimbledon 2025 not for her outfit or presence, but for an unexpected accessory. The actress arrived at the event carrying a luxury bag, but what stood out were four Labubu dolls attached to it. Labubu is a cartoon-like character popular among collectors, but seeing four of them dangling from such an expensive bag at a major sports event left many confused. Recommended Stories 2 – Back in 2018, Urvashi Rautela faced dating rumours after she was spotted with Ahaan Panday, nephew of actor Chunky Panday. Some reports claimed the two were in a relationship, which led to a lot of online trolling. Upset by the unwanted attention, Urvashi decided to clear the air on social media. But instead of writing her own message, she ended up copying a post originally written by model Gigi Hadid, which was about her and singer Zayn Malik. This led to criticism and later, Urvashi blamed her social media team for the mistake. 3 – During an interview with Siddharth Kannan, Urvashi Rautela made a surprising claim that left many people talking. She said there is a temple in Uttarakhand named after her, located near the famous Badrinath temple. When the host asked if she truly believes that people worship her there, she confidently said yes. She also added that some students at Delhi University even offer garlands to her photos and call her Damdamamai. 4 – When Game Changer, starring Kiara Advani and Ram Charan, was released with Urvashi Rautela's Daaku Mahaaraj, many expected Kiara's film to do well because of the big cast and strong buzz. But surprisingly, it didn't perform well at the box office. In contrast, Daaku Mahaaraj received a lot of attention from viewers. During an interview, Urvashi spoke about how people were comparing both films. She pointed out that her movie was released during the Makar Sankranti festival and many were calling it a big hit while calling Game Changer a flop. Urvashi said that it wasn't her fault things turned out this way. 5 – Urvashi Rautela once shared a story about a person she called Mr RP who waited for her in a hotel lobby for hours while she was in New Delhi for an event. She said she was resting in her room and later saw that he had tried to call her many times. Later, people on social media started guessing that Mr RP could be cricketer Rishabh Pant. This sparked speculations about a possible link between the two. Although both Urvashi and Rishabh never directly mentioned each other, they posted indirect and mysterious messages online that kept fans entertained.

Urvashi Rautela never disappoints when it comes to doing something that catches eyes, and this time her next stop was Wimbledon, where she made an appearance in a stunning white gown. But what was unique? It was her purse, to which she attached four Labubu dolls, leaving the internet going gaga over her visit. Now, a day after , the actress has shared an interesting Instagram story by a fan. In the story, the fan created a cute Ghibli-style picture of her image. The Ghibli Studio-inspired image, created through AI, shows Urvashi Rautela looking away from the camera with her purse in her lap. The picture also reimagines the famous Labubu doll in Ghibli style. While sharing the picture, the fan wrote, “Omg… Urvashi Rautela's craze for Labubu.""

Was hat es damit auf sich? Sie haben große Kulleraugen, Hasenohren, ein böses Grinsen und spitze Zähne – Labubus sind niedlich und hässlich zugleich. In China sind die Fellmonster schon lange angesagt. Jetzt ist der Hype auch nach Deutschland geschwappt – befeuert von etlichen Influencerinnen und Influencern, die sich beim Auspacken der Überraschungsboxen filmen. Der chinesische Hersteller und Händler Pop Mart wird am 25. Juli in Berlin sein erstes Geschäft hierzulande eröffnen. Wird der Labubu-Trend länger bleiben? Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger. Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mit Hilfe dessen man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit dem man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte. Eher nichts für Kinder Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrößten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. „Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer.

Losgetreten hatten den Hype in den USA und Europa laut Ulrich Stars wie Rihanna, Madonna oder Dua Lipa, die sich mit Labububs in der Öffentlichkeit zeigten. Der Münchner Trendforscher Axel Dammler meint: Genau dafür seien die Figuren gedacht. „Die will ich zeigen. “ Um zu demonstrieren, dass man ein Trendsetter sei und es einem gelungen sei, eins der begehrten Exemplare zu ergattern. Labubus unterm Hammer Gerade in China wollen das viele zeigen: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter große Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der „The Monsters“-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. „Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten“, sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Hypes Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging. Eine Anfrage zur Strategie des Unternehmens ließ Pop Mart unbeantwortet. Die Popularität der wertvollen Figuren ließ bereits Fälschungen in Umlauf geraten, die etwa der chinesische Zoll fand. Wer einen Fake erkennen will, kann dem Zoll zufolge die Zähne der Labubus zählen: Die echten hätten immer neun. Zudem schritt die Finanzaufsicht in Teilen Chinas bereits ein, als eine Bank Neukunden mit Labubu-Boxen bei einer Konto-Neueröffnung anwarb. Was macht die Tierchen so begehrlich? Dass die Labubus meist schnell ausverkauft seien, gehöre zur Strategie von Pop Mart, sagt Ulrich. „Das weckt zusätzliche Begehrlichkeit, wenn man nicht sofort an die Produkte kommt. “ Zum Konzept gehört auch, dass die Labubus oft in der sogenannten Blind Box verkauft werden, bei der man nicht weiß, welches Kuschelmonster sich darin befindet. Box auspacken, gefolgt von schierer Begeisterung oder herber Enttäuschung – auf Instagram und Tiktok kommen solche Clips gut an. Den sogenannten Unboxing-Trend gibt es dort zwar schon länger. Allerdings habe es lange Zeit kein neues Thema mehr dazu gegeben, sagt Dammler. Gleichzeitig passten die Labubus gut zum aktuellen Asien-Trend, den K-Pop-Bands, Anime-Filme und Manga-Comics hierzulande ausgelöst hätten. Flacht die Welle ab? Trotzdem ist Dammler skeptisch, dass die Labubus zum Dauerbrenner werden. „Die Hype-Welle ist aufgebaut.

Desde Asia hasta América, estos curiosos personajes con mirada y sonrisa traviesa protagonizan una fiebre coleccionista. Pero, ¿qué significa realmente la palabra “Labubu” en chino y cómo se traduce al español? Te contamos todos los detalles detrás de este icónico juguete de diseño, sus orígenes, características, su misterioso nombre, y por qué están conquistando al público. LEE TAMBIÉN. ¡Felicidades Pompompurin, eres el personaje del año de Sanrio! ¿Qué es Labubu en chino? Antes de adentrarnos en el significado del nombre, es importante entender que Labubu (拉布布) no es solo un término, sino el nombre propio de un personaje específico creado por el artista Kasing Lung. Así que, en realidad, “Labubu” no tiene una traducción literal al español , sino que corresponde directamente al nombre distintivo de esta criatura fantástica. En chino, se escribe 拉布布, que fonéticamente se pronuncia Lā bù bù .

La historia de Labubu comienza con la creatividad de Kasing Lung , un artista nacido en Hong Kong en 1972, quien creció en los Países Bajos y actualmente reside en Bélgica. Su fascinación por la mitología nórdica y el folklore europeo marcó profundamente su obra, la cual se materializó en una serie de personajes fantásticos conocidos como “The Monsters” . Labubu nació dentro de esta serie, como un elfo-monstruo de apariencia traviesa y personalidad enigmática.

Existen varias razones que explican por qué los Labubu originales pueden alcanzar precios exorbitantes: Ediciones Limitadas : Muchos modelos de Labubu se producen en cantidades reducidas, lo que los convierte en objetos de deseo para coleccionistas.

It was me, shawn, Shawn's college friend, cam, cams brother and cams mom also my two siblings plus one other friend who isn't of importance in the story. I have this thing of wanting my friends parents to like me(idk it's odd to explain but we all come from households where if we want to go out we still have to ask permission. We can't just leave and go.) so that day I decided to do my make and dress up. Well fast forward me and my siblings along with my other friend arrive first. Eventually cam and shawn plus Shawn's friend comes in. Cam immediately sits next to me and the first thing he says besides hi was “you look really pretty today.” I was flabbergasted. He has never called me pretty nor has anyone in the friend group so this is VERY new territory. Later during the dinner. He told me that he has a lot of fun hanging out with me and I ofc enjoy hanging out with him a lot!!! He then said “me and you should just go to the city”. NOW me and my friend group have been trying to go to this city for a while and usually I make the plans. I wanted to make sure I wasn't jumping to conclusions so I asked “like me and you or me, you and everybody else?” Then he replied with “yeah it could be everyone else or just me and you. It doesn't matter”(something along those lines.) he also said “we should go right when you come back.” Since I am leaving the country for a little bit. Anyways further in the night me and cam plus everyone else went to the arcade. We were playing games and he asked me if I wanted a stuff animal. At first I said “no, you already got me a labubu.” (He paid for half so did my other friend) THEN he said “that doesn't count since I didn't paid for the whole thing.” Now I have two stuff animals that sleep in my bed with me.

mov_FDF31940926AA0274A9BD50163065EF7,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Überall Erwachsene, die sich etwas schräge Plüschfiguren an die Handtasche hängen: Labubus sind in diesem Sommer der Trend auf Tiktok und Instagram. Was hat es damit auf sich? Sie haben große Kulleraugen, Hasenohren, ein böses Grinsen und spitze Zähne – Labubus sind niedlich und hässlich zugleich. In China sind die Fellmonster schon lange angesagt. Jetzt ist der Hype auch nach Deutschland geschwappt – befeuert von etlichen Influencerinnen und Influencern, die sich beim Auspacken der Überraschungsboxen filmen. Der chinesische Hersteller und Händler Pop Mart wird am 25. Juli in Berlin sein erstes Geschäft hierzulande eröffnen. Wird der Labubu-Trend länger bleiben? Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger. Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mit Hilfe dessen man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit dem man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte. Eher nichts für Kinder Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrößten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. «Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer.

Labubus unterm Hammer Gerade in China wollen das viele zeigen: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter große Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der «The Monsters»-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. «Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten», sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Hypes Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging. Eine Anfrage zur Strategie des Unternehmens ließ Pop Mart unbeantwortet. Die Popularität der wertvollen Figuren ließ bereits Fälschungen in Umlauf geraten, die etwa der chinesische Zoll fand. Wer einen Fake erkennen will, kann dem Zoll zufolge die Zähne der Labubus zählen: Die echten hätten immer neun. Zudem schritt die Finanzaufsicht in Teilen Chinas bereits ein, als eine Bank Neukunden mit Labubu-Boxen bei einer Konto-Neueröffnung anwarb. Was macht die Tierchen so begehrlich? Dass die Labubus meist schnell ausverkauft seien, gehöre zur Strategie von Pop Mart, sagt Ulrich. «Das weckt zusätzliche Begehrlichkeit, wenn man nicht sofort an die Produkte kommt. » Zum Konzept gehört auch, dass die Labubus oft in der sogenannten Blind Box verkauft werden, bei der man nicht weiß, welches Kuschelmonster sich darin befindet. Box auspacken, gefolgt von schierer Begeisterung oder herber Enttäuschung – auf Instagram und Tiktok kommen solche Clips gut an. Den sogenannten Unboxing-Trend gibt es dort zwar schon länger. Allerdings habe es lange Zeit kein neues Thema mehr dazu gegeben, sagt Dammler. Gleichzeitig passten die Labubus gut zum aktuellen Asien-Trend, den K-Pop-Bands, Anime-Filme und Manga-Comics hierzulande ausgelöst hätten. Flacht die Welle ab? Trotzdem ist Dammler skeptisch, dass die Labubus zum Dauerbrenner werden. «Die Hype-Welle ist aufgebaut.

Was hat es damit auf sich? Sie haben große Kulleraugen, Hasenohren, ein böses Grinsen und spitze Zähne – Labubus sind niedlich und hässlich zugleich. In China sind die Fellmonster schon lange angesagt. Jetzt ist der Hype auch nach Deutschland geschwappt – befeuert von etlichen Influencerinnen und Influencern, die sich beim Auspacken der Überraschungsboxen filmen. Der chinesische Hersteller und Händler Pop Mart wird am 25. Juli in Berlin sein erstes Geschäft hierzulande eröffnen. Wird der Labubu-Trend länger bleiben? Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger. Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mit Hilfe dessen man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit dem man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte. Eher nichts für Kinder Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrößten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. «Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer.

She left her hair loose and opted for minimal accessories. The Daaku Maharaj actor wore pointy heels to complete her look. She smiled at paps and blew kisses at them before stepping inside again. Take a look: Well, Urvashi wore a white dress and carried a Birkin bag for her outing at Wimbledon 2025. However, the highlight of her look were the four Labubu dolls attached to her bag.

Though Urvashi Rautela didn't caption her post, sharing a video about her Labubu world record implied her agreement with the claim. In the comment box, fans wrote, ““Ohh what an achievement!

In the comment, the actor wrote that she was “honoured” to meet Kate Middleton. Her followers, at once, sprung to action, mocking her caption.

On June 12, Labubu lovers strutted down the sidewalks with the tiny toy monsters clipped to their purses, backpacks, beltloops — even their dogs' harnesses. The model with the best flair won a new toy and, naturally, a purse to hang it on. The evening provided a glimpse into a seemingly sudden worldwide obsession with the blind-box stuffed animal toy, which retails for about $30 and is sold by Chinese collectible company Pop Mart. A Labubu is ""a small monster with high, pointed ears, serrated teeth"" and a ""mischievous"" smile, according to Pop Mart's website. Pop Mart sells hundreds of different versions of Labubu — varying in color and level of rarity — and fans don't know which one they've purchased until unboxing it, much like a sealed pack of baseball cards. More than 1 million TikTok videos mention the eerie little monsters, and they often sell out in minutes. DON'T MISS: A step-by-step guide to buying your first home—and avoiding costly mistakes Fans range from adult fashionistas and toy collectors to parents buying the oddly creepy dolls for their toddlers. They may line up at Pop Mart stores and vending machines for hours, even traveling overseas to get their hands on one. Some Labubus go for hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars on resale marketplaces like StockX or eBay. Pop Mart brought in about 13.04 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) in 2024 global revenue, according to the company's most recent annual results announcement. That included the equivalent of approximately $460 million in profits, the announcement said. Roughly $423 million of the company's global revenue came from Labubu dolls alone, says Emily Brough, Pop Mart's head of intellectual property licensing for the Americas. That's a 729% increase from 2023, she adds. ""We've seen an incredible growth in revenue and interest across all of our IP,"" says Brough. ""Labubu certainly hit astronomical numbers last year."" Here's how Labubu went from a simple collectible toy to a viral, money-making sensation. Building a multibillion-dollar brand Pop Mart was founded in 2010 as a small variety shop in Beijing, China. Its founder, Wang Ning — now 38 — had a knack for retail as an advertising student in college, where he'd sell accessories to his classmates, according to Bloomberg. The business grew steadily, opening another retail store at a mall in 2011 and an online store in 2016. Pop Mart regularly partnered with artists to design and create different toys and figurines, and in 2019, it struck such a deal with artist Kasing Lung, who illustrated a picture book series called ""The Monsters."" Labubu is a character from ""The Monsters,"" and Pop Mart's first wave of Labubu dolls ""broke the [business'] sales record in the art toy category,"" according to the company's website. A year later, Pop Mart started trading publicly in Hong Kong at a $6.9 billion valuation, putting the company within range of international toymakers like Mattel and Hasbro. Shoppers queue at a Pop Mart vending machine to buy collectibles in New Jersey's American Dream Mall. In 2023, Pop Mart started selling versions of Labubus with keyrings attached to them. Then, in April 2024, Lalisa ""Lisa"" Manoban, member of the K-Pop band Blackpink, was spotted with a Labubu on her purse as a bag charm. She unknowingly started a frenzy, as people flocked to get their own monster toy accessory — quickly turning Pop Mart's dolls into a fashion accessory and symbol of social status. Celebrities like Lizzo and billionaire Rihanna put Labubus on their own purses, further popularizing the toy. People customize their dolls, giving them hats, ""designer"" outfits, sunglasses and their own purses. Some people even put real tattoos on their Labubus' faces. Pop Mart's market cap is now $43.28 billion, as of Monday afternoon — far outpacing Mattel's $6.44 billion and Hasbro's $10.63 billion. We're 'building a brand for longevity' The vast majority of Pop Mart's revenue comes from Asia — $1.6 billion in 2024, including $1.1 billion from mainland China alone. Still, Labubus now have hundreds of thousands of fans across the world, including 145,000 ""Monsters"" in Reddit's Labubu community, for example. Pop Mart's 500-plus stores worldwide include more than 90 retail locations in the United States, including vending machines, according to its website. The company's success has pushed Ning's estimated net worth to $21.6 billion, says Forbes. Some Labubu fans say their affection for the plush monsters goes well beyond celebrity influence: They love the unique-looking toys, the personalities Lung created for them and the thrill of trying to get a specific Labubu for their collections. Pop Mart's 2024 revenue by region. Pop Mart's limited supply has reportedly led to customers fighting over Labubus. Rising resale prices have created a market for knockoff Labubus, known as ""Lafufus,"" on platforms like Amazon and AliExpress. Fashion and pop culture trends don't tend to last forever, meaning Labubu dolls could fade in popularity over time. For now, Pop Mart plans to keep expanding internationally — taking advantage of the craze while it exists — and growing its roster of artists to create and sell more characters, says Brough. ""Pop Mart has been around for 15 years and we are really building a brand for longevity,"" she says.

Pop Mart sells hundreds of different versions of Labubu — varying in color and level of rarity — and fans don't know which one they've purchased until unboxing it, much like a sealed pack of baseball cards. More than 1 million TikTok videos mention the eerie little monsters, and they often sell out in minutes. Fans range from adult fashionistas and toy collectors to parents buying the oddly creepy dolls for their toddlers. They may line up at Pop Mart stores and vending machines for hours, even traveling overseas to get their hands on one. Some Labubus go for hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars on resale marketplaces like StockX or eBay. Pop Mart brought in about 13.04 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) in 2024 global revenue, according to the company's most recent annual results announcement. That included the equivalent of approximately $460 million in profits, the announcement said. Roughly $423 million of the company's global revenue came from Labubu dolls alone, says Emily Brough, Pop Mart's head of intellectual property licensing for the Americas. That's a 729% increase from 2023, she adds. ""We've seen an incredible growth in revenue and interest across all of our IP,"" says Brough. ""Labubu certainly hit astronomical numbers last year."" Here's how Labubu went from a simple collectible toy to a viral, money-making sensation. Building a multibillion-dollar brand Pop Mart was founded in 2010 as a small variety shop in Beijing, China. Its founder, Wang Ning — now 38 — had a knack for retail as an advertising student in college, where he'd sell accessories to his classmates, according to Bloomberg. The business grew steadily, opening another retail store at a mall in 2011 and an online store in 2016. Pop Mart regularly partnered with artists to design and create different toys and figurines, and in 2019, it struck such a deal with artist Kasing Lung, who illustrated a picture book series called ""The Monsters."" Labubu is a character from ""The Monsters,"" and Pop Mart's first wave of Labubu dolls ""broke the [business'] sales record in the art toy category,"" according to the company's website. A year later, Pop Mart started trading publicly in Hong Kong at a $6.9 billion valuation, putting the company within range of international toymakers like Mattel and Hasbro. In 2023, Pop Mart started selling versions of Labubus with keyrings attached to them. Then, in April 2024, Lalisa ""Lisa"" Manoban, member of the K-Pop band Blackpink, was spotted with a Labubu on her purse as a bag charm. She unknowingly started a frenzy, as people flocked to get their own monster toy accessory — quickly turning Pop Mart's dolls into a fashion accessory and symbol of social status. Celebrities like Lizzo and billionaire Rihanna put Labubus on their own purses, further popularizing the toy. People customize their dolls, giving them hats, ""designer"" outfits, sunglasses and their own purses. Some people even put real tattoos on their Labubus' faces. Pop Mart's market cap is now $43.28 billion, as of Monday afternoon — far outpacing Mattel's $6.44 billion and Hasbro's $10.63 billion. We're 'building a brand for longevity' The vast majority of Pop Mart's revenue comes from Asia — $1.6 billion in 2024, including $1.1 billion from mainland China alone. Still, Labubus now have hundreds of thousands of fans across the world, including 145,000 ""Monsters"" in Reddit's Labubu community, for example. Pop Mart's 500-plus stores worldwide include more than 90 retail locations in the United States, including vending machines, according to its website. The company's success has pushed Ning's estimated net worth to $21.6 billion, says Forbes. Some Labubu fans say their affection for the plush monsters goes well beyond celebrity influence: They love the unique-looking toys, the personalities Lung created for them and the thrill of trying to get a specific Labubu for their collections. Pop Mart's limited supply has reportedly led to customers fighting over Labubus. Rising resale prices have created a market for knockoff Labubus, known as ""Lafufus,"" on platforms like Amazon and AliExpress. Fashion and pop culture trends don't tend to last forever, meaning Labubu dolls could fade in popularity over time. For now, Pop Mart plans to keep expanding internationally — taking advantage of the craze while it exists — and growing its roster of artists to create and sell more characters, says Brough. ""Pop Mart has been around for 15 years and we are really building a brand for longevity,"" she says. ""As we continue to diversify our artists' portfolio and diversify the ways that people can really interact with our characters, we will continue our mission to light up passion and bring joy for years to come.""

On June 12, Labubu lovers strutted down the sidewalks with the tiny toy monsters clipped to their purses, backpacks, beltloops — even their dogs' harnesses. The model with the best flair won a new toy and, naturally, a purse to hang it on. The evening provided a glimpse into a seemingly sudden worldwide obsession with the blind-box stuffed animal toy, which retails for about $30 and is sold by Chinese collectible company Pop Mart. A Labubu is ""a small monster with high, pointed ears, serrated teeth"" and a ""mischievous"" smile, according to Pop Mart's website. Pop Mart sells hundreds of different versions of Labubu — varying in color and level of rarity — and fans don't know which one they've purchased until unboxing it, much like a sealed pack of baseball cards. More than 1 million TikTok videos mention the eerie little monsters, and they often sell out in minutes. DON'T MISS: A step-by-step guide to buying your first home—and avoiding costly mistakes Fans range from adult fashionistas and toy collectors to parents buying the oddly creepy dolls for their toddlers. They may line up at Pop Mart stores and vending machines for hours, even traveling overseas to get their hands on one. Some Labubus go for hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars on resale marketplaces like StockX or eBay. Pop Mart brought in about 13.04 billion yuan ($1.8 billion) in 2024 global revenue, according to the company's most recent annual results announcement. That included the equivalent of approximately $460 million in profits, the announcement said. Roughly $423 million of the company's global revenue came from Labubu dolls alone, says Emily Brough, Pop Mart's head of intellectual property licensing for the Americas. That's a 729% increase from 2023, she adds. ""We've seen an incredible growth in revenue and interest across all of our IP,"" says Brough. ""Labubu certainly hit astronomical numbers last year."" Here's how Labubu went from a simple collectible toy to a viral, money-making sensation. Building a multibillion-dollar brand Pop Mart was founded in 2010 as a small variety shop in Beijing, China. Its founder, Wang Ning — now 38 — had a knack for retail as an advertising student in college, where he'd sell accessories to his classmates, according to Bloomberg. The business grew steadily, opening another retail store at a mall in 2011 and an online store in 2016. Pop Mart regularly partnered with artists to design and create different toys and figurines, and in 2019, it struck such a deal with artist Kasing Lung, who illustrated a picture book series called ""The Monsters."" Labubu is a character from ""The Monsters,"" and Pop Mart's first wave of Labubu dolls ""broke the [business'] sales record in the art toy category,"" according to the company's website. A year later, Pop Mart started trading publicly in Hong Kong at a $6.9 billion valuation, putting the company within range of international toymakers like Mattel and Hasbro. Shoppers queue at a Pop Mart vending machine to buy collectibles in New Jersey's American Dream Mall. Ashton Jackson In 2023, Pop Mart started selling versions of Labubus with keyrings attached to them. Then, in April 2024, Lalisa ""Lisa"" Manoban, member of the K-Pop band Blackpink, was spotted with a Labubu on her purse as a bag charm. She unknowingly started a frenzy, as people flocked to get their own monster toy accessory — quickly turning Pop Mart's dolls into a fashion accessory and symbol of social status. Celebrities like Lizzo and billionaire Rihanna put Labubus on their own purses, further popularizing the toy. People customize their dolls, giving them hats, ""designer"" outfits, sunglasses and their own purses. Some people even put real tattoos on their Labubus' faces. Pop Mart's market cap is now $43.28 billion, as of Monday afternoon — far outpacing Mattel's $6.44 billion and Hasbro's $10.63 billion. We're 'building a brand for longevity' The vast majority of Pop Mart's revenue comes from Asia — $1.6 billion in 2024, including $1.1 billion from mainland China alone. Still, Labubus now have hundreds of thousands of fans across the world, including 145,000 ""Monsters"" in Reddit's Labubu community, for example. Pop Mart's 500-plus stores worldwide include more than 90 retail locations in the United States, including vending machines, according to its website. The company's success has pushed Ning's estimated net worth to $21.6 billion, says Forbes. Some Labubu fans say their affection for the plush monsters goes well beyond celebrity influence: They love the unique-looking toys, the personalities Lung created for them and the thrill of trying to get a specific Labubu for their collections. Pop Mart's 2024 revenue by region. CNBC Make It Pop Mart's limited supply has reportedly led to customers fighting over Labubus. Rising resale prices have created a market for knockoff Labubus, known as ""Lafufus,"" on platforms like Amazon and AliExpress. Fashion and pop culture trends don't tend to last forever, meaning Labubu dolls could fade in popularity over time. For now, Pop Mart plans to keep expanding internationally — taking advantage of the craze while it exists — and growing its roster of artists to create and sell more characters, says Brough. ""Pop Mart has been around for 15 years and we are really building a brand for longevity,"" she says. ""As we continue to diversify our artists' portfolio and diversify the ways that people can really interact with our characters, we will continue our mission to light up passion and bring joy for years to come.""

mov_2DA7559BDAB571821FBB562BE42B7977,"  Innovator Olga Osokina on how AI has changed the relationship between consumers and brands, why emotional reactions matter, and what makes the Labubu case worth studying. In recent years, the global trend toward conscious consumption has gained momentum. In 2025, its popularity surged—tens of thousands of people joined the No Buy 2025 initiative, aiming to go a year without impulsive or irrational purchases. And while this trend has a positive impact on the environment and mental health, it poses a challenge for businesses: traditional sales tools are losing effectiveness, and the cost of customer acquisition is rising rapidly. Olga Osokina, CEO of UME Tech, has developed a fundamentally new approach to working with consumer behavior. She explores the intersections of artificial and biological intelligence, integrating neurobehavioral analytics and cognitive architecture into marketing, sales, and product development. Olga is the winner of Innovator of the Year (International Business Award), Entrepreneur of the Year (Stevie Awards), and Innovation Leader of the Year (Global Innovation Online Awards, 2025). She also served as a judge at the Consumer Electronics Show alongside representatives from Meta, Amazon, and Netflix. Previously, Olga founded Mirri—a sensory learning platform for children with autism spectrum disorders. The results of its use were presented at several scientific-practical conferences, including those on inclusive education. This experience became the starting point for developing the biointelligence model in the business environment. From Emotions to Decision-Making Neuropatterns Olga Osokina notes that for a long time, marketing relied on the ""wow effect""—the drive to trigger a strong emotional response. But today, that's no longer enough: ""The modern consumer's brain has become 'immune' to one-sided stimuli. To achieve engagement, we need to understand how the brain processes emotions, visual signals, and price anchors. What works best is an emotional sine wave, a sequence of shifting states where peaks of interest alternate with relaxation and doubt. This dynamic is what activates conscious decisions, not impulses."" Under Olga's leadership, the UME Tech team conducted a series of behavioral tests involving 214 users in an e-commerce setting. During the experiment, the following were tracked: glucose levels via CGM (continuous glucose monitoring), neural activation through wearable sensors, behavioral data: clicks, scroll depth, response speed, and CTA choices. The study was carried out in 2024 in partnership with experts in behavioral economics and neurophysiology. The pilot was not a clinical trial and was not intended for medical diagnosis; the goal was to validate hypotheses about how emotional scenarios influence behavioral engagement and motivation to act. All data was anonymized and collected in accordance with internal ethical standards of UX analytics. ""We found that when an emotional scenario is built on contrast—for example, an anxious audio background at the start followed by a visually warm scene—engagement increases by 23–26%. And not due to impulse, but due to internal confirmation of choice,"" Olga emphasizes. AI as a Barrier: How the Brain Resists Algorithms Olga stresses that AI technologies, intended to enhance communication, are increasingly triggering subconscious resistance among consumers: ""People intuitively sense when content is generated by an algorithm rather than a human. The sales funnel stops working, even if the communication appears personalized."" Osokina's team developed neuro-oriented engagement scenarios based on cognitive rhythm—not aggressive swings, but a deliberate activation of trust. This creates the sense of ""I made this decision myself,"" instead of ""I was manipulated."" Digital Avatars and Neuro-Negotiation in B2B In 2024, UME Tech introduced AI-avatar technology—digital brand ambassadors adapted to the audience's psychotype and cultural context. At launch, they helped companies nearly eliminate costs for paid audience acquisition. ""Later we scaled this approach to the B2B sector. By applying speech dynamics patterns, visual trust markers, and negotiation tempo, we helped clients increase average contract value by 15–20%,"" Olga shares. The Labubu Case: Not a Product, but a Symptom of the Environment This case is presented not as a pop culture reference but as an example of how a product can resonate with the audience on a cultural and neural level. Labubu demonstrates how a brand can become an interface of cultural tension. As Olga Osokina notes, its image is built on the principle of semantic incompleteness: it's both cute and strange, fluffy and toothy. This activates a projection mechanism—the consumer fills in the meaning themselves, triggering the effect of an unfinished gestalt. Combined with a scarcity model (limited releases, exclusive collaborations), this creates predictive coding of desire. The toy tapped into already-heated themes—mental health, the inner child, and kidult culture—and became a neurosymbol of returning to oneself. Even the packaging became part of the engagement: an ASMR effect when opening, minimalist visual encoding, tactile material—all of which activate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain associated with intuitive confidence.

mov_55304E4837BBB76F230A4E2D4BF6552A,"  Innovator Olga Osokina on how AI has changed the relationship between consumers and brands, why emotional reactions matter, and what makes the Labubu case worth studying. In recent years, the global trend toward conscious consumption has gained momentum. In 2025, its popularity surged—tens of thousands of people joined the No Buy 2025 initiative, aiming to go a year without impulsive or irrational purchases. And while this trend has a positive impact on the environment and mental health, it poses a challenge for businesses: traditional sales tools are losing effectiveness, and the cost of customer acquisition is rising rapidly. Olga Osokina, CEO of UME Tech, has developed a fundamentally new approach to working with consumer behavior. She explores the intersections of artificial and biological intelligence, integrating neurobehavioral analytics and cognitive architecture into marketing, sales, and product development. Olga is the winner of Innovator of the Year (International Business Award), Entrepreneur of the Year (Stevie Awards), and Innovation Leader of the Year (Global Innovation Online Awards, 2025). She also served as a judge at the Consumer Electronics Show alongside representatives from Meta, Amazon, and Netflix. Previously, Olga founded Mirri—a sensory learning platform for children with autism spectrum disorders. The results of its use were presented at several scientific-practical conferences, including those on inclusive education. This experience became the starting point for developing the biointelligence model in the business environment. From Emotions to Decision-Making Neuropatterns Olga Osokina notes that for a long time, marketing relied on the “wow effect”—the drive to trigger a strong emotional response. But today, that's no longer enough: “The modern consumer's brain has become 'immune' to one-sided stimuli. To achieve engagement, we need to understand how the brain processes emotions, visual signals, and price anchors. What works best is an emotional sine wave, a sequence of shifting states where peaks of interest alternate with relaxation and doubt. This dynamic is what activates conscious decisions, not impulses.” Under Olga's leadership, the UME Tech team conducted a series of behavioral tests involving 214 users in an e-commerce setting. During the experiment, the following were tracked: glucose levels via CGM (continuous glucose monitoring), neural activation through wearable sensors, behavioral data: clicks, scroll depth, response speed, and CTA choices. The study was carried out in 2024 in partnership with experts in behavioral economics and neurophysiology. The pilot was not a clinical trial and was not intended for medical diagnosis; the goal was to validate hypotheses about how emotional scenarios influence behavioral engagement and motivation to act. All data was anonymized and collected in accordance with internal ethical standards of UX analytics. “We found that when an emotional scenario is built on contrast—for example, an anxious audio background at the start followed by a visually warm scene—engagement increases by 23–26%. And not due to impulse, but due to internal confirmation of choice,” Olga emphasizes. AI as a Barrier: How the Brain Resists Algorithms Olga stresses that AI technologies, intended to enhance communication, are increasingly triggering subconscious resistance among consumers: “People intuitively sense when content is generated by an algorithm rather than a human. The sales funnel stops working, even if the communication appears personalized.” Osokina's team developed neuro-oriented engagement scenarios based on cognitive rhythm—not aggressive swings, but a deliberate activation of trust. This creates the sense of “I made this decision myself,” instead of “I was manipulated.” Digital Avatars and Neuro-Negotiation in B2B In 2024, UME Tech introduced AI-avatar technology—digital brand ambassadors adapted to the audience's psychotype and cultural context. At launch, they helped companies nearly eliminate costs for paid audience acquisition. “Later we scaled this approach to the B2B sector. By applying speech dynamics patterns, visual trust markers, and negotiation tempo, we helped clients increase average contract value by 15–20%,” Olga shares. The Labubu Case: Not a Product, but a Symptom of the Environment This case is presented not as a pop culture reference but as an example of how a product can resonate with the audience on a cultural and neural level. Labubu demonstrates how a brand can become an interface of cultural tension. As Olga Osokina notes, its image is built on the principle of semantic incompleteness: it's both cute and strange, fluffy and toothy. This activates a projection mechanism—the consumer fills in the meaning themselves, triggering the effect of an unfinished gestalt. Combined with a scarcity model (limited releases, exclusive collaborations), this creates predictive coding of desire. The toy tapped into already-heated themes—mental health, the inner child, and kidult culture—and became a neurosymbol of returning to oneself. Even the packaging became part of the engagement: an ASMR effect when opening, minimalist visual encoding, tactile material—all of which activate the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the area of the brain associated with intuitive confidence. “Labubu is not hype—it's an environmental marker.

596a94d9f906f3bcc7787329203c4c78,"  What Are Labubu Dolls? Labubu dolls are collectible vinyl and plush toys known for their mischievous monster-elf appearance. With oversized eyes, pointed ears, and jagged teeth, Labubu embodies a quirky blend of creepy and cute. The toys are sold in blind boxes, meaning each figure is a surprise, increasing their collectibility and emotional thrill for buyers. Who Created Labubu and When Did It Begin? Labubu was created in 2015 by Kasing Lung, a Hong Kong-born, Belgium-based artist. Originally featured in his storybook series The Monsters, Labubu was later transformed into a toy phenomenon when Chinese brand Pop Mart licensed it in 2019. The company popularised the character through its global blind-box toy model. Why Did Labubu Dolls Go Viral? The turning point came in early 2024 when BLACKPINK's Lisa was spotted with a Labubu keychain. That one sighting ignited a wave of interest. Soon, global icons like Rihanna, Dua Lipa, and David Beckham were seen with Labubu-themed items. Social media amplified the trend, with TikTok and Instagram filled with unboxings, DIY setups, and fan-made stories. The toy's viral status was propelled by three main factors: • Celebrity visibility • The addictive thrill of mystery-box unboxing • Limited availability creating a scarcity loop How Much Do Labubu Dolls Cost? Standard Labubu figures retail in India and abroad for ₹800 to ₹2,500. Larger or special editions can start at ₹10,000. However, in the resale and auction markets, prices have reached jaw-dropping figures. A 4-foot Labubu statue recently sold for ₹1.25 crore in China. Another limited-edition version fetched over $170,000. Where to Buy Labubu Dolls in India? While Pop Mart has no official stores in India yet, collectors can get Labubu dolls through multiple channels: • Pop Mart Global Online Store: Ships internationally, including to India • Amazon India and Flipkart: Occasionally list blind-box series • Indian retailers like The Comic Store, Hamleys Online, and Mech Mocha • Instagram resellers and hobby auctions (buyers must verify authenticity) Why Are They So Expensive and Addictive? Labubu dolls are designed to trigger emotional attachment and consumer excitement. The blind-box format mimics the unpredictability of slot machines. Add rare editions and limited runs, and each box becomes a collector's gamble. Many Labubu buyers are adult collectors—part of the rising “kidult” trend—who treat these toys as both emotional and investment assets. The Cultural Power of Labubu Labubu's “ugly-cute” aesthetic taps into a niche that blends horror with affection. On TikTok, the hashtag #Labubu has crossed over 1.7 million videos. Fans make miniature homes, accessories, and even fan-fiction. It has evolved from a toy into a digital-age collectible obsession. Despite controversies—including bizarre claims linking Labubu's design to demonic symbols—the toy's popularity is unshaken. In 2025, Labubu isn't just a viral sensation; it's a symbol of how culture, design, and psychology converge to create global consumer frenzies.","What Are Labubu Dolls?

Sie haben große Kulleraugen, Hasenohren, ein böses Grinsen und spitze Zähne – Labubus sind niedlich und hässlich zugleich. In China sind die Fellmonster schon lange angesagt. Jetzt ist der Hype auch nach Deutschland geschwappt – befeuert von etlichen Influencerinnen und Influencern, die sich beim Auspacken der Überraschungsboxen filmen. Der chinesische Hersteller und Händler Pop Mart wird am 25. Juli in Berlin sein erstes Geschäft hierzulande eröffnen. Wird der Labubu-Trend länger bleiben? Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger. Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mit Hilfe dessen man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit dem man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte. Labubus: Trend-„Modeaccessoire“ mit Erwachsenen als Zielgruppe Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrößten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. „Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer. Labubus sind ein Modeaccessoire, ein Statement. “ Gerne werden diese gut sichtbar an der Handtasche getragen – und kosten auf der offiziellen Pop Mart-Seite ab etwa 19 Euro. In China reicht die Preisspanne in den Läden von 66 Yuan (knapp 7,90 Euro) bis 1299 Yuan (knapp 155 Euro). Losgetreten hatten den Hype in den USA und Europa laut Ulrich Stars wie Rihanna, Madonna oder Dua Lipa, die sich mit Labububs in der Öffentlichkeit zeigten. Der Münchner Trendforscher Axel Dammler meint: Genau dafür seien die Figuren gedacht. „Die will ich zeigen. “ Um zu demonstrieren, dass man ein Trendsetter sei und es einem gelungen sei, eins der begehrten Exemplare zu ergattern. Labubu-Hype in Berlin: Pop-up-Store verkauft bald die beliebten Plüschtiere Bald soll das auch in Deutschland einfacher möglich sein: Ulrich zufolge sind insgesamt drei Geschäfte geplant, eines davon im Einkaufszentrum Alexa in Berlin. „Seit Wochen fiebern die Fans dem Eröffnungstag entgegen“, teilt Center Manager Oliver Hanna mit. Das Einkaufszentrum bereite sich auf einem Ansturm vor. Los geht es am Freitag, 25. Juli, im Alexa Berlin am Alexanderplatz: Im Erdgeschoss soll der Pop-up-Store errichtet werden. Das Einkaufszentrum öffnet um 10 Uhr. Dass der Laden bei Touristen gut ankommen wird, steht für Dammler außer Frage – vor allem bei jungen Leuten, die über die sozialen Medien auf die Labubus aufmerksam geworden sind. Während eines Berlin-Trips könnten sie sich dort mit außergewöhnlichen Souvenirs eindecken und Selfies knipsen, um diese den Daheimgeblieben zu schicken, meint der Trendforscher. Labubus werde man in dem Berliner Laden wahrscheinlich dennoch nur für kurze Zeit bekommen, erwartet Ulrich. Konzept ist schließlich Konzept. Labubus ergattern: Auch online sind die Wesen schnell ausverkauft Gerade in China wollen viele Menschen zeigen, dass sie die seltenen Plüschwesen ergattern konnten: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter große Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der „The Monsters“-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen.

比Labubu更醜萌？ Fuggler靠搞怪外型與放屁音效爆紅",SPR_COMBO[zh-tw]「泡泡瑪特」的公仔Labubu，在全球引發搶購熱潮，粉絲砸大錢買盲盒，就是為了抽種自己喜歡的款式，這種「盲盒機制」容易讓人上癮，粉絲為了搶購，時常大打出手。 市面出現不少品質低劣的山寨A貨。 儘管負面新聞多，「泡泡瑪特」仍賺飽荷包，去年全球營收高達528億台幣，創辦人「王寧」還擠身大陸10大富豪。 Labubu公仔的成功關鍵在於其獨特的「醜萌」外觀和泡泡瑪特的行銷策略。 每個盲盒約售30美元（台幣878元），而真人大小的Labubu娃娃曾在北京拍賣會上以超過17萬美元（台幣498萬）成交。 泡泡瑪特粉絲Dillon Reed表示，這些公仔很醜但又可愛，讓人忍不住想收藏。 另一位粉絲Kara Ng承認自己已經擁有八、九個Labubu，花費約150至200美元（台幣4400至5850元）在收藏上，而Reed甚至表示自己已花費上千美元購買這些公仔。 中國大陸玩具商泡泡瑪特，用15年的時間，從北京一間文創小店發跡，如今已是全球流行帝國，銷售通路遍及五大洲，包括網購、實體店和自動販賣機。 去年公司營收達18億美元，海外營收占四成，其中港澳台日韓約10%，東南亞18%，北美不到6%但成長迅速。 2025年第一季美國市場營收，已經超過2024年整年營收。 光是Labubu本身就有上百種版本造型，每一種都是來自全球不同的藝術家設計，不斷推出新款式，維持新鮮感，也引起粉絲的競奪、比較心態。 泡泡瑪特北美區知識產權授權主管Emily Brough強調，每一件產品都是與藝術家合作的成果。 The Toy Insider副總編Samantha Connell指出，這種模式讓粉絲很容易花更多錢，不斷回來購買更多產品。 盲盒機制是泡泡瑪特成功的另一關鍵。 每個Labubu盲盒中有機會獲得七種不同角色，包括隱藏和稀有版。 Kara Ng形容盲盒「很危險，非常危險」，因為當拿到想要的款式時會感到興奮，若沒拿到就會想再買。 Dillon Reed將搶購Labubu比喻為「第四次世界大戰」，他擁有帶翅膀的訂制款和LV版的Labubu。 隨著Labubu熱潮擴散，市場上也出現品質低劣的仿冒品「Lafufu」，外觀與正版差異不大，讓粉絲難以分辨。 此外，北京當局也開始關注盲盒成癮問題，今年6月起加強監管，禁止向8歲以下兒童出售盲盒，導致泡泡瑪特股價一週內崩跌10%。 儘管如此，泡泡瑪特在香港股市上市5年來，今年股價已上漲190%，市值達433億美元，遠超孩之寶的106億美元和美泰兒的64億美元，顯示這股「醜萌」風潮的商業潛力仍然強大。 更多 TVBS 報導 泡泡瑪特股價開始暴跌!

mov_6B36F311764FE0966ECB63BCCDE2EC7C,"  It is the year 2025 & AIs are silently sneaking into our lives. Be it CHATGPT or GROK or anything else, we are being touched by the presence of Artificial Intelligence. The very ambitious human wants to control his/ her environment, and that has somehow made many of us addicted to the most important gadget in our lives, the phone! Yes, we all want to be on top of things, and hence, we keep ourselves immersed in wanting to know what is happening around all of us. Be it opinions, be it news, be it a viral trend, or a crappy piece of information about a not-so-cute-looking doll( aka labubu dolls), the moment we receive the information, our mind accepts it as a treasure. I read in an article today that we do not need so much information to survive. Rather, an overload of information can, in fact, have a very negative impact on our minds. Our brains have a tendency to focus on negativity rather than positivity. It is called as negative bias of the brain. For example, we are prone to be hurt by one criticism and ignore ten compliments that we might have received. We are eager to be drawn to negative reviews rather than believing good reviews about a project. And sometimes, our overexposure to the outside world can make us feel empty within. Life may seem hazardous and meaningless when we get exposed to gruesome news of murders happening in our society. A little moment of boredom can make us feel like we are missing out, or we might develop this attitude that we need to be doing something ( even if it means constant scrolling on our phones) rather than enjoying the present moment. Talking about myself, I have found that a little rejection demoralised me so much that it has been a couple of months since I have actually written something meaningful. But then, isn't rejection part of the writing journey? We all know the answer is yes. But can we deny that the coping mechanism and the period to bounce back are different for all? No, we can not. It is simple. People are different, and hence their responses to different phenomena are different too. I have been honestly feeling a little demotivated for quite some time, and probably the impostor syndrome had hit me so hard that I had lost all interest in creating beauty with written words. And I had no one to open up to! Some battles have to be fought alone. And in this lonely phase, I got trapped in this never-ending loop of scrolling my phone, consuming content mindlessly rather than creating. I  lost interest in reading a book, let alone writing my heart out! Starting a season on Netflix/ Amazon Prime seemed like a task rather than an enjoyment. All this while I had been not liking myself, but I could do little. One night, I had this very uneasy feeling where everything just started spinning so fast that I felt like throwing up! It had similar symptoms to vertigo, but not exactly the same. I panicked because this kind of disease makes you dependent on another person & I did not want that. I got myself checked, and to my relief, it was just a case of low BP, vitamin D deficiency & some minor issues. The doctor prescribed me medicines while cautioning that I need not stress more. I know life can be hard, and a little stress is inevitable. But  I was probably feeling anxious due to my FOMO syndrome. I indeed love being on top of things. I feel out of place if I do not know what Gen Z is into these days. I had probably let myself get affected by the rant threads on X or compared my body size with the perfect-looking divas on Instagram ( even though I am aware of the edit features)! I can not pinpoint an exact reason, but all this while I have been cursing myself for not being able to publish my next book, or write a blog post / a book review, or the least read a book. I knew I needed help. But it is I who has to help myself, & hence  I took to art to revive my spirit in creativity & to generally uplift my mood. While taking my medications, I have promised myself to take it slow & not seek validation in terms of acceptance of my writing as a symbol of me being able to write. I shall write for the simple joy of writing & read for the simple joy of reading. I have mindfully refrained from any blog hops and taken the pressure of reading everyone's posts & commenting. I enjoy all of this. But not now. I just need to be myself. And most importantly, I am happy to declare that making a piece of art daily gives me happiness. I have named this project as my "" Daily Art Therapy,"" & this therapy isn't as expensive as others! wink wink!...","It is the year 2025 & AIs are silently sneaking into our lives.

We are eager to be drawn to negative reviews rather than believing good reviews about a project. And sometimes, our overexposure to the outside world can make us feel empty within. Life may seem hazardous and meaningless when we get exposed to gruesome news of murders happening in our society. A little moment of boredom can make us feel like we are missing out, or we might develop this attitude that we need to be doing something ( even if it means constant scrolling on our phones) rather than enjoying the present moment. Talking about myself, I have found that a little rejection demoralised me so much that it has been a couple of months since I have actually written something meaningful. But then, isn't rejection part of the writing journey? We all know the answer is yes. But can we deny that the coping mechanism and the period to bounce back are different for all? No, we can not. It is simple. People are different, and hence their responses to different phenomena are different too. I have been honestly feeling a little demotivated for quite some time, and probably the impostor syndrome had hit me so hard that I had lost all interest in creating beauty with written words. And I had no one to open up to! Some battles have to be fought alone. And in this lonely phase, I got trapped in this never-ending loop of scrolling my phone, consuming content mindlessly rather than creating. I lost interest in reading a book, let alone writing my heart out! Starting a season on Netflix/ Amazon Prime seemed like a task rather than an enjoyment. All this while I had been not liking myself, but I could do little. One night, I had this very uneasy feeling where everything just started spinning so fast that I felt like throwing up! It had similar symptoms to vertigo, but not exactly the same. I panicked because this kind of disease makes you dependent on another person & I did not want that. I got myself checked, and to my relief, it was just a case of low BP, vitamin D deficiency & some minor issues. The doctor prescribed me medicines while cautioning that I need not stress more. I know life can be hard, and a little stress is inevitable. But I was probably feeling anxious due to my FOMO syndrome. I indeed love being on top of things. I feel out of place if I do not know what Gen Z is into these days. I had probably let myself get affected by the rant threads on X or compared my body size with the perfect-looking divas on Instagram ( even though I am aware of the edit features)! I can not pinpoint an exact reason, but all this while I have been cursing myself for not being able to publish my next book, or write a blog post / a book review, or the least read a book. I knew I needed help. But it is I who has to help myself, & hence I took to art to revive my spirit in creativity & to generally uplift my mood. While taking my medications, I have promised myself to take it slow & not seek validation in terms of acceptance of my writing as a symbol of me being able to write. I shall write for the simple joy of writing & read for the simple joy of reading. I have mindfully refrained from any blog hops and taken the pressure of reading everyone's posts & commenting. I enjoy all of this. But not now. I just need to be myself. And most importantly, I am happy to declare that making a piece of art daily gives me happiness.

According to David's Bridal, brides are seeking Labubu looks to match their wedding gowns as a unique keepsake. Couples are also using the little creatures as props for photos and as gifts for their wedding party members. The Pop Mart website describes Labubus as being ""a devilish but cute monster with pointed ears, a charmingly mischievous smile, and very sharp teeth."" The collectible toys, which are often sold in blind bags, can be hooked to purses and bags as accessories and charms. Labubus were immediately popular when launched in 2019, but they became an even bigger sensation after pop star Lisa of BLACKPINK was photographed accessorizing with one in 2024.

The Chinese toy company behind Labubu a snarling, big-eared plush that looks like a cross between a gremlin and a fever dream is projecting profit to jump at least 350% for the first half of the year. Revenue is expected to climb more than 200%. Behind the numbers: an unstoppable global appetite for these quirky collectibles, turbocharged by celebrity fans like Rihanna and BlackPink's Lisa. Pop Mart says tighter cost control has helped too, but make no mistake it's Labubu mania that's fueling this rocket. What started as a niche craze in China has turned into a global retail frenzy. Pop Mart's Hong Kong-listed shares have exploded 588% over the past 12 months, lifting the company's market cap north of $40 billion. At the center of this surge is Labubu, now a pop culture phenomenon with some figures commanding up to $150,000 at auction. Western markets are finally catching on, and Pop Mart is seizing the moment not just as a toymaker, but as a serious global brand with cult-level pricing power. And margins? Pop Mart is in rare air. Last year, it posted a gross margin close to 67%, putting it far ahead of Miniso (NYSE:MNSO) (45%) and leagues beyond Xiaomi and BYD (BYDDF) (around 20%). That kind of profitability is almost unheard of for a consumer brand going global out of China. For investors, the question now isn't whether Pop Mart is growing it's how long this Labubu craze can hold, and whether it's building a long-term brand or just riding a collectible wave.

It seems people consider attacking users personally for using a modality to create an artistic expression more important than discussing the issue at hand. And it seems to be a growing subculture of hostility toward these expressions that gives me pause to contribute anything at all.

Pop Mart is now worth more than the makers of Barbie, Hello Kitty, and Transformers — combined Fueled by surprise toys and celebrity-backed collectibles, the Chinese blind box toy giant just hit a new high. Chinese brands taking on global heavyweights is hardly new — just look at Temu vs. Amazon; Starbucks' struggles with Luckin; BYD edging past Tesla; and $1 tea chain Mixue, which has more stores than McDonald's. Now, that phenomenon has reached the toy aisle. Pop Mart, a 15-year-old Chinese designer toy company, is not-so-quietly taking over the global market, with shoppers willing to wait in line for hours to get their hands on the toothy, mischievous-looking dolls. Its signature blind boxes — sealed packages with random toys inside — have built a loyal, thrill-seeking fan base, driving resale hype through unboxing videos across social media. Anyone familiar with the thrill of chasing that rare Pokémon, or modern video games, where chance rewards from loot boxes have become commonplace, will recognize the playbook instantly. The buying and opening itself is part of the fun. And if you ever make a product where that's true, you know you have an absolute gold mine on your hands. At the center of it all is the Labubu doll, the most sought-after figure in these boxes and a full-blown cultural hit that's selling out worldwide, spotted dangling off the bags of Rihanna and Dua Lipa. THAILAND-BANGKOK-CHINESE ART TOYS Toys themed after Labubu, a popular furry doll from Chinese toy company Pop Mart, are pictured during the opening of a new Pop Mart store in Bangkok, July 2024 (Sun Weitong/Getty Images) Last week, the Labubu craze reached fever pitch with the release of its new edition, Labubu 3.0 — just as Pop Mart reported a more than 165% surge in Q1 revenue. Shares hit an all-time high on Tuesday, adding $1.6 billion to founder Wang Ning's wealth in a single day, and are up ~460% over the past year, making Pop Mart one of the top gainers on the MSCI China Index. After its 2020 Hong Kong IPO, Pop Mart endured a rocky ride, with revenue growth failing to keep pace with its initial buzz. But thanks to the Labubu-fueled rally, the firm's market cap has grown to a staggering $34 billion. That's more than the combined value of Sanrio ($10.2 billion), Hasbro ($8.7 billion), and Mattel ($5.1 billion) — the playtime giants behind Hello Kitty, Transformers, and Barbie, respectively. Driven by curious consumers in China and Southeast Asia, Google Trends data reveals that the volume of searches for “labubu” have now nearly pulled level with the number for “barbie.” So, what's behind the frenzy? To the growing pool of “kidult” customers, Labubu offers a rare mix: collectible fun, luxury-adjacent styling, and more than a hint of childhood nostalgia — making it this generation's Barbiecore, just with sharper teeth. Though Labubu mania is most notably a thing in Southeast Asia, the craze has come to the United States too, with long lines reported in malls around the country. It's also sparked an entire cottage industry. Per The New York Times, creators have started to sell “tiny outfits specifically designed for the dolls, car seats for them to sit in and even little handbags for them to carry.” Tariff toy tantrums Yet the latest wave of tariffs is shaking the industry, especially the whopping 145% levy on China — which produces over 70% of the world's toys and shipped $30 billion in toys and sports equipment to the US last year. According to an April survey by the Toy Association, nearly half of small and mid-sized US toymakers say they may soon shut down because of tariffs, while even Hasbro expects up to a $180 million hit to profits this year. Pop Mart, for now, is faring better. North America is now its fastest-growing region, with revenues up roughly ninefold in Q1. Analysts say the company is better positioned amid trade risks, operating in a premium collectibles market aimed at less price-sensitive adults. Indeed, limited editions for blind boxes can sell at over $250, and go much higher on resale markets. Labubu 3.0 hit the resale platform with a 24% premium, and one rare edition was listed for nearly $2,000 this week, according to Variety. https://sherwood.news/business/pop-mart-worth-more-barbie-hello-kitty-transformers-hasbro-mattel/","SOMEHOW MONEY IS THERE FOR A CRAZE...

英伟达确认 H20 芯片恢复对华销售  
昨日，英伟达发文宣布，将恢复 H20 AI 芯片在中国市场的销售，并计划面向中国推出一款全新、完全兼容的 GPU。 英伟达 CEO 黄仁勋此前面对记者采访时表示：「美国政府已经批准了出口许可可以开始发货了，我们将开始向中国销售 H20。 对此我感到非常高兴，这是个非常好的消息。」 据了解，今年 4 月，美国政府通知，要求英伟达为该芯片申请出口许可。 H20 原本是基于 Hopper 架构、专为中国市场调整的特供版，旨在绕开早前的出口限制。 但随着新规落地，H20 被正式纳入受限清单，出口受阻。 而英伟达也因此损失惨重：已售出的 46 亿美元订单无法发货，外加 25 亿美元的潜在收入也化为泡影。 目前，英伟达官方声明称，美国政府已向英伟达保证将授予许可证，并且英伟达希望尽快启动交付。 与此同时，黄仁勋还宣布推出一款全新且完全兼容的英伟达 RTX PRO GPU，该产品是「为智能工厂和物流打造数字孪生 AI 的理想选择」。 据央视新闻报道，黄仁勋将参加第三届链博会，而他本人昨日在中国贸促会接受记者采访时表示： 
中国市场如此庞大、充满活力。 人工智能在中国发展非常快，我非常高兴看到中国的人工智能发展。 这里有全球 50% 的人工智能研究人员。 因此，美国企业扎根中国市场的确至关重要。 近期还有传闻称，英伟达将在 9 月份向大陆客户提供新的特供版芯片 B20、B30、B40，甚至传闻有云厂客户已经拿到了测试产品。 而据知情人士透露，现在所有特供产品，都要事先报备。 市场上传闻的 B20、B40 这些产品，在 H20 被禁之前内部的确有过讨论，但还没有定论。 另外，7 月 14 日黄仁勋与小米创办人雷军的合照流出，当天北京气温达 35 度，而黄仁勋依旧身穿标志性的皮衣，随后有网友调侃「不怕热」。 而据中国新闻网，当被问及为何大热天穿皮夹克时，黄仁勋表示，「因为西装没来得及干洗，我只有一套西装，还有点被穿坏了。 希望我的皮夹克看起来还行。」 罗马仕召回进度：计划长期有效  
昨日，因近期事件而沉寂多日的罗马仕再次发布声明称，其近期关注到网络上关于罗马仕的大量不实信息，并对此回应。 罗马仕表示，公司从未停止履行承诺，产品召回及售后服务系统按计划持续运转。 对于员工情况，罗马仕方面透露，为了更长远的未来，面对此次运营挑战，公司进行了战略调整，目前运营团队主要成员在岗，将所有可用资源优先投入到用户权益保障中。 另外，罗马仕也对「危险充电宝召回计划」作出承诺：该召回服务长期有效；每一份申请都将得到认真处理；绝不因时间或地域差异影响服务品质。 值得一提的是，日前据我们实际观察和网络信息显示，电商平台的罗马仕旗舰店重新开放。 据老板联播消息，对于店铺重开的情况，罗马仕旗舰店客服表示，目前店铺正在慢慢恢复，后续还会上架其他产品。 近期，罗马仕移动电源（充电宝）产品陷入严重安全危机，罗马仕电商旗舰店曾一度关闭。 6 月，罗马仕召回超 49 万台移动电源。 本月初，罗马仕发布停工停产放假通知，宣布除召回相关员工外，其他员工停工停产 6 个月。 随后更是被爆出目前出问题的产品，大部分都是几年前开发立项的，那时候老板深度参与公司，完全以毛利为导向。 另据知情人士向搜狐科技透露，罗马仕五个最核心的老板，在出事后就基本失联跑去马来西亚了，甚至还多次完成了法人变更。 字节智能眼镜项目曝光  
日前，据 The Information 消息，字节跳动内部正在积极开发一款护目镜形态的「轻量级混合现实设备」，预计将于 2027 年对外公布。 无论是产品功能还是定位，都直直瞄准了 AR 领域风头正盛的 Meta。 据知情人士介绍，字节跳动的这款混合现实（MR）目前仍然处在研发阶段，并未具体透露产品的外观，但是其尺寸「与 Bigscreen 的产品近似」，后者推出的 Bigscreen Beyond 系列号称是目前世界上体积最小的 VR 头显。 虽然目前无从得知这款 MR 产品的具体形态，但是根据业内已有产品的方案，字节跳动大概率采用了显示设备与主机设备分离的设计。 根据知情人士描述，目前版本的设计中这个包含了计算硬件和电池的主机形似一个冰球，需要在使用时与眼镜部分保持数据线连接。 值得一提的是，字节跳动或还会给这个小主机配备一块自主开发的专用芯片，负责处理来自环境传感器的数据，用于减少屏幕上的虚拟内容与背景现实环境之间的迟滞——功能类似苹果在 Vision Pro 中使用的 R1 芯片。 另外，该款 MR 眼镜将由字节旗下的 Pico 团队负责，开发代号「天鹅」（Swan），或许可以看作是 2023 年 Pico 5 项目因为 VR 市场疲软而被取消后，Pico 产品向 MR 领域转型的证据。 泡泡玛特预计业绩暴增超 350%  
7 月 15 日，泡泡玛特国际集团有限公司在港交所发布公告显示： 
预期集团截至 2025 年 6 月 30 日止六个月（本期间）收入可能较去年同期增长不低于 200%；预期本期间集团溢利（不包括未完成统计的金融工具的公允价值变动损益）较去年同期可能录得增长不低于 350%。 该集团董事会认为，泡泡玛特取得上述成绩主要归于以下原因： 
  泡泡玛特品牌及旗下 IP 在全球认可度进一步提升，多样化的产品品类促进集团收入增长，集团各区域市场收入均实现持续高速增长； 
  海外收入占比持续提升，收入结构的变化对毛利、溢利均产生积极影响，同时，规模效应使溢利显著增加； 
  持续优化产品成本，加强费用管控，提升盈利能力。 据多方消息综合，泡泡玛特旗下的「LABUBU」IP 已从一款小众设计师玩偶跃升为国际潮流偶像，与此 IP 有关的产品在全球遭到「疯抢」。 今年 6 月，《时代周刊》发布 2025 年「全球 100 家最具影响力企业」榜单，而泡泡玛特首次入选，并成为首个登榜的中国潮玩企业。 今年 3 月，泡泡玛特公布其 2024 年全年财报显示，营收达 130.4 亿元人民币（同比增长 106.9%），经调整净利润达 34.0 亿元（同比增长 185.9%）。 7 月 15 日，泡泡玛特收盘价为 263.2 港元/股，总市值 3535 亿港元。 机构：二季度全球智能手机出货量下跌  
据数据分析机构 Canalys 最新研究显示，2025 年第二季度，全球智能手机市场同比下滑 1%，这是该行业连续六个季度以来的首次下跌。 研究指出，尽管出货量小幅下降，但这反映出各大厂商在消费者情绪谨慎，全球宏观经济环境不确定性的背景下，整体表现依旧稳定。 具体来看： 
  三星在本季度成功守住了市场领先地位，凭借其 Galaxy A 系列，占据了 19% 的市场份额。 苹果位列第二，占比 16%。 小米本季度表现稳定，占据 15% 的市场份额。 vivo 和传音分别以 9% 的市场份额跻身前五。 宇树科技王兴兴：人形机器人还处在早期阶段

昨日，英伟达发文宣布，将恢复 H20 AI 芯片在中国市场的销售，并计划面向中国推出一款全新、完全兼容的 GPU。 英伟达 CEO 黄仁勋此前面对记者采访时表示：「美国政府已经批准了出口许可可以开始发货了，我们将开始向中国销售 H20。 对此我感到非常高兴，这是个非常好的消息。」 据了解，今年 4 月，美国政府通知，要求英伟达为该芯片申请出口许可。 H20 原本是基于 Hopper 架构、专为中国市场调整的特供版，旨在绕开早前的出口限制。 但随着新规落地，H20 被正式纳入受限清单，出口受阻。 而英伟达也因此损失惨重：已售出的 46 亿美元订单无法发货，外加 25 亿美元的潜在收入也化为泡影。 目前，英伟达官方声明称，美国政府已向英伟达保证将授予许可证，并且英伟达希望尽快启动交付。 与此同时，黄仁勋还宣布推出一款全新且完全兼容的英伟达 RTX PRO GPU，该产品是「为智能工厂和物流打造数字孪生 AI 的理想选择」。 据央视新闻报道，黄仁勋将参加第三届链博会，而他本人昨日在中国贸促会接受记者采访时表示： 
中国市场如此庞大、充满活力。 人工智能在中国发展非常快，我非常高兴看到中国的人工智能发展。 这里有全球 50% 的人工智能研究人员。 因此，美国企业扎根中国市场的确至关重要。 近期还有传闻称，英伟达将在 9 月份向大陆客户提供新的特供版芯片 B20、B30、B40，甚至传闻有云厂客户已经拿到了测试产品。 而据知情人士透露，现在所有特供产品，都要事先报备。 市场上传闻的 B20、B40 这些产品，在 H20 被禁之前内部的确有过讨论，但还没有定论。 另外，7 月 14 日黄仁勋与小米创办人雷军的合照流出，当天北京气温达 35 度，而黄仁勋依旧身穿标志性的皮衣，随后有网友调侃「不怕热」。 而据中国新闻网，当被问及为何大热天穿皮夹克时，黄仁勋表示，「因为西装没来得及干洗，我只有一套西装，还有点被穿坏了。 希望我的皮夹克看起来还行。」 罗马仕召回进度：计划长期有效 
昨日，因近期事件而沉寂多日的罗马仕再次发布声明称，其近期关注到网络上关于罗马仕的大量不实信息，并对此回应。 罗马仕表示，公司从未停止履行承诺，产品召回及售后服务系统按计划持续运转。 对于员工情况，罗马仕方面透露，为了更长远的未来，面对此次运营挑战，公司进行了战略调整，目前运营团队主要成员在岗，将所有可用资源优先投入到用户权益保障中。 另外，罗马仕也对「危险充电宝召回计划」作出承诺：该召回服务长期有效；每一份申请都将得到认真处理；绝不因时间或地域差异影响服务品质。 值得一提的是，日前据我们实际观察和网络信息显示，电商平台的罗马仕旗舰店重新开放。 据老板联播消息，对于店铺重开的情况，罗马仕旗舰店客服表示，目前店铺正在慢慢恢复，后续还会上架其他产品。 近期，罗马仕移动电源（充电宝）产品陷入严重安全危机，罗马仕电商旗舰店曾一度关闭。 6 月，罗马仕召回超 49 万台移动电源。 本月初，罗马仕发布停工停产放假通知，宣布除召回相关员工外，其他员工停工停产 6 个月。 随后更是被爆出目前出问题的产品，大部分都是几年前开发立项的，那时候老板深度参与公司，完全以毛利为导向。 另据知情人士向搜狐科技透露，罗马仕五个最核心的老板，在出事后就基本失联跑去马来西亚了，甚至还多次完成了法人变更。 字节智能眼镜项目曝光 
日前，据 The Information 消息，字节跳动内部正在积极开发一款护目镜形态的「轻量级混合现实设备」，预计将于 2027 年对外公布。 无论是产品功能还是定位，都直直瞄准了 AR 领域风头正盛的 Meta。 据知情人士介绍，字节跳动的这款混合现实（MR）目前仍然处在研发阶段，并未具体透露产品的外观，但是其尺寸「与 Bigscreen 的产品近似」，后者推出的 Bigscreen Beyond 系列号称是目前世界上体积最小的 VR 头显。 虽然目前无从得知这款 MR 产品的具体形态，但是根据业内已有产品的方案，字节跳动大概率采用了显示设备与主机设备分离的设计。 根据知情人士描述，目前版本的设计中这个包含了计算硬件和电池的主机形似一个冰球，需要在使用时与眼镜部分保持数据线连接。 值得一提的是，字节跳动或还会给这个小主机配备一块自主开发的专用芯片，负责处理来自环境传感器的数据，用于减少屏幕上的虚拟内容与背景现实环境之间的迟滞——功能类似苹果在 Vision Pro 中使用的 R1 芯片。 另外，该款 MR 眼镜将由字节旗下的 Pico 团队负责，开发代号「天鹅」（Swan），或许可以看作是 2023 年 Pico 5 项目因为 VR 市场疲软而被取消后，Pico 产品向 MR 领域转型的证据。 泡泡玛特预计业绩暴增超 350% 
7 月 15 日，泡泡玛特国际集团有限公司在港交所发布公告显示：

据中国网消息，7 月 15 日，宇树科技创始人兼 CEO 王兴兴在参加由国务院新闻办举行的中外记者见面会时，回应了并发表了自己对于 AI 未来走向的看法和观点。...",SPR_COMBO[zh] 英伟达确认 H20 芯片恢复对华销售 罗马仕召回进度：计划长期有效 字节智能眼镜项目曝光 泡泡玛特预计业绩暴增超 350% 宇树科技王兴兴：人形机器人还处在早期阶段 Perplexity CEO：AI 浏览器是我们下一个方向 首款折叠屏 iPhone 成本或超 5000 元 停更 10 年，索尼 RX1R III 发布 问界 M8 纯电版 8 月上市 充电宝将迎来新国标：更严格 萝卜快跑无人出租车推出包天服务，无需驾照 外卖、酒店之后，京东入局医美 加菲将主演「ChatGPT 之父」电影 英伟达确认 H20 芯片恢复对华销售 昨日，英伟达发文宣布，将恢复 H20 AI 芯片在中国市场的销售，并计划面向中国推出一款全新、完全兼容的 GPU。 英伟达 CEO 黄仁勋此前面对记者采访时表示：「美国政府已经批准了出口许可可以开始发货了，我们将开始向中国销售 H20。 对此我感到非常高兴，这是个非常好的消息。」 据了解，今年 4 月，美国政府通知，要求英伟达为该芯片申请出口许可。 H20 原本是基于 Hopper 架构、专为中国市场调整的特供版，旨在绕开早前的出口限制。 但随着新规落地，H20 被正式纳入受限清单，出口受阻。 而英伟达也因此损失惨重：已售出的 46 亿美元订单无法发货，外加 25 亿美元的潜在收入也化为泡影。 目前，英伟达官方声明称，美国政府已向英伟达保证将授予许可证，并且英伟达希望尽快启动交付。 与此同时，黄仁勋还宣布推出一款全新且完全兼容的英伟达 RTX PRO GPU，该产品是「为智能工厂和物流打造数字孪生 AI 的理想选择」。 据央视新闻报道，黄仁勋将参加第三届链博会，而他本人昨日在中国贸促会接受记者采访时表示： 中国市场如此庞大、充满活力。 人工智能在中国发展非常快，我非常高兴看到中国的人工智能发展。 这里有全球 50% 的人工智能研究人员。 因此，美国企业扎根中国市场的确至关重要。 近期还有传闻称，英伟达将在 9 月份向大陆客户提供新的特供版芯片 B20、B30、B40，甚至传闻有云厂客户已经拿到了测试产品。 而据知情人士透露，现在所有特供产品，都要事先报备。 市场上传闻的 B20、B40 这些产品，在 H20 被禁之前内部的确有过讨论，但还没有定论。 另外，7 月 14 日黄仁勋与小米创办人雷军的合照流出，当天北京气温达 35 度，而黄仁勋依旧身穿标志性的皮衣，随后有网友调侃「不怕热」。 而据中国新闻网，当被问及为何大热天穿皮夹克时，黄仁勋表示，「因为西装没来得及干洗，我只有一套西装，还有点被穿坏了。 希望我的皮夹克看起来还行。」 罗马仕召回进度：计划长期有效 昨日，因近期事件而沉寂多日的罗马仕再次发布声明称，其近期关注到网络上关于罗马仕的大量不实信息，并对此回应。 罗马仕表示，公司从未停止履行承诺，产品召回及售后服务系统按计划持续运转。 对于员工情况，罗马仕方面透露，为了更长远的未来，面对此次运营挑战，公司进行了战略调整，目前运营团队主要成员在岗，将所有可用资源优先投入到用户权益保障中。 另外，罗马仕也对「危险充电宝召回计划」作出承诺：该召回服务长期有效；每一份申请都将得到认真处理；绝不因时间或地域差异影响服务品质。 值得一提的是，日前据我们实际观察和网络信息显示，电商平台的罗马仕旗舰店重新开放。 据老板联播消息，对于店铺重开的情况，罗马仕旗舰店客服表示，目前店铺正在慢慢恢复，后续还会上架其他产品。 近期，罗马仕移动电源（充电宝）产品陷入严重安全危机，罗马仕电商旗舰店曾一度关闭。 6 月，罗马仕召回超 49 万台移动电源。 本月初，罗马仕发布停工停产放假通知，宣布除召回相关员工外，其他员工停工停产 6 个月。 随后更是被爆出目前出问题的产品，大部分都是几年前开发立项的，那时候老板深度参与公司，完全以毛利为导向。 另据知情人士向搜狐科技透露，罗马仕五个最核心的老板，在出事后就基本失联跑去马来西亚了，甚至还多次完成了法人变更。 字节智能眼镜项目曝光 日前，据 The Information 消息，字节跳动内部正在积极开发一款护目镜形态的「轻量级混合现实设备」，预计将于 2027 年对外公布。 无论是产品功能还是定位，都直直瞄准了 AR 领域风头正盛的 Meta。 据知情人士介绍，字节跳动的这款混合现实（MR）目前仍然处在研发阶段，并未具体透露产品的外观，但是其尺寸「与 Bigscreen 的产品近似」，后者推出的 Bigscreen Beyond 系列号称是目前世界上体积最小的 VR 头显。 虽然目前无从得知这款 MR 产品的具体形态，但是根据业内已有产品的方案，字节跳动大概率采用了显示设备与主机设备分离的设计。 根据知情人士描述，目前版本的设计中这个包含了计算硬件和电池的主机形似一个冰球，需要在使用时与眼镜部分保持数据线连接。 值得一提的是，字节跳动或还会给这个小主机配备一块自主开发的专用芯片，负责处理来自环境传感器的数据，用于减少屏幕上的虚拟内容与背景现实环境之间的迟滞——功能类似苹果在 Vision Pro 中使用的 R1 芯片。 另外，该款 MR 眼镜将由字节旗下的 Pico 团队负责，开发代号「天鹅」（Swan），或许可以看作是 2023 年 Pico 5 项目因为 VR 市场疲软而被取消后，Pico 产品向 MR 领域转型的证据。 泡泡玛特预计业绩暴增超 350% 7 月 15 日，泡泡玛特国际集团有限公司在港交所发布公告显示： 预期集团截至 2025 年 6 月 30 日止六个月（本期间）收入可能较去年同期增长不低于 200%；预期本期间集团溢利（不包括未完成统计的金融工具的公允价值变动损益）较去年同期可能录得增长不低于 350%。 该集团董事会认为，泡泡玛特取得上述成绩主要归于以下原因： 泡泡玛特品牌及旗下 IP 在全球认可度进一步提升，多样化的产品品类促进集团收入增长，集团各区域市场收入均实现持续高速增长； 海外收入占比持续提升，收入结构的变化对毛利、溢利均产生积极影响，同时，规模效应使溢利显著增加； 持续优化产品成本，加强费用管控，提升盈利能力。 据多方消息综合，泡泡玛特旗下的「LABUBU」IP 已从一款小众设计师玩偶跃升为国际潮流偶像，与此 IP 有关的产品在全球遭到「疯抢」。 今年 6 月，《时代周刊》发布 2025 年「全球 100 家最具影响力企业」榜单，而泡泡玛特首次入选，并成为首个登榜的中国潮玩企业。 今年 3 月，泡泡玛特公布其 2024 年全年财报显示，营收达 130.4 亿元人民币（同比增长 106.9%），经调整净利润达 34.0 亿元（同比增长 185.9%）。 7 月 15 日，泡泡玛特收盘价为 263.2 港元/股，总市值 3535 亿港元。 机构：二季度全球智能手机出货量下跌 据数据分析机构 Canalys 最新研究显示，2025 年第二季度，全球智能手机市场同比下滑 1%，这是该行业连续六个季度以来的首次下跌。 研究指出，尽管出货量小幅下降，但这反映出各大厂商在消费者情绪谨慎，全球宏观经济环境不确定性的背景下，整体表现依旧稳定。 具体来看： 三星在本季度成功守住了市场领先地位，凭借其 Galaxy A 系列，占据了 19% 的市场份额。 苹果位列第二，占比 16%。 小米本季度表现稳定，占据 15% 的市场份额。 vivo 和传音分别以 9% 的市场份额跻身前五。 宇树科技王兴兴：人形机器人还处在早期阶段 据中国网消息，7 月 15 日，宇树科技创始人兼 CEO 王兴兴在参加由国务院新闻办举行的中外记者见面会时，回应了并发表了自己对于 AI 未来走向的看法和观点。...,2025-07-16 02:21:40,zh,WEB,,,,cluster_16,5,False,True,"The comment includes a specific section about Pop Mart's business performance, highlighting the brand's significant growth, international recognition, and the success of its LABUBU IP.

Was hat es damit auf sich? Sie haben große Kulleraugen, Hasenohren, ein böses Grinsen und spitze Zähne - Labubus sind niedlich und hässlich zugleich. In China sind die Fellmonster schon lange angesagt. Jetzt ist der Hype auch nach Deutschland geschwappt - befeuert von etlichen Influencerinnen und Influencern, die sich beim Auspacken der Überraschungsboxen filmen. Der chinesische Hersteller und Händler Pop Mart wird am 25. Juli in Berlin sein erstes Geschäft hierzulande eröffnen. Wird der Labubu-Trend länger bleiben? Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger. Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mit Hilfe dessen man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit dem man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte. Labubu-Figuren: Kein Spielzeug für Kinder, sondern Trend-Accessoire Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrößten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. ,,Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer. Labubus sind ein Modeaccessoire, ein Statement. "" Gerne werden diese gut sichtbar an der Handtasche getragen - und kosten auf der offiziellen Pop Mart-Seite ab etwa 19 Euro. In China reicht die Preisspanne in den Läden von 66 Yuan (knapp 7,90 Euro) bis 1299 Yuan (knapp 155 Euro). Losgetreten hatten den Hype in den USA und Europa laut Ulrich Stars wie Rihanna, Madonna oder Dua Lipa, die sich mit Labububs in der Öffentlichkeit zeigten. Der Münchner Trendforscher Axel Dammler meint: Genau dafür seien die Figuren gedacht. ,,Die will ich zeigen. "" Um zu demonstrieren, dass man ein Trendsetter sei und es einem gelungen sei, eins der begehrten Exemplare zu ergattern. Labubu bei Auktionen: Sammler zahlen Tausende Euro Gerade in China wollen das viele zeigen: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter große Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der ,,The Monsters""-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. ,,Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten"", sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Labubu-Hypes Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging. Eine Anfrage zur Strategie des Unternehmens ließ Pop Mart unbeantwortet. Die Popularität der wertvollen Figuren ließ bereits Fälschungen in Umlauf geraten, die etwa der chinesische Zoll fand. Wer einen Fake erkennen will, kann dem Zoll zufolge die Zähne der Labubus zählen: Die echten hätten immer neun. Zudem schritt die Finanzaufsicht in Teilen Chinas bereits ein, als eine Bank Neukunden mit Labubu-Boxen bei einer Konto-Neueröffnung anwarb. Warum Labubu-Figuren so begehrt sind Dass die Labubus meist schnell ausverkauft seien, gehöre zur Strategie von Pop Mart, sagt Ulrich. ,,Das weckt zusätzliche Begehrlichkeit, wenn man nicht sofort an die Produkte kommt. "" Zum Konzept gehört auch, dass die Labubus oft in der sogenannten Blind Box verkauft werden, bei der man nicht weiß, welches Kuschelmonster sich darin befindet. Box auspacken, gefolgt von schierer Begeisterung oder herber Enttäuschung - auf Instagram und Tiktok kommen solche Clips gut an. Den sogenannten Unboxing-Trend gibt es dort zwar schon länger. Allerdings habe es lange Zeit kein neues Thema mehr dazu gegeben, sagt Dammler. Gleichzeitig passten die Labubus gut zum aktuellen Asien-Trend, den K-Pop-Bands, Anime-Filme und Manga-Comics hierzulande ausgelöst hätten. Wie lange hält der Labubu-Hype? Trotzdem ist Dammler skeptisch, dass die Labubus zum Dauerbrenner werden. ,,Die Hype-Welle ist aufgebaut. Ich denke, dass man sie aktuell gut verkaufen kann. "" Allerdings müssten die Figuren deutlich günstiger werden und besser erhältlich sein, um die breite Masse anzusprechen, sagt der Experte vom Münchner Marktforschungsunternehmen Iconkids & Youth....","SPR_COMBO[de]Überall Erwachsene, die sich etwas schräge Plüschfiguren an die Handtasche hängen: Labubus sind in diesem Sommer der Trend auf Tiktok und Instagram.

Labubu-Figuren: Kein Spielzeug für Kinder, sondern Trend-Accessoire Die Labubus richteten sich dagegen in erster Linie an Frauen, sagt Christian Ulrich, Vorstandssprecher der weltgrößten Spielwarenmesse in Nürnberg. ,,Das ist kein Produkt für das Kinderzimmer. Labubus sind ein Modeaccessoire, ein Statement. "" Gerne werden diese gut sichtbar an der Handtasche getragen - und kosten auf der offiziellen Pop Mart-Seite ab etwa 19 Euro. In China reicht die Preisspanne in den Läden von 66 Yuan (knapp 7,90 Euro) bis 1299 Yuan (knapp 155 Euro). Losgetreten hatten den Hype in den USA und Europa laut Ulrich Stars wie Rihanna, Madonna oder Dua Lipa, die sich mit Labububs in der Öffentlichkeit zeigten. Der Münchner Trendforscher Axel Dammler meint: Genau dafür seien die Figuren gedacht. ,,Die will ich zeigen. "" Um zu demonstrieren, dass man ein Trendsetter sei und es einem gelungen sei, eins der begehrten Exemplare zu ergattern. Labubu bei Auktionen: Sammler zahlen Tausende Euro Gerade in China wollen das viele zeigen: Im Juni bot ein Käufer in Peking bei einer Auktion für eine besonders seltene, etwa 1,30 Meter große Labubu-Einzel-Edition bereits über umgerechnet etwa 118.700 Euro. In China hält der Hype um das Elfenwesen, das der Hongkonger Künstler Kasing Lung 2015 als Teil der ,,The Monsters""-Serie kreierte und das mit einer spärlichen Hintergrund-Geschichte versehen wurde, schon länger an. An den Pop-Mart-Automaten sind die Labubus oft vergriffen. In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. ,,Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten"", sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, so dass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Labubu-Hypes Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging. Eine Anfrage zur Strategie des Unternehmens ließ Pop Mart unbeantwortet. Die Popularität der wertvollen Figuren ließ bereits Fälschungen in Umlauf geraten, die etwa der chinesische Zoll fand. Wer einen Fake erkennen will, kann dem Zoll zufolge die Zähne der Labubus zählen: Die echten hätten immer neun. Zudem schritt die Finanzaufsicht in Teilen Chinas bereits ein, als eine Bank Neukunden mit Labubu-Boxen bei einer Konto-Neueröffnung anwarb. Warum Labubu-Figuren so begehrt sind Dass die Labubus meist schnell ausverkauft seien, gehöre zur Strategie von Pop Mart, sagt Ulrich. ,,Das weckt zusätzliche Begehrlichkeit, wenn man nicht sofort an die Produkte kommt. "" Zum Konzept gehört auch, dass die Labubus oft in der sogenannten Blind Box verkauft werden, bei der man nicht weiß, welches Kuschelmonster sich darin befindet. Box auspacken, gefolgt von schierer Begeisterung oder herber Enttäuschung - auf Instagram und Tiktok kommen solche Clips gut an. Den sogenannten Unboxing-Trend gibt es dort zwar schon länger. Allerdings habe es lange Zeit kein neues Thema mehr dazu gegeben, sagt Dammler. Gleichzeitig passten die Labubus gut zum aktuellen Asien-Trend, den K-Pop-Bands, Anime-Filme und Manga-Comics hierzulande ausgelöst hätten. Wie lange hält der Labubu-Hype? Trotzdem ist Dammler skeptisch, dass die Labubus zum Dauerbrenner werden. ,,Die Hype-Welle ist aufgebaut. Ich denke, dass man sie aktuell gut verkaufen kann. "" Allerdings müssten die Figuren deutlich günstiger werden und besser erhältlich sein, um die breite Masse anzusprechen, sagt der Experte vom Münchner Marktforschungsunternehmen Iconkids & Youth....",2025-07-16 09:47:18,de,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"This is a comprehensive German article specifically about Pop Mart's Labubu toy line, discussing its popularity, cultural significance, collectibility, and market trends.

mov_16F68632F8AA81E754F9D856C3F047C6,"  The mythical Nagamani, a glowing gem from cobras' heads, is deeply rooted in South Asian folklore, promising power and protection. While captivating believers for centuries, science refutes its existence, revealing so-called 'snake pearls' as mere gallstones or mineral concretions. Despite lacking scientific basis, the Nagamani persists as a potent symbol of hidden strength and cultural fascination. Have you ever come across the term ""Snake Pearl"" or ""Nagamani"" and wondered if such a mystical object could truly exist? Rooted in centuries of folklore, especially in South Asia, Nagamani has long captivated believers and skeptics alike. Said to be a rare, glowing gem found in the heads of cobras, this legendary object is often associated with divine power, protection, and fortune. Despite its presence in myths, movies, and spiritual beliefs, scientific investigations tell a very different story. Explore the origins, alleged powers, and controversies surrounding the mythical Nagamani. What is a Nagamani or snake pearl The term Nagamani comes from Sanskrit — where ""Naga"" means snake and ""Mani"" means gem or jewel. According to traditional beliefs, this mystical pearl is said to form inside the head of venomous snakes, most commonly cobras. Legends claim it glows in the dark and bestows immense spiritual and material power to its possessor, including protection from evil, healing powers, and incredible luck. Do cobras really have Nagmanis According to Geology In, the idea that cobras possess a glowing gem called Nagamani in their heads has long fascinated believers across India and Southeast Asia. However, modern science firmly rejects this claim. Biologically, cobras do not have the anatomical ability to form pearls—unlike mollusks. Scientific analyses of so-called ""snake pearls"" reveal they are often gallstones or mineral concretions, not true gemstones. These formations may occur inside snake bodies, but they lack any supernatural properties. The enduring myth of Nagamani stems more from cultural symbolism and folklore than scientific fact, illustrating humanity's deep desire to assign mystery and meaning to nature's creatures. Mythology behind Nagamani or snake pearl In Hindu mythology and regional folklore, snakes are not just reptiles — they're divine beings. Nagas are often worshipped and believed to hold secrets of the universe. The Nagamani is said to be a jewel they guard or possess. Stories often describe snake charmers or ascetics receiving the Nagamani as a reward from a mystical serpent for their devotion. It is also portrayed in temples, mythological texts, and even Bollywood films as a divine, glowing gem of untold power. Spiritual significance: In many cultures, snakes symbolize protection, wisdom, and hidden power. Media influence: Films and TV shows like Naagin have sensationalized Nagamani legends. Oral traditions: The myth is passed down through generations, especially in rural India and Southeast Asia. Symbolism: It serves as a metaphor for hidden strength and the supernatural. Glow in the dark Detect poison Change colour with mood or danger Heal physical or spiritual ailments Attract wealth or good fortune Some even claim that possession of a Nagamani can make someone immortal or allow communication with divine beings. Why modern science debunks the myth of Nagamani Modern herpetologists and gemologists agree on one thing — no biological process supports the existence of a pearl inside a snake's head. Snakes do not have the anatomy to produce pearls, unlike mollusks. Some so-called “snake pearls” examined by scientists have turned out to be gallstones or mineral concretions (similar to kidney stones). These may form naturally around debris inside a snake's body but hold no magical properties.A few specimens presented as “Nagamani” have been analyzed and found to consist of a mix of organic material, calcium, and protein, but none qualify as gems or pearls under scientific standards. The myth of Nagamani holds power beyond science While the physical existence of Nagamani is highly questionable, its cultural power is undeniable. It serves as a symbol of: Hidden strength or divine reward The mystique of nature and the animal world Human fascination with the unknown In this way, Nagamani behaves more like a mythical talisman than a geological object — powerful not because it exists, but because it has been believed in for centuries. Despite countless stories and portrayals, there is no scientific evidence supporting the existence of the Nagamani. It is most likely a product of folklore, symbolism, and cultural storytelling — possibly originating from rare stones found in snake carcasses and misidentified as mystical objects.Simpsons prediction of Labubu doll goes viral: Video sparks fear about creepy toy's dark origins","The mythical Nagamani, a glowing gem from cobras' heads, is deeply rooted in South Asian folklore, promising power and protection.

Flynn's return as Obama came on the heels of recent comments the former president made at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser, in which he urged Democratic leadership to “toughen up.” Flynn's Obama echoed that sentiment during Tuesday's “Tonight Show” monologue. “I'm not just talking about Democratic voters. I'm talking about the Democrats in power,” he told Fallon. “Take Chuck Schumer, for example. I mean, just look at him. I've eaten roast beef at Arby's tougher than this guy.” “We expect this guy to be tough?” he asked about the current Senate Minority Leader. “He has a tough time just keeping his damn glasses on his nose.” When he was asked who Democrats should look to in America right now for strong leadership, Flynn's Obama offered, “You gotta go with the popular vote.

What do you think he can bench? 100, 200 ounces?” Flynn's Obama joked about Sanders. “I'll bet he still exercises with that old-timey machine that vibrates your body with a belt.” “What about the younger rising Democrats like Gavin Newsom?” Fallon later inquired, to which Flynn's Obama responded, “Oh, Gavin Newsom, come on. Really? You think that's tough? A guy who looks like he placed fourth in a Pat Riley look-alike contest?” As for Biden, Fallon asked whether or not Flynn's Obama thought his fellow former president was tough enough to combat Trump. “Come on now.

Coyote,” the “Tonight Show” veteran joked. “At this point, the man is 90% dust.”","“The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon” called in former president Barack Obama (Dion Flynn) Tuesday night to give some advice to House and Senate Democrats in their fight against the Trump Administration. Flynn's return as Obama came on the heels of recent comments the former president made at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser, in which he urged Democratic leadership to “toughen up.” Flynn's Obama echoed that sentiment during Tuesday's “Tonight Show” monologue. “I'm not just talking about Democratic voters. I'm talking about the Democrats in power,” he told Fallon. “Take Chuck Schumer, for example. I mean, just look at him. I've eaten roast beef at Arby's tougher than this guy.” “We expect this guy to be tough?” he asked about the current Senate Minority Leader. “He has a tough time just keeping his damn glasses on his nose.” When he was asked who Democrats should look to in America right now for strong leadership, Flynn's Obama offered, “You gotta go with the popular vote.

n3gpdmg,"  I'm even more embarrassed to say that I don't only know what you are talking about, but I was also recently forced to jump on the labubu train thanks to my daughter. As someone else pointed out, any retail shop you buy from (other than PopMart) is going to be selling them at some premium you shouldn't want to pay. Assuming they are even real, as there is apparently an entire market of fake (Lafufus) out there. With that said, we had recent success buying both from Amazon and the PopMart app during the nightly drops. The app is horrible and beyond buggy, but we managed to score 3 that way, 2 earlier this week and 1 last night. It takes a lot of patience and dealing with the errors, and there is a good chance your account will get locked out for doing what you are supposed to do (constantly refreshing, tapping, etc.). Amazon is a bit more complicated because of the bots. I've seen the single and full packs drop every day for the past few days, but they sell out almost instantly. Within seconds of one dropping, I saw Amazon report that there were ""over 30k in people's carts"". It's f'n insane. The trick I found on Amazon is to use a regular browser on a computer, NOT the app. Wait and find a drop of what you want, add it to your cart, attempt to check out, and almost certainly get the error page about them being out of stock. On this page, there is a Continue button, but DON'T click that. Instead, click the text link that says something about the address (I forget the exact verbiage) which will just attempt to re-add it to your cart. You can also hit the refresh button on that browser tab. Odds are you won't get anything that round, but don't give up. Just keep reloading, over and over and over again. You will be one step closer to the finish line on the next drop, which can happen anytime later. Usually ~30 minutes but it can vary. Eventually, it should add to your cart, allow you to proceed to the next step, and checkout. You will still only have seconds to complete that last step, but I've had success with that method on a few occasions. Good luck and I'm sorry you are involved in this now as well.","I'm even more embarrassed to say that I don't only know what you are talking about, but I was also recently forced to jump on the labubu train thanks to my daughter.

The Chinese company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers said this week that it expects profit for the first six months of this year to jump by at least 350% compared with the prior-year period, largely because of its smash hit plush toy, the . Pop Mart joins a small list of companies that have tapped into the zeitgeist, drawing in millions of buyers who, for one reason or another, simply must get their hands on a toy or gadget of the moment. But what makes the Labubu a must-have, or any toy for that matter, is a decades-old question that toy makers have yet to figure out. Here's a look at some of the most popular toys over the years. Cabbage Patch Kids Cabbage Patch Kids began as chubby-faced dolls with yarn hair that came with adoption papers. During the 1980s the dolls were so popular that parents waited in long lines at stores trying to get a hold of them. More than 90 million Cabbage Patch Kids were sold worldwide during their heyday. Cabbage Patch Kids, which were created by Xavier Roberts and initially sold by Coleco, were relaunched in 2004, looking to take part in the successful return of other popular 1980s toys including Strawberry Shortcake, Care Bears and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. A Cabbage Patch Kid museum named BabyLand General Hospital still exists in Cleveland, Georgia. The dolls entered the in 2023. Beanie Baby captivated consumers in the mid-1990s. The cuddly $5 toys were under-stuffed for maximum hug-ability, stamped with cute names on their Ty Inc. tags, and given limited edition runs. Many people collected, traded and sold the toys with the hopes that their value would just keep going up at the dawn of the e-commerce age. It made some people money, and the founder, , a billionaire in three years. In 2014 Warner learned that he would not go to prison for hiding at least $25 million from U.S. tax authorities and instead received two years' probation. Warner, one of the highest profile figures snared in a federal investigation of Americans using Swiss bank accounts to avoid U.S. taxes, had pleaded guilty to a single count of tax evasion. Tamagotchi Looking for a pet without the real-life responsibilities? Well then the Tamagotchi electronic pet from Bandai was for you. Consumers were hooked on the egg-shaped plastic toy that first launched in Japan in 1996 and became a craze worldwide in the late 1990s and 2000s. Users were tasked with taking care of their virtual pet by pressing buttons that simulate feeding, disciplining and playing with the critter on screen. If a Tamagotchi is neglected, it dies. In 2013 was reborn as a mobile app, duplicating the experience of the plastic handheld toy. The toy was inducted into the in May. Fidget Spinner — the 3-inch twirling gadgets that took over classrooms and cubicles — were all the rage in 2017. The toy was considered somewhat of an outlier at the time, given that it wasn't made by a major company, timed for the holiday season, or promoted in TV commercials. Fidget spinners were more easily found at gas stations or 7-Eleven than at big toy chains. Fidget spinners had been around for years, mostly used by kids with autism or attention disorders to help them concentrate, but they became more popular after being featured on social media. While hot toys are often made by one company, fidget spinners were made by numerous manufacturers, mostly in China. The toys were marketed as a concentration aid but became so popular among children that many schools started banning them, saying that they were a distraction. Labubu The , by artist and illustrator Kasing Lung, first appeared as monsters with pointed ears and pointy teeth in three picture books inspired by Nordic mythology in 2015. In 2019 Lung struck a deal with Pop Mart, a company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers, to sell Labubu figurines. But it wasn't until Pop Mart started selling Labubu plush toys on key rings in 2023 that the toothy monsters suddenly seemed to be everywhere, including in the hands of Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and NBA star Dillon Brooks. K-pop singer Lisa of Blackpink began posting images of hers for her more than 100 million followers on Instagram and on TikTok, where Labubu pandemonium has broken out. Labubu has been a bonanza for Pop Mart. Its revenue more than doubled in 2024 to 13.04 billion yuan ($1.81 billion), thanks in part to its elvish monster.

mov_ED9764115317A0246EB6F9C452963749,"  Pop Mart has struck it rich. The Chinese company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers said this week that it expects profit for the first six months of this year to jump by at least 350% compared with the prior-year period, largely because of its smash hit plush toy, the Labubu. Pop Mart joins a small list of companies that have tapped into the zeitgeist, drawing in millions of buyers who, for one reason or another, simply must get their hands on a toy or gadget of the moment. But what makes the Labubu a must-have, or any toy for that matter, is a decades-old question that toy makers have yet to figure out. Here's a look at some of the most popular toys over the years. Cabbage Patch Kids Cabbage Patch Kids began as chubby-faced dolls with yarn hair that came with adoption papers. During the 1980s the dolls were so popular that parents waited in long lines at stores trying to get a hold of them. More than 90 million Cabbage Patch Kids were sold worldwide during their heyday. Cabbage Patch Kids, which were created by Xavier Roberts and initially sold by Coleco, were relaunched in 2004, looking to take part in the successful return of other popular 1980s toys including Strawberry Shortcake, Care Bears and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. A Cabbage Patch Kid museum named BabyLand General Hospital still exists in Cleveland, Georgia. The dolls entered the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2023. Beanie Baby Beanie Babies captivated consumers in the mid-1990s. The cuddly $5 toys were under-stuffed for maximum hug-ability, stamped with cute names on their Ty Inc. tags, and given limited edition runs. Many people collected, traded and sold the toys with the hopes that their value would just keep going up at the dawn of the e-commerce age. It made some people money, and the founder, Ty Warner, a billionaire in three years. In 2014 Warner learned that he would not go to prison for hiding at least $25 million from U.S. tax authorities and instead received two years' probation. Warner, one of the highest profile figures snared in a federal investigation of Americans using Swiss bank accounts to avoid U.S. taxes, had pleaded guilty to a single count of tax evasion. Tamagotchi Looking for a pet without the real-life responsibilities? Well then the Tamagotchi electronic pet from Bandai was for you. Consumers were hooked on the egg-shaped plastic toy that first launched in Japan in 1996 and became a craze worldwide in the late 1990s and 2000s. Users were tasked with taking care of their virtual pet by pressing buttons that simulate feeding, disciplining and playing with the critter on screen. If a Tamagotchi is neglected, it dies. In 2013 Tamagotchi was reborn as a mobile app, duplicating the experience of the plastic handheld toy. The toy was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in May. Fidget Spinner Fidget spinners — the 3-inch twirling gadgets that took over classrooms and cubicles — were all the rage in 2017. The toy was considered somewhat of an outlier at the time, given that it wasn't made by a major company, timed for the holiday season, or promoted in TV commercials. Fidget spinners were more easily found at gas stations or 7-Eleven than at big toy chains. Fidget spinners had been around for years, mostly used by kids with autism or attention disorders to help them concentrate, but they became more popular after being featured on social media. While hot toys are often made by one company, fidget spinners were made by numerous manufacturers, mostly in China. The toys were marketed as a concentration aid but became so popular among children that many schools started banning them, saying that they were a distraction. Labubu The Labubu, by artist and illustrator Kasing Lung, first appeared as monsters with pointed ears and pointy teeth in three picture books inspired by Nordic mythology in 2015. In 2019 Lung struck a deal with Pop Mart, a company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers, to sell Labubu figurines. But it wasn't until Pop Mart started selling Labubu plush toys on key rings in 2023 that the toothy monsters suddenly seemed to be everywhere, including in the hands of Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and NBA star Dillon Brooks.

mov_3101FE20C72BAA99DBD90BA9DDA88DB8,"  Many people in this world are failing to live the life of their dreams. But Klay Thompson isn't one of them. Four NBA championships, his #1 jersey retired at WSU, experiencing the pain of an ACL injury, and comebacks after comebacks after comebacks. Now, that's the basketball star for you. Outside the court, the Captain's dating life is nothing short of a rollercoaster ride. His latest sweetheart? Megan Thee Stallion. Cue the confetti cannons and Twitter takes, because July just got hotter than Houston asphalt at noon. After weeks of winks, whispers, and wild speculation, Megan Thee Stallion and Klay Thompson officially dropped the mic on all rumors. On July 12, Megan posted a scroll-stopping Insta dump. Among sun-drenched shots, two pics featured the duo holding hands like high school sweethearts with VIP access to courtside drama and Hottie pride. By July 14, TMZ caught them exiting NYC's Carbone, hand in hand and camera-aware, like a scene straight out of a blockbuster rom-com. And just to keep the timeline buzzing, Megan lit up TikTok with a video of her sitting cozy on her mystery man's lap while unboxing a Labubu doll, gifted by the new MVP in her life. While heartbroken admirers sulk in silence, most fans are celebrating, boldly claiming that Klay Thompson just entered the Hall of Fame of dating wins. Meanwhile, Nick Angstadt and Isaac Harris pointed out something interesting in the latest edition of the Locked On Mavericks podcast. Here's the thing: What if this duo becomes the NBA version of Travis-Taylor? Nick mentioned that his friend, Brittany Cohen, tweeted: “Oh my God, is this going to be the Mavs version of Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift?” Meanwhile, how did the Dallas Mavericks expert react? “I was like, “That would be amazing.” Yeah. Give me Megan Thee Stallion at a bunch of Mavs games. Just the camera pans to her all the time, and she's just cheering on Klay Thompson. That'd be fun,” Angstadt said. Besides, Isaac Harris wished Klay Thompson's late dog, Rocco, were alive to see his 'dad' hold hands with Megan. But Nick continued, “That would be fun. The last time we had a real celebrity friend was J. Cole and Desmond Jr., right? Oh my gosh, yes. Had that in a while. There have been a couple that showed up here and there, but J. Cole was at a couple of games.” September 2023 rewrote the love playbook with a touchdown and a standing ovation. Taylor Swift turned Arrowhead Stadium into the world's most-watched date spot when she pulled up to cheer for Travis Kelce, Kansas City Chiefs' tight end and smooth operator. Months earlier, Kelce shot his shot after attending her concert, and somehow, the universe responded with glitter, gridiron sparks, and the ultimate crossover episode. Well, neither this is September, nor are Klay and Megan, Travis and Taylor. However, the spotlights could point towards the possibility of the latest lovebirds becoming the NBA's version of the NFL's favorite couple. One more interesting turn of events here is that the Los Angeles Lakers might have just lost one of their fans to the Dallas Mavericks. You know what this means? Klay Thompson brought with him a new fan for the franchise. Klay Thompson's girlfriend might not be a Lakers fan anymore On April 7, 2024, Megan Thee Stallion turned the Lakers versus Timberwolves showdown into a front-row fashion frenzy. The then-29-year-old arrived in a daring black top and cargo pants, but the real mic drop was her lime green Hermès Birkin bag, clocking in at $16,500. She added pointed black heels, oversized hoops, dramatic lashes, and a deep side part. Megan owned that arena like it was Grammy night. The Lakers just took an unexpected L, and it had nothing to do with the scoreboard. Megan Thee Stallion, who turned heads courtside at a Los Angeles Lakers game, has switched jerseys in spirit. Now dating 35-year-old Dallas Mavericks guard Klay Thompson, she's got fans convinced she's traded purple and gold for Maverick blue. And honestly, love might be the boldest free agency move yet. Love crossed half-court and nailed a buzzer-beater. From courtside couture to cuddly TikToks and rom-com exits, Megan and Klay are giving the NBA its own celebrity saga. The Lakers may have lost a fan, but the Mavericks just gained a queen. So buckle up, because this love story might just shake the league harder than a trade deadline surprise.","Many people in this world are failing to live the life of their dreams.

I gravitated towards a favorite who reminded me of cotton candy. The magenta/blue furred monster: Luck. Certain I wouldn't get one off the Pop Mart site on launch day, I found a reseller in Indonesia (Hold by Hand) and pre-ordered Luck on April 15th, 2025. After hearing about the abundance of fakes and quality issues in this series, I also bought a whole set from StockX on April 24th, hoping to bag at least one authentic Luck of acceptable quality. The rest, I'd give to friends and family, e.g. the Loyalty for my sister. Part of me hoped to score the Secret Id, which my sister wanted (The psycho that I am, I just wanted the thrill of finding it). The Secret would prove elusive in this set, driving me to certain madness. But that's a story for another time. Somehow, the Hold by Hand Luck ended up being of better quality despite shipping to my house in a crumpled box (Thanks, Fedex). The fur was fuller, and the face looked friendlier for some reason (see first photo). I liked it enough to replace the Toffee Exciting Macaron dangling from my daily purse.

I gravitated towards a favorite who reminded me of cotton candy. The magenta/blue furred monster: Luck. Certain I wouldn't get one off the Pop Mart site on launch day, I found a reseller in Indonesia (Hold by Hand) and pre-ordered Luck on April 15th, 2025. After hearing about the abundance of fakes and quality issues in this series, I also bought a whole set from StockX on April 24th, hoping to bag at least one authentic Luck of acceptable quality. The rest, I'd give to friends and family, e.g. the Loyalty for my sister. Part of me hoped to score the Secret Id, which my sister wanted (The psycho that I am, I just wanted the thrill of finding it). The Secret would prove elusive in this set, driving me to certain madness. But that's a story for another time. Somehow, the Hold by Hand Luck ended up being of better quality despite shipping to my house in a crumpled box (Thanks, Fedex). The fur was fuller, and the face looked friendlier for some reason (see first photo). I liked it enough to replace the Toffee Exciting Macaron dangling from my daily purse.

但是，基本面依舊完好，恒指來到再次挑戰3月高位的水平，所有的阻力都只是短暫的，再耐心等等，恒指有條件再創新高。 中央工作會議一個接一個的開，不斷的推出振興經濟的新措施。 在貿易戰中，近日中國對外貿易的數據依然理想，依然出超。 美准售芯片予中國 科技股受惠

SOURCE: TECH IN ASIA RESEARCH Yet Chinese brands have only started expanding aggressively across the region in the past three years. By the end of 2024, more than 60 Chinese F&B brands were operating over 6,100 outlets in South-east Asia. That's triple the 2022 figure of less than 2,000, according to research firm Momentum Works. With China's consumer market still flat post-pandemic, South-east Asia, with a population of 700 million people, 30 per cent of whom are aged 15 to 34, has become a good target for brands, said Lina Yan, consumer analyst at HSBC Global Investment Research.

Four of South-east Asia's six biggest countries have the world's highest ethnic Chinese population shares. “Southeast Asian markets are definitely more China-friendly than the US and Western countries,” Jason Yu, managing director at Beijing-based CTR Research, told Tech in Asia. Among Chinese brands, Mixue stands out in scale, with 4,700 outlets across South-east Asia as at September 2024, according to its prospectus. Over 84 per cent of them are in Indonesia and Vietnam. Mixue sells ice cream and cold drinks for under US$1, with all its stores in the region run by franchisees. Most of its revenue comes from selling supplies to them. The company's scale of 40,000 outlets in China gave it a foundation of a low-cost, reliable supply chain that no competitor can match. Its optimisation level is simply in a league of its own. That operational edge lets it keep franchise fees low to scale fast and earn from ingredient sales, according to Jason Ong, master transformation strategist at Axxelerated Transformation, a Singapore-based consulting firm specialising in retail innovation. “It's intensely competitive in China,” he said. “Anyone who survives there and expands abroad must already have a strong playbook.” Other Chinese beverage chains such as Luckin and Cotti also ran tens of thousands of stores in China before entering South-east Asia. In contrast, the region's biggest homegrown coffee brands – Thailand's Cafe Amazon and Indonesia's Point Coffee – have around 4,400 and 1,200 outlets, respectively. Beyond sheer numbers, some Chinese brands are making South-east Asia the centrepiece of their global push. For example, Miniso's largest store in the world is not in China but in Indonesia. Opened in August 2024, the flagship spans 3,000 square metres. New approach Miniso began by positioning itself as Japanese-influenced. However, it later ditched Japanese elements in its styling after a backlash in China driven by consumer nationalism. Now it touts itself as a global lifestyle brand. Its makeover has signalled a bigger shift. Chinese consumer brands, long deemed budget copycats of Western or Japanese labels, are winning on their own paths. Leading Chinese brands are reshaping their image by investing heavily in design, R&D, and customer experience, said Mark Greeven, professor of innovation and strategy and dean of Asia at the International Institute for Management Development. While Miniso partners with well-known global intellectual properties such as Disney, Harry Potter, and Sanrio, Pop Mart has sparked a global craze among young consumers with Labubu figures from its exclusive IP.

丧尸病毒的传播速度极快，医院顿时陷入一片混乱，张牙舞爪的丧尸与惊慌失措的民众交织在一起。 而辛格的妻子「凛」则恰好在医院里担任医生，此时她正在楼上与院长商谈用鱼肝来治疗老板娘的事宜。 就在辛格还未弄清事态的严重性时，医院的组织已宣布全面封锁，决意将所有人进行清除以避免病毒的扩散。 得知消息的辛格，毫不犹豫地冲进医院，誓言要救出妻子，他一路拳打丧尸，腿踢怪物，活脱脱像在演绎一场无双战斗。 乍一看，这个情节确实有些离谱，但这正是本片的“故事主线”。 全片的剧情并不复杂，观众主要是看男主如何一番猛烈出击，直面丧尸。 更离奇与搞笑的是，这些丧尸还有二次进化的情节，明明上一秒已经死去，下一秒却又站起来，甚至还变成了“Labubu造型”...

mov_A1431F6E06EC47074B6789E52958B51C,"  BEIJING, July 17, 2025 /PRNewswire/   ""I remember we were in a village in China for dinner recently. At the restaurant, the waiter could not speak English but we immediately found a young Chinese lady who helped us. And we ended up eating together, Chinese people, an Egyptian, my colleague from Switzerland, and people from other countries. How beautiful is this,"" Maged Refaat Aboulmagd, an ambassadorial member of the Egyptian Council for Foreign Affairs, told the Global Times. ""We took a photo and started laughing, then she chose food for us. It was pleasant, simple, and dignified,"" said Refaat. ""She is like most Chinese people we've met in China… always smiling and willing to communicate. There is absolutely no barrier."" Refaat was one of the guests invited to China to the Global Civilizations Dialogue Ministerial Meeting. Themed ""Safeguarding Diversity of Human Civilizations for World Peace and Development,"" the two-day event, which kicked off on Thursday, attracted over 600 attendees from 140 countries and regions. Before Thursday's meeting, international guests toured cities such as Shanghai, Hangzhou, Qufu, and Dunhuang to gain firsthand insight into the Chinese society. When he was visiting Shanghai, Gabriel Fischer, European Affairs Advisor to the Chairman of Voice-Social Democracy of Slovak and representative of the Slovak National Council to the European Union, said he not only visited the historical heritage parts of the city, but also the futuristic parts in the city's business center complete with skyscrapers. Taking his trip to China as an example, Fischer recalled some biased reports on China by European media outlets. ""It is absolutely crucial to see it with your own eyes, by coming into the country, experiencing the culture, and meeting with the people… We cannot influence the media's representation of other countries, but we can enrich our experiences further by traveling and seeing other cultures. That's why I would recommend visiting China to anyone to gain inspiration and return home more knowledgeable."" A platform for exchange Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Thursday that China is ready to work with other countries in building a global network for dialogue and cooperation among civilizations, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Xi, also general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the statement in a congratulatory letter to the Global Civilizations Dialogue Ministerial Meeting. He pledged that China will work with other countries to champion equality, mutual learning, dialogue and inclusiveness among civilizations, and implement the Global Civilization Initiative (GCI), in a bid to provide fresh impetus for advancing human civilizations and promoting world peace and development. ""The world is, in nature, a place of diverse civilizations,"" Xi said in the letter. ""History has shown us that exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations are essential for civilizations to flourish and human progress to be made."" President Xi put forward the GCI in March 2023, following the Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative. The initiative, as Xi pointed out in his speech, advocates respect for the diversity of civilizations, the common values of humanity, the importance of inheritance and innovation of civilizations, as well as robust international people-to-people exchanges and cooperation. When talking about the significance of this conference to a world that is mired in conflicts, Fischer said, ""I personally think that the reason of conflicts is usually the misunderstanding among civilizations, the misunderstanding of each other's culture, and this meeting can provide us with the opportunity to learn from each other."" Refaat said that a few days ago he took the bullet train to visit a place where science and innovation have been used in farming. He said he saw how the farmers learn to use machinery, automation technologies, and intelligent systems, to improve production efficiency, reduce labor intensity, and significantly enhance agricultural productivity. ""It was truly fascinating!"" Refaat hailed. He said agro-industry is exactly what Egypt needs. At one of the sub-forums of the meeting, China's Olympic champion in swimming, Pan Zhanle, shared a story between him and his strong competitor, Romania's star swimmer David Popovici. He said that Popovici's perseverance and determination have been a constant source of inspiration for him. At parallel sub-forums on Friday, participants actively participated in discussions on the crucial role of inter-civilization exchange and mutual learning in building an inclusive world, and in promoting global development and prosperity, cultural inheritance and innovation. David Ferguson, honorary chief English editor of the Foreign Languages Press, and a participant at the meeting, told the Global Times that the Ministerial Meeting of the Global Civilizations Dialogue reflects a broader strategy aimed at replacing conflict with dialogue, underscoring China's serious commitment to fostering global understanding and cooperation. Raphael Tuju, a former Kenyan Cabinet Secretary, told the Global Times that true civilization rests on ""the ability to share, live together, and respect each other,"" and expressed his hope that China would initiate more soft-power connections, including people-to-people exchanges, education, and cultural programs. Building bridges During the parallel sub-forums on Friday, Liu Jianchao, head of the International Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said that China promotes people-to-people exchanges through the country's commitment to openness and inclusiveness. ""Traveling in China"" and ""Shopping in China"" have become increasingly popular, said Liu, also giving the example of Black Myth: Wukong, Ne Zha, and Labubu, which have gained widespread popularity among young people around the world. ""I'd originally planned to bring some Labubu toys for everyone, but they were completely sold out. If anyone manages to find one, please help me buy one,"" Liu joked. Since the launch of the GCI, China has actively built platforms for international cultural exchange and cooperation, establishing a global network for dialogue among civilizations and effectively promoting mutual understanding and learning among diverse cultures, Zhang Yiwu, a professor of cultural studies at Peking University, told the Global Times. Over the years, China has established a series of multilateral exchange platforms, such as the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations and the Conference on Dialogue Between Chinese and African Civilizations, and held a series of activities, including the China-ASEAN People-to-People Exchange Year and the Liangzhu Forum, building a platform for equal dialogue among different civilizations. Many countries, especially those in the Global South, have responded positively and warmly to China's GCI. This demonstrates that, even as the world stands at a crossroads, the forces that cherish peace and seek mutual learning among civilizations remain the mainstream of the international community, said Zhang. At the ""Story Sharing"" segment of the opening session on Thursday, Kenyan student Jamlick Mwangi Kariuki from the Beijing Jiaotong University shared his story.

mov_F553DDCCB0A34270484487A6B76240F7,"  Chinese toy company Pop Mart is poised for a significant financial uplift, projecting a profit surge of at least 350 per cent for the first half of this year. This impressive forecast is largely attributed to the runaway success of its plush toy, the Labubu. The firm, which caters to a dedicated market of toy connoisseurs and social media influencers, has effectively tapped into the cultural zeitgeist. Its ability to create a 'must-have' item has drawn in millions of buyers eager to acquire the latest sensation. Pop Mart's achievement places it among a select few companies that have mastered the art of captivating consumer desire. However, the fundamental question of what elevates a toy like the Labubu to an indispensable status, or indeed any toy, continues to baffle manufacturers, remaining a decades-old mystery within the industry. Here's a look at some of the most popular toys over the years. Cabbage Patch Kids Cabbage Patch Kids began as chubby-faced dolls with yarn hair that came with adoption papers. During the 1980s the dolls were so popular that parents waited in long lines at stores trying to get a hold of them. More than 90 million Cabbage Patch Kids were sold worldwide during their heyday. Cabbage Patch Kids, which were created by Xavier Roberts and initially sold by Coleco, were relaunched in 2004, looking to take part in the successful return of other popular 1980s toys including Strawberry Shortcake, Care Bears and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. A Cabbage Patch Kid museum named BabyLand General Hospital still exists in Cleveland, Georgia. The dolls entered the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2023. Beanie Baby Beanie Babies captivated consumers in the mid-1990s. The cuddly $5 toys were under-stuffed for maximum hug-ability, stamped with cute names on their Ty Inc. tags, and given limited edition runs. An authentic Beanie Baby is seen on display at eBay's San Jose, Calif. headquarters on Oct. 17, 2007. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, file) (AP2007) Many people collected, traded and sold the toys with the hopes that their value would just keep going up at the dawn of the e-commerce age. It made some people money, and the founder, Ty Warner, a billionaire in three years. In 2014 Warner learned that he would not go to prison for hiding at least $25 million from U.S. tax authorities and instead received two years' probation. Warner, one of the highest profile figures snared in a federal investigation of Americans using Swiss bank accounts to avoid U.S. taxes, had pleaded guilty to a single count of tax evasion. Tamagotchi Looking for a pet without the real-life responsibilities? Well then the Tamagotchi electronic pet from Bandai was for you. Consumers were hooked on the egg-shaped plastic toy that first launched in Japan in 1996 and became a craze worldwide in the late 1990s and 2000s. Aki Maita, Japanese developer of the Tamagotchi digital pet, shows on Monday, December 15, 1997 (AP1997) Users were tasked with taking care of their virtual pet by pressing buttons that simulate feeding, disciplining and playing with the critter on screen. If a Tamagotchi is neglected, it dies. In 2013 Tamagotchi was reborn as a mobile app, duplicating the experience of the plastic handheld toy. The toy was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in May. Fidget Spinner Fidget spinners — the 3-inch twirling gadgets that took over classrooms and cubicles — were all the rage in 2017. The toy was considered somewhat of an outlier at the time, given that it wasn't made by a major company, timed for the holiday season, or promoted in TV commercials. Fidget spinners were more easily found at gas stations or 7-Eleven than at big toy chains. Funky Monkey Toys store owner Tom Jones plays with a fidget spinner in Oxford, Mich, Thursday, May 11, 2017. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File) (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) Fidget spinners had been around for years, mostly used by kids with autism or attention disorders to help them concentrate, but they became more popular after being featured on social media. While hot toys are often made by one company, fidget spinners were made by numerous manufacturers, mostly in China.

Labubu The Labubu, by artist and illustrator Kasing Lung, first appeared as monsters with pointed ears and pointy teeth in three picture books inspired by Nordic mythology in 2015. Labubu-Blockbuster Toys (Pop Mart) In 2019 Lung struck a deal with Pop Mart, a company that caters to toy connoisseurs and influencers, to sell Labubu figurines. But it wasn't until Pop Mart started selling Labubu plush toys on key rings in 2023 that the toothy monsters suddenly seemed to be everywhere, including in the hands of Rihanna, Kim Kardashian and NBA star Dillon Brooks. K-pop singer Lisa of Blackpink began posting images of hers for her more than 100 million followers on Instagram and on TikTok, where Labubu pandemonium has broken out. Labubu has been a bonanza for Pop Mart. Its revenue more than doubled in 2024 to 13.04 billion yuan ($1.81 billion), thanks in part to its elvish monster....","Chinese toy company Pop Mart is poised for a significant financial uplift, projecting a profit surge of at least 350 per cent for the first half of this year. This impressive forecast is largely attributed to the runaway success of its plush toy, the Labubu. The firm, which caters to a dedicated market of toy connoisseurs and social media influencers, has effectively tapped into the cultural zeitgeist. Its ability to create a 'must-have' item has drawn in millions of buyers eager to acquire the latest sensation. Pop Mart's achievement places it among a select few companies that have mastered the art of captivating consumer desire. However, the fundamental question of what elevates a toy like the Labubu to an indispensable status, or indeed any toy, continues to baffle manufacturers, remaining a decades-old mystery within the industry. Here's a look at some of the most popular toys over the years. Cabbage Patch Kids Cabbage Patch Kids began as chubby-faced dolls with yarn hair that came with adoption papers. During the 1980s the dolls were so popular that parents waited in long lines at stores trying to get a hold of them. More than 90 million Cabbage Patch Kids were sold worldwide during their heyday. Cabbage Patch Kids, which were created by Xavier Roberts and initially sold by Coleco, were relaunched in 2004, looking to take part in the successful return of other popular 1980s toys including Strawberry Shortcake, Care Bears and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. A Cabbage Patch Kid museum named BabyLand General Hospital still exists in Cleveland, Georgia. The dolls entered the National Toy Hall of Fame in 2023. Beanie Baby Beanie Babies captivated consumers in the mid-1990s. The cuddly $5 toys were under-stuffed for maximum hug-ability, stamped with cute names on their Ty Inc. tags, and given limited edition runs. An authentic Beanie Baby is seen on display at eBay's San Jose, Calif. headquarters on Oct. 17, 2007. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, file) (AP2007) Many people collected, traded and sold the toys with the hopes that their value would just keep going up at the dawn of the e-commerce age. It made some people money, and the founder, Ty Warner, a billionaire in three years. In 2014 Warner learned that he would not go to prison for hiding at least $25 million from U.S. tax authorities and instead received two years' probation. Warner, one of the highest profile figures snared in a federal investigation of Americans using Swiss bank accounts to avoid U.S. taxes, had pleaded guilty to a single count of tax evasion. Tamagotchi Looking for a pet without the real-life responsibilities? Well then the Tamagotchi electronic pet from Bandai was for you. Consumers were hooked on the egg-shaped plastic toy that first launched in Japan in 1996 and became a craze worldwide in the late 1990s and 2000s. Aki Maita, Japanese developer of the Tamagotchi digital pet, shows on Monday, December 15, 1997 (AP1997) Users were tasked with taking care of their virtual pet by pressing buttons that simulate feeding, disciplining and playing with the critter on screen. If a Tamagotchi is neglected, it dies. In 2013 Tamagotchi was reborn as a mobile app, duplicating the experience of the plastic handheld toy. The toy was inducted into the World Video Game Hall of Fame in May. Fidget Spinner Fidget spinners — the 3-inch twirling gadgets that took over classrooms and cubicles — were all the rage in 2017. The toy was considered somewhat of an outlier at the time, given that it wasn't made by a major company, timed for the holiday season, or promoted in TV commercials. Fidget spinners were more easily found at gas stations or 7-Eleven than at big toy chains. Funky Monkey Toys store owner Tom Jones plays with a fidget spinner in Oxford, Mich, Thursday, May 11, 2017. (AP Photo/Carlos Osorio, File) (Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) Fidget spinners had been around for years, mostly used by kids with autism or attention disorders to help them concentrate, but they became more popular after being featured on social media. While hot toys are often made by one company, fidget spinners were made by numerous manufacturers, mostly in China. The toys were marketed as a concentration aid but became so popular among children that many schools started banning them, saying that they were a distraction. Labubu The Labubu, by artist and illustrator Kasing Lung, first appeared as monsters with pointed ears and pointy teeth in three picture books inspired by Nordic mythology in 2015.

These objects, which range from the infamous Annabelle Doll to the terrifying Dybbuk Box, are supposedly cursed or possessed by malevolent spirits. After coming into contact with these items, numerous paranormal investigators, collectors, and even ordinary individuals have reported having horrific experiences such as ghost sightings, poor luck or mysterious noises. Recently, a tragic incident shocked the paranormal community when paranormal investigator Dan Rivera reportedly died under mysterious circumstances while travelling with the haunted Annabelle doll. This incident brought global attention back to these cursed items, reminding people of the dark stories connected to them. 10 Most Haunted Objects In The World Whether it's a doll that moves on its own, a chair that brings death to anyone who sits in it, or a painting that causes fear and sickness, these objects are more than just legends. Many are kept locked away in museums or vaults to avoid further harm. In this article, we explore the 10 most famous paranormal objects in the world and the chilling stories behind them. 1. Annabelle Doll It is believed that Annabelle, a creepy doll with an unsettling appearance, is haunted by a malevolent soul. In the 1970s, two roommates reportedly observed the doll moving by itself and leaving ominous notes. Ed and Lorraine Warren, paranormal investigators, said it was haunted and, for safety, kept it in a glass case in their occult museum. Annabelle, a horror film, was inspired by the doll. 2. The Dybbuk Box A wine cabinet known as the Dybbuk Box has been said to be haunted by a wicked spirit from Jewish legend known as the Dybbuk. Its new owner had terrible luck, weird smells, and nightmares after purchasing it at an estate auction. Similar horrifying incidents were thereafter recounted by other people who possessed or handled the box. Because of its shady history, it is currently locked up and serves as the inspiration for the film The Possession. 3. The Anguished Man Painting The anguished man painting (Image: Fine Art America) This painting is believed to evoke terror and paranormal activity since it depicts a dark person with a screaming face. It is said that the artist poured his own blood into the paint and committed suicide soon after. According to the present owner, anytime the picture is out, he sees shadows, hears sobbing, and has weird experiences. ALSO READ: Haunted Annabelle Doll Makes Eerie Appearance At Gettysberg Orphanage During 'Devils On The Run' Tour 4. The Bell Witch Haunting In the early 1800s, a family in Tennessee reported that a ghostly spirit had been haunting them for years. Known as the Bell Witch, the ghost tore hair, scarred walls and even killed John Bell, the family's father. President Andrew Jackson is said to have visited the location because the story became so well-known. 5. The Crying Boy Painting The crying Boy, Robert The doll (Image: Etsy and Atlas Obscura) In the UK, this mass-produced artwork of a weeping kid gained notoriety after it was set on fire in multiple homes. Strangely, the painting would not be harmed by the fire. People began to think it was cursed or brought bad luck. To prevent damage, many eventually destroyed or disposed of the painting. 6. Robert the Doll In Key West, Florida, a youngster named Robert Eugene Otto received a vintage doll called Robert. Locals thought the doll had a life of its own, and the boy blamed it for mischievous actions. The doll is said to move, chuckle, and bring misfortune to people who mistreat it. It is now housed in a museum, and guests are urged to obtain permission before snapping a picture of it. 7.

mov_1342F52B6B4358BCC847DF255466AAE6,"  July 17, 2024 – Archyworldys BEIJING – Toy manufacturer Pop Mart International Group is experiencing a remarkable surge in profitability, anticipating a minimum 350% increase in first-half profits compared to the previous year. The phenomenal success of its Labubu plush toy is the primary driver behind this financial windfall, captivating collectors and social media enthusiasts alike. The Rise of Collectible Toys and 'Blind Box' Culture Pop Mart's success isn't simply about a popular plush toy; it's a testament to the growing global phenomenon of collectible toys, particularly those utilizing the “blind box” model. This approach, where consumers purchase sealed boxes containing a randomly selected figure, taps into psychological principles of surprise and the thrill of the chase. The limited availability and varying rarity of figures within a series create a secondary market, further fueling demand and driving up prices. Labubu, with its distinctive macaron-like face and expressive eyes, has become a cultural icon, particularly within Chinese youth culture and increasingly, internationally. The toy's appeal extends beyond traditional toy collectors, attracting fashion-conscious consumers and influencers who view Labubu as a status symbol and a form of self-expression. This has been amplified by strategic collaborations with artists and brands, creating limited-edition releases that command premium prices. The company has skillfully leveraged social media platforms like Xiaohongshu (Little Red Book) and Douyin (TikTok) to build a strong online community and generate buzz around its products. Influencer marketing plays a crucial role, with unboxing videos and product showcases reaching millions of potential customers. Pop Mart's ability to cultivate this digital ecosystem has been instrumental in its rapid growth. But what does this mean for the broader toy industry? The success of Pop Mart demonstrates a shift in consumer preferences, with a growing demand for unique, collectible items that offer both aesthetic appeal and a sense of community. Traditional toy manufacturers are taking note, exploring similar strategies to engage with a new generation of collectors. Do you think the blind box model is a sustainable trend, or will consumer interest eventually wane? Pop Mart's business model also benefits from a strong focus on intellectual property (IP) development. The company doesn't just manufacture toys; it creates characters and narratives that resonate with its target audience. This allows them to build brand loyalty and expand into other product categories, such as apparel and accessories. The company's expansion plans include further international growth, with a focus on markets in North America and Europe. How will Pop Mart navigate the challenges of entering new, competitive markets? Pro Tip: When considering collectible investments, research the artist, the brand, and the potential for future releases. Limited editions and collaborations often hold the most value. Further information on Pop Mart can be found on their official website. For a deeper understanding of the collectible toy market, explore resources from Toy World Magazine. Frequently Asked Questions About Pop Mart and Labubu What is driving the popularity of Pop Mart's Labubu toy? The Labubu toy's popularity is driven by its unique design, limited availability, strong social media presence, and appeal to collectors and influencers. How does the 'blind box' model contribute to Pop Mart's success? The blind box model creates a sense of excitement and encourages repeat purchases, as consumers attempt to collect complete sets of figures. Is Pop Mart only popular in China? While initially gaining traction in China, Pop Mart is experiencing growing international demand, particularly in North America and Europe. What is Pop Mart doing to expand its brand beyond toys? Pop Mart is expanding into other product categories, such as apparel and accessories, and focusing on intellectual property development to build brand loyalty.

The Call Me Bae star recently went viral after revealing that her popular Labubu dolls are actually fake. In a light-hearted moment caught on camera, Ananya admitted that she ended up with knock-off Labubu toys, known as Lafufus and fans can't stop talking about it. The clip was shared by Ananya's close friend and social media personality Orry (Orhan Awatramani). In the video, Orry is seen pointing to a Labubu doll hanging from Ananya's designer Chanel bag and asking if it's real. Ananya replied honestly, “It is! But it's on a Chanel bag, so no one will ever know.” The 26-year-old then explained how she got the fake toys. “My friend Ridhima was trying to start a Labubu business and she ordered 100 of them, but ended up with Lafufus instead,” Ananya said with a laugh. Her candid reaction has been praised by fans, many of whom appreciated her honesty and sense of humour. Labubu Doll Trend In Celebrities Meanwhile, Labubu dolls have recently become a major trend, especially among young people and celebrities. These tiny, designer plush toys can be seen hanging off bags, backpacks, and even making appearances at global events. Khushi Kapoor was spotted showing her Labubu to her dad, filmmaker Boney Kapoor. In a funny twist, Boney introduced his own “life-sized Labubu” referring to Orry. Also actress Urvashi Rautela took her Labubu dolls all the way to Wimbledon. On the other hand, she was last seen in Kesari Chapter 2, a historical courtroom drama. The movie also featured Akshay Kumar and R Madhavan. The movie did significantly weel at the box office. Up next, she will be seen in Chaand Mera Dil, a romantic comedy opposite Kill actor Lakshya. She is also set to begin filming for Season 2 of her Amazon Prime Video series Call Me Bae.","Actress Ananya Panday is once again grabbing attention, but this time it's not for a movie role or a red carpet appearance.

Her candid reaction has been praised by fans, many of whom appreciated her honesty and sense of humour. Labubu Doll Trend In Celebrities Meanwhile, Labubu dolls have recently become a major trend, especially among young people and celebrities. These tiny, designer plush toys can be seen hanging off bags, backpacks, and even making appearances at global events. Khushi Kapoor was spotted showing her Labubu to her dad, filmmaker Boney Kapoor. In a funny twist, Boney introduced his own “life-sized Labubu” referring to Orry. Also actress Urvashi Rautela took her Labubu dolls all the way to Wimbledon. On the other hand, she was last seen in Kesari Chapter 2, a historical courtroom drama. The movie also featured Akshay Kumar and R Madhavan. The movie did significantly weel at the box office. Up next, she will be seen in Chaand Mera Dil, a romantic comedy opposite Kill actor Lakshya.

这些套路都快被用得没新意了。 没想到，这回轮到泰国发力，打造出一部堪称「奇葩界顶流」的丧尸题材新片——《尸杀泰拳》。 由Netflix打造，这部影片名副其实，是一部将泰拳与丧尸元素相融合的作品。 然而拍摄得相当重口味呢。 不喜小清新风格者，请勿涉足。 男主角辛格，往昔乃泰拳拳手，如今却沦为送货司机。 不过，这份快递可不普通。 他肩负着护送食物的重任，要确保粮食不被暴民劫掠。 在设定之中，人类的种种不当行径已将地球折腾至极限边缘。 环境污染积重难返，气候系统彻底失控，粮食短缺问题愈发严峻。 在泰国，人们甚至只能依靠昆虫蛋白来勉强维持生计…… 
这一回，辛格负责护送的是鱼。 此鱼乃大佬瓦苏预备给生命垂危的妻子享用的顶级食材。 然而，没等吃几口，富人圈子里陡然有人浑身抽搐，口吐黑血，转瞬之间化作丧尸，旋即陷入疯狂，扑向他人撕咬起来…… 
丧尸病毒如燎原之火般迅猛蔓延，转瞬间，整座医院沦为恐怖的炼狱。 面目狰狞、张牙舞爪的丧尸横行其中，而惊慌失措的民众则在狭窄的过道与房间里仓皇奔逃，绝望的呼喊和凌乱的脚步声交织成一曲末日悲歌。 然而不巧的是，辛格的妻子“凛”身为医院的医生，此刻正在楼上与院长商讨着如何利用鱼肝为老板娘医治病症…… 
众人尚在一头雾水、没弄清楚状况之时，组织便迅速下达指令，宣布对医院实施封锁，决意将院内所有人一并控制，以杜绝病毒扩散的风险。 辛格听闻消息后，心急如焚，瞬间暴起，如同一道黑色的闪电般疾冲向医院，只为营救妻子。 一路上，丧尸、怪物不断涌现，他却毫无惧色，铁拳挥舞间，丧尸纷纷倒地；飞腿扫过处，怪物连连哀嚎，恰似战神现世，一路无双。 先别感到荒诞，这恰恰就是本片的故事脉络。 影片没啥跌宕起伏的剧情，全程主要就是看男主如何暴揍丧尸。 更荒诞且诙谐的是，这些丧尸竟还能进行二次进化。 刚刚前一刻分明已经没了气息，可转瞬之间却又霍然站起，还化作了Labubu的模样。 简而言之，《尸杀泰拳》不过是一部裹着丧尸元素外衣的动作爽片罢了。 其剧情匮乏，深度更是无从谈起。 闲来无事的剧迷倒不妨下载来瞧瞧...",SPR_COMBO[zh] 说到“丧尸片”，想必大家或多或少都看过一两部。 经典之作不胜枚举，有热播长达11年的《行尸走肉》系列；有虐心催泪、令人动容的《釜山行》；还有巧妙融合宫斗元素的《王国》…… 这些套路都快被用得没新意了。 没想到，这回轮到泰国发力，打造出一部堪称「奇葩界顶流」的丧尸题材新片——《尸杀泰拳》。 由Netflix打造，这部影片名副其实，是一部将泰拳与丧尸元素相融合的作品。 然而拍摄得相当重口味呢。 不喜小清新风格者，请勿涉足。 男主角辛格，往昔乃泰拳拳手，如今却沦为送货司机。 不过，这份快递可不普通。 他肩负着护送食物的重任，要确保粮食不被暴民劫掠。 在设定之中，人类的种种不当行径已将地球折腾至极限边缘。 环境污染积重难返，气候系统彻底失控，粮食短缺问题愈发严峻。 在泰国，人们甚至只能依靠昆虫蛋白来勉强维持生计…… 这一回，辛格负责护送的是鱼。 此鱼乃大佬瓦苏预备给生命垂危的妻子享用的顶级食材。 然而，没等吃几口，富人圈子里陡然有人浑身抽搐，口吐黑血，转瞬之间化作丧尸，旋即陷入疯狂，扑向他人撕咬起来…… 丧尸病毒如燎原之火般迅猛蔓延，转瞬间，整座医院沦为恐怖的炼狱。 面目狰狞、张牙舞爪的丧尸横行其中，而惊慌失措的民众则在狭窄的过道与房间里仓皇奔逃，绝望的呼喊和凌乱的脚步声交织成一曲末日悲歌。 然而不巧的是，辛格的妻子“凛”身为医院的医生，此刻正在楼上与院长商讨着如何利用鱼肝为老板娘医治病症…… 众人尚在一头雾水、没弄清楚状况之时，组织便迅速下达指令，宣布对医院实施封锁，决意将院内所有人一并控制，以杜绝病毒扩散的风险。 辛格听闻消息后，心急如焚，瞬间暴起，如同一道黑色的闪电般疾冲向医院，只为营救妻子。 一路上，丧尸、怪物不断涌现，他却毫无惧色，铁拳挥舞间，丧尸纷纷倒地；飞腿扫过处，怪物连连哀嚎，恰似战神现世，一路无双。 先别感到荒诞，这恰恰就是本片的故事脉络。 影片没啥跌宕起伏的剧情，全程主要就是看男主如何暴揍丧尸。 更荒诞且诙谐的是，这些丧尸竟还能进行二次进化。 刚刚前一刻分明已经没了气息，可转瞬之间却又霍然站起，还化作了Labubu的模样。 简而言之，《尸杀泰拳》不过是一部裹着丧尸元素外衣的动作爽片罢了。 其剧情匮乏，深度更是无从谈起。 闲来无事的剧迷倒不妨下载来瞧瞧...,2025-07-17 17:54:32,zh,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The text is a detailed synopsis of a Thai zombie movie and only mentions ""Labubu"" briefly in a passing reference to zombie evolution, with no substantive connection to the Pop Mart-Labubu toy brand.

If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission. Long before Labubu, Takashi Murakami's anime-inspired Superflat characters were turning everything from Louis Vuitton Speedy bags to Major League Baseball gear into fashion gold. The Japanese artist is teaming again with Casetify on a second CoLab collection ($32 to $950) featuring his Kaikai and Kiki characters on tech accessories and travel gear. The whimsical duo (who represent innocence and mischief) and Murakami's signature Flowers are seen on customizable Impact cases for Apple, Google and Samsung devices, including iPhone 16 Pro Max, iPad, Galaxy Z Fold7 and Flip7, Pixel 9 Pro and other phone and tablet models. Casetify's new Bounce luggage also get the Murakami treatment with 21-inch carry-on and 29-inch trunk suitcases in glossy pink, black and red available for customization. The collection also includes collectible earbud cases (limited to two per person), phone case danglers, AirPods Pro 2 holders, Apple Watch bands, phone charms, laptop sleeves, Snappy cardholder stands, MagSafe-compatible wallets, two-in-one charging stands, magnetic wireless chargers, car chargers, grip stands and power banks. Phone case danglers come in blind boxes and contain Kaikai or Kiki in classic, sepia or mono colorways; they're limited to four per person. Murakami's Kaikai and Kiki are inspired by the works of prominent 16th-century Japanese painter Kanō Eitoku, and the playful characters represent “the dual forces that drive artistic expression and the spirit of collaboration at the heart of Murakami's world,” per a release. “I'm delighted that the next chapter of my collection has come to life on the modern canvas of Casetify,” Murakami explains in a statement. “Among my characters, Kaikai and Kiki are the only twin figures, embodying charm, mischief and a full spectrum of emotions.” The Casetify x Murakami Kaikai and Kiki collection is also popping in Los Angeles at Complex's store (433 N. Fairfax Ave.) from July 17 to 19. Casetify's flagship store in Dosan, South Korea, will also host special activations to celebrate the CoLab. Murakami first joined forces with Casetify last year for a collection that highlighted Mr. Dob, a manga-meets-Mickey Mouse character that the artist has said represents his alter ego. That capsule quickly sold out, so don't be surprised if Kaikai and Kiki also fly off the brand's virtual shelves. The Tokyo-born creative most recently celebrated the 20th anniversary of his Louis Vuitton collection, which was rereleased this year in two chapters. Zendaya starred in the French fashion house's campaign for the revived capsule, which as originally seen in the 2000s on Jennifer Lopez, Paris Hilton, Nicole Richie and others.

Ahora Netflix, anunció que la última temporada del fenómeno mundial “El Juego del Calamar” ayudó en las ganancias de la plataforma. Este sector se ha convertido en uno de los más importantes en el mundo, y según un informe de Statista, en 2024 el número de suscriptores globales a servicios de streaming superó los mil 500 millones, con Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, HBO Max, Apple TV+ y plataformas regionales como ViX y Claro Video liderando el mercado en América Latina. En México, datos del Instituto Federal de Telecomunicaciones (IFT) indican que más del 75 por ciento de los usuarios de internet consumen contenido en streaming, siendo YouTube y Netflix las más utilizadas. ¿Cuánto ganó Netflix de la nueva temporada de El Juego del Calamar? La última temporada del fenómeno mundial “El Juego del Calamar” ayudó a Netflix a superar las expectativas de ganancias de Wall Street para el segundo trimestre, según anunció el servicio de streaming el jueves, al tiempo que elevaba su previsión de ingresos para el año. Las acciones de la compañía, que habían subido casi un 44 por ciento este año antes del informe de resultados, cayeron casi un 2 por ciento, hasta los mil 252,94 dólares en las operaciones posteriores al cierre del mercado. La compañía afirmó que su mayor previsión de ingresos “refleja principalmente el debilitamiento del dólar estadounidense”. Entre abril y junio, Netflix registró ganancias diluidas por acción de 7,19 dólares. Esta cifra superó la estimación de consenso de 7,08 dólares de los analistas encuestados por LSEG. Ante eso, la compañía elevó su previsión de ingresos para 2025 de 44 mil 800 millones a 45 mil 200 millones de dólares, debido a la depreciación del dólar estadounidense, además del sólido crecimiento de miembros y las ventas de publicidad. Su previsión anterior era de hasta 44 mil 500 millones de dólares. Para el trimestre que acaba de finalizar, los ingresos netos alcanzaron los 3 mil 100 millones de dólares, superando las previsiones de 3 mil 060 millones de dólares. Los ingresos totalizaron 11 mil 080 millones de dólares, por encima de la proyección de los analistas de 11 mil 070 millones de dólares. Netflix lanzó la tercera y última temporada del drama distópico coreano “El Juego del Calamar” unos días antes de que finalizara el segundo trimestre de junio. La serie es la más popular de Netflix en lengua no inglesa en la historia del servicio de streaming. La tercera temporada acumuló 122 millones de visualizaciones, según Netflix. Otros estrenos durante el trimestre incluyen “Sirenas”, “Las Cuatro Estaciones” y la tercera temporada de “Ginny y Georgia”. El pionero del streaming de vídeo dejó de publicar sus cifras trimestrales de suscriptores este año, instando en su lugar a los inversores a centrarse en las ganancias como medida de su éxito. Afirmó que el crecimiento de suscriptores superó sus previsiones, pero se produjo a finales del trimestre, lo que limitó el impacto en los ingresos del segundo trimestre. Netflix ha estado desarrollando un servicio con publicidad para aumentar los ingresos y atraer a los espectadores sensibles al precio. También ha añadido eventos en directo, como la lucha libre de la WWE, para atraer a anunciantes y espectadores. De cara al futuro, Netflix pronosticó ingresos de 11 mil 500 millones de dólares y un beneficio neto de casi 3 mil millones de dólares. Los analistas habían proyectado 11 mil 300 millones de dólares y 2 mil 900 millones de dólares. La compañía también estrenará nuevas temporadas de dos de sus series más importantes a finales de este año. “Wednesday” regresa en agosto, y los episodios finales de “Stranger Things” se estrenarán en noviembre y diciembre.

　　美国众议院压倒性优势投票通过三大加密货币法案，白宫称特朗普周五签字 
　　稳定币监管相关《GENIUS》得到的赞成票是反对票的2.5倍，获100多名民主党议员“倒戈”支持。 周三晚，三大法案（CLARITY法案、反CBDC监控国家法案及GENIUS法案）在众议院的新一轮程序性投票中涉险过关，赞成票仅比反对票多五票。 因十多名共和党人“反水”，这些法案周二还在众院首次程序性投票中闯关失利。 目前众议院共和党领袖推动成为立法的三部法案均得到特朗普的支持。 它们旨在为数字资产行业建立清晰的监管框架，被视为美国加密货币政策的重要里程碑。 其中，《GENIUS》为“锚定”美元的稳定币制定监管框架。 特朗普将允许美国养老金投资黄金、加密货币、PE等另类资产 
　　据三位知情人士对媒体透露，特朗普最快本周就会签署该行政命令，允许401(k)退休计划投资于传统股票和债券之外的另类资产。 这些可投资的资产类别将涵盖广泛领域，包括数字资产、贵金属、专注于企业并购的基金、私人贷款项目及基础设施投资等。 在美国，401(k)是工薪阶层最常用的退休储蓄方式之一，允许个人将部分薪资投入于免税的公开市场证券。 目前几乎所有这类投资都集中在公开股票和债券型共同基金中。 美联储理事沃勒：劳动力市场紧张，FOMC应在本月降息25个基点

　　白宫管理和预算办公室（OMB）主任Russ Vought称美联储总部25亿美元翻修工程令人震惊，超支情况令特朗普愤怒。 OMB官员希望在一周左右对美联储进行实地访问。 美联储主席鲍威尔回应称，美联储总部翻修工程及其资金安排自始至终都受到美联储理事会及其监察机构的严格监管。 摩根大通：别太担心鲍威尔，美联储独立性本来就是“神话”，降息押注下美股将继续涨 
　　摩根大通表示，过去几十年来，对美联储的施压一直在“闭门进行”，并非特朗普时期的特例。 鲍威尔是否被解雇并不重要，重要的是鲍威尔任期即将到期，市场很快会意识到他实际上已经出局，并开始为下任主席的政策定价。 无论下一任主席是谁，鸽派的势力会越来越大，美股或在降息预期下继续上涨。 韩国股民加速配置中国资产：最爱小米，追捧比亚迪宁德时代及泡泡玛特

mov_F56C41149F858F6E9A621B7270240B7D,"  China is prepared to take measures and has a ""plentiful"" toolbox to avoid an economic slump in the second half of the year, its commerce minister said Friday as he admitted it faced a ""very severe and complex situation"". Growth hit 5.2 percent in the second quarter, official data showed Tuesday, but analysts have warned that more must be done to boost sluggish domestic consumption as exports face the knock-on effects of global trade turmoil. Retail sales rose far less than expected last month and were much weaker than May, suggesting efforts to kickstart consumption have fallen flat. ""We are still facing a very severe and complex situation. Global changes are unstable and uncertain. Some of our policies will provide some new responses according to the times and circumstances,"" Wang Wentao told journalists at a news briefing. ""Our toolbox is plentiful, and we will be fully prepared."" Asked specifically about China's reliance on exports, Wang suggested the government was preparing policies to ""further stimulate the momentum of our consumption development"". ""China's economy is improving, and the long-term fundamentals have not changed, the consumption market's characteristics of great potential, strong resilience and vitality have not changed,"" he said. Wang also namechecked Beijing-based toymaker Pop Mart, whose Labubu monster dolls have become a must-have item internationally, adorning the handbags of celebrities such as Rihanna and Dua Lipa.

इसका लुक भी काफी डरावना है। कुछ लोग इसे भुतही गुड़ि‍या कह रहे हैं तो कुछ इसे एक टॉय की तरह ही समझ रहे हैं। सबसे खास बात तो ये है क‍ि इसकी कीमत भी इन दिनों आसमान छू रही है और लोगों में इसका इतना क्रेज है कि इसे खरीदने के लिए लोग बेताब हो रहे हैं। तो आइए इसके बारे में व‍िस्‍तार से जानते हैं - Kasing Lung ने क‍िया था ड‍िजाइन आपको बता दें क‍ि इस डॉल को द मॉन्सटर सीरीज के तहत डिजाइन किया गया था। इसको साल 2015 में हांगकांग के आर्टिस्ट Kasing Lung ने बनाया था। उन्‍हें परियों की कहानी काफी पसंद थी। इसी से प्रेरित होकर उन्‍होंने इस गुड़‍िया को डिजाइन किया था। लेकिन, उस समय वो नहीं जानते थे कि 10 साल बाद इसकी ड‍िमांड इतनी बढ़ जाएगी। डरावनी है गुड़ि‍या की हंसी हालांक‍ि, इस गुड़‍िया की हंसी इतनी डरावनी है ज‍िसे लोग शैतानी हंसी मान रहे हैं। लेक‍िन कुछ लोगों को ये डॉल क्यूट लग रही है। इसकी बड़ी-बड़ी आंखे, शैतानी हंसी, नुकीले दांत हर क‍िसी के मन में सवाल पैदा कर रहे हैं। इस डॉल का अपना अलग लुक और स्टोरी है। Labubu एक काल्पनिक कैरेक्टर है, जो देखने में थोड़ी अजीब है लेकिन उतनाी ही क्यूट भी है। चीन से शुरू हुई इसके मशहूर होने की कहानी इसकी बॉडी इंसान जैसी होती है, लेकिन चेहरा किसी जानवर या कार्टून जैसा लगता है। यही वजह है कि ये डॉल इंटरनेट पर इतनी वायरल हो रही है। Labubu के मशहूर होने की कहानी चीन से शुरू हुई थी। जब वहां की एक जानी मानी कंपनी ने इसको 'ब्लाइंड बॉक्स' में बेचना शुरू क‍िया था। यह भी पढ़ें: क्या सचमुच अनलकी है 13वां नंबर?

1m2y8ip,"  I just randomly saw this article about orv movie so I got curious to read it cause of the title. First, it went on about how the director hoped the movie would help korean films reach global audiences and all that, and the actors feeling the pressure since the orv fandom is so big. Then it went on about indirectly saying how the director of the film seems so disinterested about the actual story. After all the glazing articles I keep on reading about the orv movie, someone finally said it. I think the real problem is, the director is so up in his arse about all the changes he made. Like, based on everything I read and saw about him and this movie, his ego is so up there. He feels extremely confident this won't flop obv because of the popular actors and actresses he casted, and his trust about putting and using the title of ORV. He expected the fandom to just suck it up, like, here, daym. It's more of a lack of respect to the og material tbh. Also, with how complex the story is, I don't even know who thought it was a good idea to make this into a movie? I know they plan to do it with 5 movies, but srsly, why movie? A series is the obv way to go. I feel bad for the actors but I hope the director gets slap on the face when this flops. I hope his labubu visits him on his dreams.","I just randomly saw this article about orv movie so I got curious to read it cause of the title.

With its unsettling smile and odd resemblance to the demon Pazuzu, social media users are questioning its origins. Is Labubu just a toy, or is there something darker behind its design? Theories and fear are spreading fast across platforms. In the age of viral trends and online conspiracies, even the cutest toys can take a dark turn—and that's exactly what's happening with the Labubu doll. What started as a quirky collectible has now become the center of eerie speculation, thanks to a viral video claiming The Simpsons predicted its rise. With its wide grin, bulging eyes, and uncanny resemblance to demonic figures like Pazuzu, social media is buzzing with questions: Is Labubu just another harmless toy, or is there something darker hiding behind its stitched smile? Labubu Doll Craze Sparks Viral Panic After 'Simpsons Prediction' Video Surfaces Online What began as a popular collectible among Gen Z has now taken a spooky turn. A viral video linking The Simpsons to the rise of the Labubu doll has the internet buzzing with conspiracy theories, unsettling comparisons to the demon Pazuzu, and questions about the toy's origins. Is this just another TikTok-fueled myth? Did The Simpsons Really Predict Labubu? Viral Clip Sparks Internet Frenzy A clip allegedly from The Simpsons showing a creepy toy resembling Labubu has gone viral across TikTok and Instagram Reels. Fans are calling it another accurate “Simpsons prediction,” adding the toy to the long list of strange and spooky things the show seems to foresee. While the video's authenticity remains unverified, it's been enough to spark paranoia about Labubu's sudden cultural rise. Labubu Doll and Pazuzu: Creepy Coincidence or Supernatural Symbolism? People on social media quickly noticed that the Labubu doll looks a lot like Pazuzu, the scary demon from the movie The Exorcist. Both have big, bulging eyes, wide grins full of teeth, and a creepy vibe. While some fans say Labubu is just a cute and fun toy, others think its design might be inspired by something darker—maybe even by scary legends or stories. Social Media Reacts: “There's Something Off About This Toy” Users across platforms like Twitter (X), Reddit, and Instagram are sharing mixed feelings about the doll. Comments range from humorous to genuinely disturbed. “The more I stare at Labubu, the more I feel watched.” “This is not just a plushie—it's possessed.” “Pazuzu in a Gen Z body.” The uncanny nature of Labubu's design is fueling thousands of duets, reaction videos, and paranormal discussions online. The Rise of Labubu Dolls: A Gen Z Obsession Turns Trendy and Terrifying Originally released as part of the “Zimomo and Friends” art toy line by Pop Mart, Labubu became a beloved collectible for its quirky, mischievous appearance. Gen Z quickly embraced it for aesthetic reasons, viral unboxing videos, and limited-edition drops. However, the recent weired associations have added a whole new layer to the obsession—blending cute culture with conspiracy theories. From Plush Toy to Paranormal Icon: Labubu's Viral Transformation Labubu's story mirrors how the internet transforms simple objects into modern myths. Much like Momo or Huggy Wuggy, Labubu has now crossed from innocent fandom into horror folklore territory. Whether it's driven by online algorithms, collective imagination, or real-life eeriness, Labubu has undeniably become more than just a plush toy—it's a phenomenon. The Labubu doll may have started as a fun collectible, but it's now caught in a storm of spooky theories and viral debates.

Social media users are debating whether it's just a quirky toy or something far more sinister. Its creepy smile and eerie resemblance to demonic figures have sparked widespread speculation. But is Labubu truly evil or just a misunderstood internet myth? What started as a quirky collectible has now become the center of weird internet discussions. The Labubu doll, once loved for its mischievous and cute appearance, is now being called “evil,” “haunted,” and even “demonic.” A wave of viral videos, alleged predictions by The Simpsons, and comparisons to dark entities like Pazuzu have pushed this harmless-looking plush toy into the middle of an online horror narrative. But what's really going on? Is Labubu just another toy caught in a trend—or is there something deeper and more disturbing? How Did the Labubu Doll Go Viral? According to reports, Labubu is a designer toy from the Pop Mart collection “Zimomo and Friends.” Known for its wide eyes, sharp teeth, and quirky grin, it gained popularity among Gen Z and collectors. Unboxing videos and limited-edition drops made it trendy on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest. But recently, the toy has gone viral for entirely different reasons. A video surfaced online claiming that The Simpsons predicted the rise of a toy that looks just like Labubu. This “prediction” sparked fear, as many people have grown to believe that The Simpsons often foreshadow real-world events in bizarre ways. Labubu and Pazuzu: Creepy Coincidence? Many users online have drawn eerie comparisons between Labubu and Pazuzu, the demon figure from the horror classic The Exorcist. Both figures have bulging eyes, toothy grins, and an unsettling aura. While some believe it's just a coincidence, others are convinced there's something intentionally dark about Labubu's design. These theories are spreading quickly on TikTok, where creators are posting side-by-side comparisons and asking: “Is Labubu just a toy—or something evil in disguise?” Social Media Reactions: Between Laughs and Fear The internet is divided. While some people make jokes about the doll being “possessed,” others genuinely feel uncomfortable having it in their homes. Comments like: “It's watching me while I sleep…” “Cute or cursed? I can't decide.” “No toy should have teeth like that!” …show just how much the internet has transformed Labubu from adorable to alarming. The Rise of Modern Toy Legends Labubu isn't the first toy to go from cute to creepy. Remember Momo, Huggy Wuggy, or even Annabelle? Internet culture has a way of turning ordinary objects into horror legends overnight. What makes Labubu unique is the mix of pop culture predictions, real-world merchandise, and psychological eeriness wrapped in one strange little doll. Is Labubu Actually Evil? From a logical perspective—no. Labubu is a stylized art toy, designed for collectors and fans of urban toys. There's no evidence of any supernatural connection. But from a cultural and digital point of view, Labubu has now taken on a life of its own. The more people speculate and post spooky stories, the more Labubu becomes a symbol of modern digital-age folklore—where even a doll can become the villain of a virtual ghost story. So, is the Labubu doll truly evil? Probably not. But the fear surrounding it is real—and that says a lot about how the internet works today. What we see, share, and believe can quickly turn cute into creepy. Whether you see Labubu as harmless or haunted, one thing is clear: this is one toy that won't be forgotten anytime soon.

mov_70FF3D23A8FE3FEACD96725B21F21655,"  Written by: Kyra (24-O3) Designed by: Julianna (24-E6) I am an avid collector. This urge to collect has always been a large part of who I am, dating back to when I was a child and kept a jar of interesting seeds I would find on my walks. Over the course of my life, I have been steadily growing a collection of little trinkets and keepsakes, each with its own story behind it. It is incredibly pleasing to walk through my home and see them sprinkled everywhere – my journal contains cute business cards, postcards from every country I visit, and interesting stickers. My phone proudly sports a Smiski Hipper, a small army of Sylvanian Families resides next to my bed, and my desk is slowly being overtaken by various figurines from Popmart. Some of my own collection  Throughout history, we see evidence of people collecting, as rows and rows of knick-knacks displayed in museums proudly showcase memorabilia spanning centuries of human life. A thousand years ago, people were preserving their favourite shells, mini sculptures, and tools. And a thousand years later, people are still doing the same thing. My father collects figurines of his favourite comic book heroes, my mother collects niche stamps, my brother collects Pokemon cards, and my sister collects cards of K-Pop idols. Some people commit to amassing Miffy-related merchandise, sneakers, or music records. There's a girl who frequently pops up on my TikTok 'For You Page' who possesses a remarkable determination to collect as many of the discontinued Crayola Dandelion crayons as she can. Just last week, I stumbled across another TikTok page dedicated to collecting every variation of Heinz's sauce packets. (@_lakenzo_ and @hudsonstuffy respectively, if you are interested) People have always had the innate urge to collect. But what is the reason behind collecting? Why does anyone do it at all? To me, collecting is a way to express personal identity and control in the material world. It is building a mosaic of everything I have ever loved, to remind myself that “Hey, you loved this once, this made you happy.” Even though we grow and become different people over time, we leave behind pieces of each version of us. By collecting, you attain a visual tapestry of your interests and personality over time, which can help you figure out what you actually like and dislike, and think about what is truly meaningful to yourself, something that is especially important in today's fast-paced world where we move from trend to trend so quickly without stopping. And, if I'm being honest, it also appeals to my ego to show off my collection of shiny trinkets to all my friends — like a particularly oddly-shaped magpie. Of course, everyone has their own reasons for collecting. It could be to create monuments to fond memories, to represent a goal to work towards, to remind themselves of things that are important to them, or it could even just be to have something pretty to hold, display, and admire. Sigmund Freud himself had a collection of over 2000 antiquities, including statues, vases, busts, and more, which served as visual sources of inspiration for his work. It was this collection of artefacts and the archaeology behind them that inspired his metaphors for the process of delving into the unconscious mind and the excavation of the psyche. Nonetheless, not everyone can have their very own collection of priceless statues and historical treasures. However, there are countless other little objects that people collect too. The latest viral collectables, such as Sonny Angels and Smiskis, are an increasingly common thing for people to collect, especially among teenage girls. The 'blind box' element adds an even greater incentive to get more of them and try your luck. It seems as though more and more people are getting invested in this hobby of collecting, and for good reason. Smiski Sunday Series. Smiskis are a collectible that has recently seen a surge in popularity due to its unique features. Although they were first created in 2009, they have only recently gone viral on social media. They are charming little bald figurines, with the ability to glow in the dark. They possess a wide variety of poses, all full of personality and capturing little snapshots in life, which contrasts with their blank faces and soulless eyes. Smiskis have been described as whimsical and aesthetically pleasing additions to households. Sonny Angel Dinosaur Series. Sonny Angels is another viral sensation on social media platforms. They were, like the Smiskis, first created 20 years ago in 2005. The Sonny Angels are cherub-like figurines with tiny wings and a wide range of colourful headgear. Their popularity is attributed to their adorable baby-like features, cheeky smiles, and innocent aura. People online have described them as “a source of comfort and smiles, like an emotional support cherub”. The Monsters COCA-COLA Series. Certain Popmart figurines have also gone viral. The Monsters Series, also known as Labubus, were propelled into the limelight after the K-pop idol LISA was seen carrying one around on her handbag. Labubus are furry, elf-like creatures with sharp teeth and massive grins. They have a uniquely playful and mischievous appearance, which makes them stand out from other Popmart figurines. Additionally, it has become a trend to film your Labubu in different countries when you go on vacation as if it was your travel companion. Sylvanian Families. Sylvanian Families is a much older collectible. First created in 1985, this collectible is perhaps one that is more familiar to our parent's generation, but its popularity remains steady even to this day....","Written by: Kyra (24-O3) Designed by: Julianna (24-E6) I am an avid collector.

mov_D1AA54FB38FA2033F5E036FAB8DFD0C3,"  China has a ""plentiful"" toolbox to avoid an economic slump in the second half of the year, its commerce minister said Friday as he admitted it faced a ""very severe and complex situation"". Growth hit 5.2 percent in the second quarter, official data showed Tuesday, but analysts have warned that more must be done to boost sluggish domestic consumption as exports face the knock-on effects of global trade turmoil. Retail sales rose far less than expected last month and were much weaker than May, suggesting efforts to kickstart consumption have fallen flat. ""We are still facing a very severe and complex situation. Global changes are unstable and uncertain. Some of our policies will provide some new responses according to the times and circumstances,"" Wang Wentao told journalists at a news briefing. ""Our toolbox is plentiful, and we will be fully prepared."" Asked specifically about China's reliance on exports, Wang suggested the government was preparing policies to ""further stimulate the momentum of our consumption development"". ""China's economy is improving, and the long-term fundamentals have not changed, the consumption market's characteristics of great potential, strong resilience and vitality have not changed,"" he said. Wang also namechecked Beijing-based toymaker Pop Mart, whose Labubu monster dolls have become a must-have item internationally, adorning the handbags of celebrities such as Rihanna and Dua Lipa. ""We are also promoting new forms of consumption... for example Pop Mart, these kinds of new trends, new fashions and styles... the Labubu phenomenon has swept the world,"" he said. - US decoupling 'impossible' - Beijing is battling to shift towards a growth model propelled more by domestic demand than the traditional key drivers of infrastructure investment, manufacturing and exports. That desired transformation has become more urgent since Donald Trump came to office. The US president has imposed tolls on China and most other major trading partners, upending trade norms and endangering Beijing's exports at a time it needs them more than ever to stimulate economic activity. The two superpowers have sought to de-escalate their row after reaching a framework for a deal at talks in London last month, but observers warn of lingering uncertainty. Wang said Friday that despite ""storms and rain"", Washington remained an important trading partner. Even though China-US trade has declined proportionally for each country, overall bilateral trade has remained stable, Wang said. In a sign of progress, US tech giant Nvidia said this week that it would resume sales of its H20 artificial intelligence chips to China after Washington pledged to remove licensing restrictions that had halted exports. China's commerce ministry acknowledged the US decision in a statement Friday afternoon, even as it called for Washington to ""abandon its zero-sum mentality"". ""China believes that the United States should... continue to cancel a series of unreasonable economic and trade restrictive measures,"" the statement read. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has met with Chinese leaders this week in Beijing, telling journalists Wednesday that his firm was ""doing our best"" to serve the country's vast semiconductor market. Wang praised recent visits by Huang and other US executives on Friday, noting that the solid economic and popular basis for US-China cooperation ""makes artificial decoupling and severing supply chains impossible"", he said. Yet an inconsistent tune has ""severely impacted and disrupted normal trade cooperation between China and the United States"", said Wang. Since Trump's first term, ""the trend of the trade frictions provoked by the United States has had ups and downs"", he said.

UgxiyXllFt9wWEw-Hip4AaABAg,"  Hey I wanna weigh in here as a christian who actually does like labubu and owns some. This is definitely a gripe that I share against some people that call themselves christians. I hate this jumping on the banwagon mentality that some christians have. As a christian we are supposed to have spiritual discernment. Questioning things is supposed to be how we grow in our faith and understanding. So I didn't understand when I started hearing pastors get up on pulpits and talk about how we should just agree that this toy is demonic and therefore we should get rid of all of them if we have any. That's what led me to do my research, and my research pretty much came back saying exactly what you said in this video. So ill make a point list to explain. 1) pazuzu is based on Mesopotamian mythology so why as Christians are we using that doctrine to validate our panic? Make it make sense. If Christianity is supposed to be the true religion, then why the heck do we believe things of other religions at all?Why do we pay any mind to it? 2) the main argument I kept hearing from a lot of people when I started doing my research was just like what you said that they just ""look ugly"" and the name labubu sounds eerily similar. Like ok? And? That doesnt mean anything! It honestly feels like it's just rooted in one person's opinion that they look ""demonic"" and then everyone just kind of ran with it. I believe as christians we should agree on the truths of the Bible yes, but some have twisted the labubu argument into being a biblical debate and its just not its opinion based at best and not even a good opinion backed up with facts 😂. 3) why is it that these things have been around for like 10 years but only just now, when they've gotten popular, do a bunch of christians suddenly come out that they have a problem with it? Like yall hadnt even heard of these 5 years ago! Why the fuss now? 4) Its fiction like harry potter. So fun little back story. I grew up in a christian home during the time of the pokemon and harry potter panic. My mom specifically felt these 2 things were satanic and evil bacause thats what Focus on the Family told her to believe (IYKYK). But now guess what? She loves harry potter and has read all the books and seen all the movies.And she recognizes that it's fiction. My mom is also a video gamer.And she's played quite a few pokemon games!

Der chinesische Hersteller und Händler Pop Mart wird am 25. Juli in Berlin sein erstes Geschäft hierzulande eröffnen. Wird der Labubu-Trend länger bleiben? Spielzeuge, die eine Zeit lang nicht nur Kinder, sondern auch Erwachsene begeistern, gab es schon häufiger. Zum Beispiel das Tamagotchi, ein kleines Gerät, mithilfe dessen man ein kleines Lebewesen umsorgen musste. Oder die Fidget Spinner, eine Art Kreisel mit Kugellager, mit denen man in der Hand Tricks machen konnte.

In den Geschäften tummeln sich immer wieder Sammler, die mit Bedacht die Überraschungsboxen schütteln, um zu erahnen, welche Figur sich darin befinden könnte. Wer jedoch auf Nummer sicher gehen will, versucht, online eine zu ergattern. Doch auch neue Labubu-Serien waren online zuletzt oft binnen Sekunden ausverkauft. Auf Second-Hand-Plattformen stiegen die Durchschnittspreise für die Tierchen deshalb deutlich. ""Ein Grund, weshalb ich Labubus gekauft habe, ist, weil ich glaube, dass sie ihren Wert halten"", sagt eine Sammlerin der Deutschen Presse-Agentur in Peking. Gut finde sie, dass die Figuren nun meist als Anhänger verkauft würden, sodass man sie mit sich herumtragen könne. Schattenseiten des Hypes Für den 2010 gegründeten Spielzeugverkäufer Pop Mart blüht das Geschäft. Im ersten Quartal dieses Jahres stieg der Umsatz des Spielzeughändlers nach eigenen Angaben um 165 bis 170 Prozent im Vergleich zum selben Vorjahresquartal, wie aus einer Mitteilung an der Hongkonger Börse hervorging. Eine Anfrage zur Strategie des Unternehmens ließ Pop Mart unbeantwortet. Die Popularität der wertvollen Figuren ließ bereits Fälschungen in Umlauf geraten, die etwa der chinesische Zoll fand.

Zudem schritt die Finanzaufsicht in Teilen Chinas bereits ein, als eine Bank Neukunden mit Labubu-Boxen bei einer Konto-Neueröffnung anwarb.

Call these gremlin keychain dolls that adults actually hang off their Miu Miu and Birkin bags ugly or cute – even demonic, as is claimed by conspiracy theorists on TikTok – I don't care. All I know is I can't get my hands on one. That's because they are a global sensation – and demand is so high they sell out in seconds. Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the Labubu doll, reported this week that it expects at least for the first six months of 2025, as revenues more than tripled, no doubt helped by the fact Labubus became a popular fashion accessory earlier this year among celebrities including Dua Lipa and Rihanna – before trickling down to the rest of us. But now, as the craze sweeps through primary schools, misguided mums like me are blindly rushing to buy these toys with furry bodies, wide prominent eyes and a toothy grin. I unknowingly bought two fake ones – otherwise known as a Lafufu – at my local mini supermarket for £10 each. But they fell apart, a common issue apparently, according to local authorities across the UK and Europe, who are warning against it due to choking hazards and toxic chemicals – and confiscating counterfeit products in bulk. This week's haul includes 32 keyrings and 95 boxes of counterfeit Labubus seized from the Pontypridd area in Wales. And according to the BBC, more than 370 of the dolls were confiscated in North Ayrshire, Scotland recently due to safety concerns. Rochdale Borough Council sent a toy safety alert on Facebook this month alongside a photo of a fake Labubu doll. In my case, we bought the Monsters Big into Energy Vinyl Plush Blind Box – albeit fake. But a day later the eye fell out of my seven-year-old Liberty's purple “Labubu” known as Luck, and then the red one that Lola, nine, got, called Love, had 10 teeth not nine, and she was teased at school for having the wrong one. But it turns out these problems are the tip of the iceberg. I'm now losing my mind over Labubu dolls – and Lafufus. A dad friend replaced our fraggled Lafufus at a hardware store in London's North End Road – naively believing they were the real thing. But they also disintegrated. As I fell deeper into the Labubu universe, I worked out how to tell the difference between a real and a . Mainly, it's the presence of a QR code on the back of the packaging, which should take you to the official Pop Mart website. So traumatised were the kids by now that I googled how to buy them real ones from Pop Mart – the only place to buy them direct, or on Amazon from their online shop. But it's near impossible to get one. Demand for Labubus is so high, rare dolls are being resold for £1,500 each – some online cost from about £54.99 to £99, but you can't be sure they are real. Next, I ended up marching the kids to a Pop Mart store in a Westfield shopping centre, but to our absolute horror, there was not one plush toy Labubu to be seen on any shelf. Pop Mart temporarily of Labubu dolls in its UK stores earlier this year to address safety concerns arising from the high demand and resulting pandemonium by obsessed customers during restock. Clearly this situation has not changed. I walked up to the cash till, with both my children, who I have to embarrassingly admit were now sobbing, and asked how on earth this could be possible. No Labubus? I was then told the only way to buy a Labubu was to enter a live launch draw for free. It felt like applying for a mortgage as I signed up for a chance to purchase one for £17.50 from the Monsters Big into Energy Series - Vinyl Plush Pendant Blind Box by manically adding in tons of details before the cut off in a few hours. I was advised to request more than one Labubu to increase the likelihood of winning it. I could always cancel extra ones at the point of purchase – I requested the maximum total of six dolls. We waited until Monday morning for the results, but we didn't make it through. My children, by this point, were floored by not having a Labubu. On every street corner, Labubus started to haunt us. As we went to a children's ballet with Lola's class four friends in Piccadilly Circus, they ran over to street vendors selling gruesome fakes for £15 begging me to buy them. “They are real, mum, look!” Other mums would call me from near Selfridges claiming to have found originals for around £60 – but I wanted to be sure I got the real deal. The silver lining is that – according to Pop Mart – I'll have a better chance of winning next time. “You missed out this time, so your EQLizer has increased,” I'm told. God alone knows when the next live launch is. It's now an obsession – logging in and checking twice daily so I can apply. Every day, my children ask me if I'm getting anywhere.

It's ironic that the Labubus my children want are called Love, Happiness, Loyalty, Serenity, Hope and Luck – since getting one is such a horror show....","“Can I have a Labubu – pleassssse, mum?” This is all I hear day in, day out from my young children. Call these gremlin keychain dolls that adults actually hang off their Miu Miu and Birkin bags ugly or cute – even demonic, as is claimed by conspiracy theorists on TikTok – I don't care. All I know is I can't get my hands on one. That's because they are a global sensation – and demand is so high they sell out in seconds. Pop Mart, the Chinese company behind the Labubu doll, reported this week that it expects at least for the first six months of 2025, as revenues more than tripled, no doubt helped by the fact Labubus became a popular fashion accessory earlier this year among celebrities including Dua Lipa and Rihanna – before trickling down to the rest of us. But now, as the craze sweeps through primary schools, misguided mums like me are blindly rushing to buy these toys with furry bodies, wide prominent eyes and a toothy grin. I unknowingly bought two fake ones – otherwise known as a Lafufu – at my local mini supermarket for £10 each. But they fell apart, a common issue apparently, according to local authorities across the UK and Europe, who are warning against it due to choking hazards and toxic chemicals – and confiscating counterfeit products in bulk. This week's haul includes 32 keyrings and 95 boxes of counterfeit Labubus seized from the Pontypridd area in Wales. And according to the BBC, more than 370 of the dolls were confiscated in North Ayrshire, Scotland recently due to safety concerns. Rochdale Borough Council sent a toy safety alert on Facebook this month alongside a photo of a fake Labubu doll. In my case, we bought the Monsters Big into Energy Vinyl Plush Blind Box – albeit fake. But a day later the eye fell out of my seven-year-old Liberty's purple “Labubu” known as Luck, and then the red one that Lola, nine, got, called Love, had 10 teeth not nine, and she was teased at school for having the wrong one. But it turns out these problems are the tip of the iceberg. I'm now losing my mind over Labubu dolls – and Lafufus. A dad friend replaced our fraggled Lafufus at a hardware store in London's North End Road – naively believing they were the real thing. But they also disintegrated. As I fell deeper into the Labubu universe, I worked out how to tell the difference between a real and a . Mainly, it's the presence of a QR code on the back of the packaging, which should take you to the official Pop Mart website. So traumatised were the kids by now that I googled how to buy them real ones from Pop Mart – the only place to buy them direct, or on Amazon from their online shop. But it's near impossible to get one. Demand for Labubus is so high, rare dolls are being resold for £1,500 each – some online cost from about £54.99 to £99, but you can't be sure they are real. Next, I ended up marching the kids to a Pop Mart store in a Westfield shopping centre, but to our absolute horror, there was not one plush toy Labubu to be seen on any shelf. Pop Mart temporarily of Labubu dolls in its UK stores earlier this year to address safety concerns arising from the high demand and resulting pandemonium by obsessed customers during restock. Clearly this situation has not changed. I walked up to the cash till, with both my children, who I have to embarrassingly admit were now sobbing, and asked how on earth this could be possible. No Labubus? I was then told the only way to buy a Labubu was to enter a live launch draw for free. It felt like applying for a mortgage as I signed up for a chance to purchase one for £17.50 from the Monsters Big into Energy Series - Vinyl Plush Pendant Blind Box by manically adding in tons of details before the cut off in a few hours. I was advised to request more than one Labubu to increase the likelihood of winning it. I could always cancel extra ones at the point of purchase – I requested the maximum total of six dolls. We waited until Monday morning for the results, but we didn't make it through. My children, by this point, were floored by not having a Labubu. On every street corner, Labubus started to haunt us. As we went to a children's ballet with Lola's class four friends in Piccadilly Circus, they ran over to street vendors selling gruesome fakes for £15 begging me to buy them. “They are real, mum, look!” Other mums would call me from near Selfridges claiming to have found originals for around £60 – but I wanted to be sure I got the real deal. The silver lining is that – according to Pop Mart – I'll have a better chance of winning next time. “You missed out this time, so your EQLizer has increased,” I'm told. God alone knows when the next live launch is. It's now an obsession – logging in and checking twice daily so I can apply. Every day, my children ask me if I'm getting anywhere. I feel a sense of failure. Their friend got one in Finland – can we go there? A Labubu feels so near, yet so far away. I have lost all perspective. I don't even get why people like them. It's taking over my waking day.

Malgré sa popularité, le candidat n'a pas souhaité aller au bout de son aventure. Une décision qui sème l'incompréhension du côté de ses nombreux fans. S'il y a bien un candidat qui aura marqué cette nouvelle saison de Secret Story, c'est bel et bien Mayer, jeune candidat de 24 ans et originaire de Paris. Dès le début de l'aventure, il s'est lié d'amitié avec Romy et notamment Ethan, ses noyaux durs de l'aventure. Il s'est distingué auprès des téléspectateurs de par son profil mystérieux et discret. Un grand joueur qui faisait peur à l'intérieur de la maison. À tel point que les autres candidats l'ont mis dans le sas cette semaine. Fort heureusement pour ses fans, le stratège a réussi à regagner la Maison puisque c'est Pimprenelle et Adrien qui sont sortis de l'aventure… et ont déjà été vus ensemble à Paris ! Mais coup de théâtre ! Depuis quelques heures, les internautes évoquent sur Tik Tok un potentiel départ de Mayer, qui s'était embrouillé avec Pimprenelle avant le départ de la jeune femme. Plusieurs éléments ont mis la puce à l'oreille aux internautes. D'une part, le fait que le jeune homme n'ait pas été aperçu dans le live puis aussi que ses comptes étaient particulièrement actifs sur les réseaux sociaux, bien qu'officiellement géré par son frère jumeau. Mayer quitte Secret Story : les raisons de son départ bientôt dévoilées Mais ce samedi 19 juillet, TF1 a annoncé que Mayer avait bel et bien claqué la porte. “Mayer a décidé de quitter l'aventure Secret Story. C'est un choix qu'il a mûrement réfléchi, et que nous respectons, ainsi que tous les habitants. Il a retrouvé ses proches et tout va pour le mieux pour lui”, peut-on lire dans ce message qui n'en dit pas plus sur les raisons de Mayer d'interompre son aventure : “Cette décision lui appartient et il s'exprimera sur les raisons de son départ”, peut-on lire. Dans les commentaires, les internautes n'en croient pas leurs yeux : “Comme dirait Vivian : la production, c'est FINI pour vous ! Vous avez ruiné cette saison qui avait tout pour être une des meilleures de l'histoire du programme.

UgyYWkIO-X1DhcV7XVp4AaABAg,"  Hey kass I've been a subscriber for a pretty long time and I think my favorite labubu would've have to be dada. I know a lot of people think it's creepy but I think the eyes are just adorable. I think a really fun idea for a video could be titled something like this, “SIBLING UNBOXING BATTLE: TikTok Mystery Boxes! 💥📦” Each sibling gets a TikTok-inspired mystery box filled with random viral items (trending products, weird Amazon finds, aesthetic gadgets, slime, mini waffle makers, LED glasses, etc.). They take turns unboxing and scoring each other's items on a scale of “TikTok Hype Level.” The twist? They don't just open it — they have to use or try the item on the spot… no matter how ridiculous it is. Round 1: The Aesthetic Item •Each sibling unboxes one cute/fun viral item (like a mini sunset lamp, cloud projector, kawaii stationery). •They have 30 seconds to make a mini TikTok with it. •Other siblings rate it: “Would this go viral? Y/N?” Round 2: The Weird Amazon Find •Think: magnetic slime, fidget toys, voice-changer mic, fake bugs, or something oddly specific. •Try to guess what it is before opening. •If you guess wrong, the others get to prank you with the item. Round 3: The Mini Challenge Item •Box includes a trending TikTok game or product (e.g., TikTok jelly fruit, tiny kitchen, spinning wheel of dares). •Everyone has to participate in a mini challenge with it. •Last sibling to finish the challenge gets a sticker labeled “TikTok Fail” on their forehead. Final Round: The Viral Clone •Each sibling pulls out one random viral product knock-off (e.g., fake Stanley cup, mini ring light, faux Drunk Elephant dupe). •Try it out, give an honest (and funny) review. •End by voting whose box was most “TikTok-worthy.” And a twist you could add could be, Add a “Secret Item” planted by a parent or older sibling — something cringey from childhood (a baby photo, old toy, embarrassing drawing) hidden inside the TikTok fun. This adds humor and surprise. This is why it works: •Combines unboxing, competition, chaos, trends — everything TikTok loves. •Encourages reactions, duets, and stitching. •Perfect for multiple videos — each box = one TikTok. I think this might just be one of my best idea yet. I really hope to win this, but if I don't good luck to everyone else. ❤❤","Hey kass I've been a subscriber for a pretty long time and I think my favorite labubu would've have to be dada.

 1.為工作賦以意義感
 不少研究都指出，職場新世代求職的考慮不只是薪酬高低，而是工作是否具有意義。 兩位化妝品銷售員被問及工作任務是甚麼時，員工A回答「我正在為公司推銷新產品來增加業績。」 員工B則表示「我在推廣可以令熟齡人士看上去更年輕的方法。」 管理人可以「Story telling」方式跟員工分享其工作背後的正面意義，讓員工明白企業的使命和願景，創造出工作意義感和歸屬感。 2.給予成就感與重視
 根據神經經濟學的研究指出，金錢獎勵主要激活大腦「紋狀體」，其興奮度會隨重複刺激快速遞減（習慣化效應），其激勵作用只能維持3個月。 成就感則激活「前額葉皮質」，引發持續的目標導向行為，成為持久的工作動力。 非金錢的獎勵包括晉升機會、提高職銜、公開讚賞、密切跟進需要等，都是對員工作出重視和讚賞的實際行動。 由於不同年資的員工有不同需要，宜個別化處理，並嚴肅跟進，但切忌開空頭支票。 3.創造心理安全感
 心理安全感指的是員工在工作中能夠展現真實的自我，不必擔心因表達意見或犯錯而遭受負面後果。 研究顯示，企業內部的包容文化和對員工的支持能夠顯著提高團隊的心理安全感。 有公司的管理層定期到前線單位探訪，積極聆聽員工心聲並作出回應，這類交流活動可增加員工之間的信任度。 也有不少企業特意為管理人提供職場溝通培訓，讓管理人學習善意批評的溝通技巧，依次為客觀事實、影響、建議及鼓勵，以培養安全的溝通環境。 4.關注員工身心健康
 越來越多香港僱員著重身心健康，職場心理健康將被視為求職剛需。 不少企業引入僱員輔助計劃（Employee Assistance Program），委托專業機構為其員工提供輔導服務。 亦會為有特別需要的群組提供協助方案，如專為回流香港工作或產假復工的員工而設計的重返職場計劃（Return-to-Work Program），協助來港專才而設計的生活適應課程等。 這些都讓員工感到被重視、被關懷、被照顧的情緒價值。 總結而言，在這個智慧型和資訊發達的年代，現今社會追求的不再只是物質回報，長期使用單一的激勵策略已無法滿足需求。 紅姐事件、Labubu與Chikawa熱潮正反映了現今社會重視情感需要。 不論是搶人才或是挽留人才，管理者需要反思一下自己的領導風格和企業措施是否到位。 吳慧琪

周杰倫以IP「周同學」進駐抖音，市場追捧幕後推手概念股巨星傳奇（6683），股價一度單日最高盤中暴升兩倍，另邊廂武打巨星李連杰亦進駐抖音，一天粉絲增加140萬，入駐快手的兩日播放量接近8000萬，快手股價連日上漲。 然而「周同學」《抖音》至今只有3條短片，資金是否純屬炒作，抑或是追捧背後的盈利模式，以下跟大家一同探討。 下載Yahoo財經APP
美股外幣即時報價 多國新聞任睇
周杰倫以IP「周同學」進駐抖音，概念股巨星傳奇（06683）獲追捧，到底有什麼新營運模式？ 被譽為「明星IP第一股」的巨星傳奇於2023年7月13日在港交所上市，主要業務為IP創造及營運與新零售，以稀缺明星IP販賣授權，模式隨巨星上市早已出現。 巨星由周杰倫母親葉惠美、經紀人楊峻榮、前魔傑電競CEO馬心婷、周杰倫經紀公司執行高管陳中共同創立，在業內一向被稱為「周杰倫概念股」，亦有一直製作《周遊記》等戶外實境互動綜藝。 雖然一直都有IP＋新零售加持，但股價在上市後，自去年中以來一直積弱，至近日「周同學」進駐抖音，巨星股價才終於創下上市以來新高。 巨星傳奇業務總共分為IP創造及營運，與新消費兩大板塊。 前者主要內容圍繞為藝人「打造人設和內容IP」；話說在前，藝人的傳統商業價值不同於IP價值，從前再受歡迎的影視藝人，到了今天，也需要透過轉化成為IP人設，才能「變現」或「重現」其商業價值，而巨星傳奇與一般IP培育企業不同的是，巨星主要承接明星的價值轉化工作；新消費主要是IP授權販賣產品或服務，以「周同學」IP為例子，新消費（或新零售）涵蓋時尚、文創、3C、食品及貴金屬5大核心領域，據報去年聯名產品銷售額超過10億港元。 兩年前《周遊記2》在浙江衛視開播，當時市場已在熱議巨星傳奇的「生意經」
兩年前《周遊記2》在浙江衛視開播，當時市場已在熱議巨星傳奇的「生意經」，受惠的除了特約贊助的快手和最酒聯合、合作夥伴奇妙積木外，還有獨家冠名的魔胴咖啡。 魔胴咖啡是巨星傳奇旗下的中國防彈飲料市場的王牌產品，換言之冠名贊助的也是屬於旗下的品牌，當時市場形容為「商業化閉環」模式，巨星傳奇利用經營自己的IP，來帶動自己品牌的銷量。 一般而言，市場很難在巨星傳奇身上找到其他零售個股受惠的消息，因為在「閉環」之下，其他零售企業同時也是其新零售的競爭對手。 在巨星傳奇早已試水「新零售」，去年中秋「周同學愛次元空間」全國首展，「愛在西元前咖啡店」賣周杰倫限量飲品、有AI機器人的互動街區、「周同學」快閃店賣產品，「周同學」在杭州、福州、長沙等地曾經掀起過熱潮。 去年「周同學」亮相東京塔的巡迴快閃也引起過市場熱議，但為何股價到了今天才創歷數新高？ 是否在IP領域以外，市場還出現了新的內容需求？ 李連杰進軍抖音、快手以及小紅書，卻被網民質疑「老李過氣了」
另一武打巨星李連杰近日亦因進駐抖音和快手重回公眾視線引起熱話。 市場資訊瞬間萬變，李連杰進軍抖音、快手以及小紅書，但市場很快潑李連杰冷水，內地網民指他在抖音的流量不如2021年已紅進駐的劉德華，評價「老李過氣了，就幾百萬粉絲」，甚至有文章形容這次「功夫皇帝跌落神壇」。 不過細心拆解李連杰的「人設」，可了解到其盈利模式並不在於要高量流直接變現，似乎是另有所圖，更需要流量「質素」。 李連杰曾經分享回到公眾視野的三大原因，分別是「分享多年武術經驗和人生哲學」、「從小習武形成獨特人生視角」、「系統性分享武術文化和電影發展」，而他的抖音內容主要圍繞經典電影、武術產業和人生教培，並強調不參與直播帶貨。 換言之，李連杰進駐抖音的賺錢模式，很可能會延伸到平台之外的武術教學、武術類電影票房以及擁有經典武術片庫的電視台。 在另一武打巨星成龍的新電影連番失利之際，市場正需要是一位輩份並不低的武打巨星出來為武術電影及其產業指路，李連杰「人設」的價值，有待體現在相關產業之中，視乎會否有助提升「武打片」的市場價值，視乎流量變現時的「轉化率」，粉絲會否因他的內容而學習武術。 李連杰曾經分享回到公眾視野的三大原因，分別是「分享多年武術經驗和人生哲學」、「從小習武形成獨特人生視角」、「系統性分享武術文化和電影發展」
李連杰與「周同學」在平台的內容有一共通點，就是「周同學」目前有1592萬瀏覽的抖音首發視頻，跟李連杰大部分影片圍繞的主題差不多，都有人生主題，「周同學」的影片更明顯是極像近日在外國社交平台大為流行以AI生成的日本明星演藝史的成長影片，透過影片來與粉絲一同回顧人生。 在《2024抖音熱點年度數據報告》中，似乎可以看到一些端倪。 根據抖音2024年的娛樂熱門趨勢，原來短片內容開始流行一些演藝界人士的人物故事，例如自白體或「人物志」類的短片，同時需要「內容有思辨的味道」，意味影片不再停留在娛樂效果享受，而是希望開放討論演員的人生價值觀，據報抖音上有一個熱門tag便是「#人生啊真是匆匆」，相關短片訴說舊日影星如成龍、周星馳逝去的歲月，也有在歲月中逝去的影星如張國榮、林正英、吳孟達。 資料顯示，短劇界早已懂得人生題材的價值。 短劇其中兩個長青的題材便是穿越與人生重來，這類感慨人生的內容需求，正正是近年短劇產業價值暴增的題材優勢。 短劇單劇的播放量可以高達10億，而2024年中國一共製作了超過3萬部微短劇，總收入達504億元人民幣，據報已經超過了中國電影票房收入，還未計在海外瘋狂增長的產業鏈。 恰巧上述的《抖音》熱點報告顯示，去年抖音的十大短劇Top3，亦有「重生之我在短劇裡當保姆」，反映人生故事的確受到歡迎。 「周同學」目前有1592萬瀏覽的抖音首發視頻，極像近日在外國社交平台大為流行的日本明星演藝史的成長影片，透過影片來與粉絲一同回顧人生（《抖音》「周同學」）
換言之，「周同學」進駐抖音背後的啟示，或許本來就是配合平台更大的內容趨勢，例如人生教練類的深度故事內容需求，市場正渴求一些能夠富有人生縱向發展與回顧的內容等等。 在這內容方向下，再來分析巨星進駐短片平台最可能的賺錢機會。 在抖音只發布了3條影片試水溫的周杰倫，未來會不會接下「抖音短劇」拍攝，題材穿越到一些過去他影視作品的場景（例如回到《不能說的秘密》），衍生一些以「回到過去」或打開「半島鐵盒」式的人生短劇？ 若然這類人生短劇可行，或啟示到同樣擁有明星IP的TVB，可能又多一個開拓生意的渠道。 資料顯示，現時市場並不缺乏開發IP的企業，港股「IP三傑」分別是泡泡瑪特（9992）、名創優品（9896）、布魯可（0325），三者當中似乎只有泡泡瑪特能夠做到像巨星傳奇般的「商業化閉環」，自己明星級數IP自己賣，加上其IP是二次元屬性，難以開發深度故事內容，目前市場幾乎就只有日本IP擁有這一類的二次元IP特質。 目前泡泡瑪特較難將Labubu經營成有深度人生故事的IP。 · 
至於巨星傳奇再獲市場追捧，可能是資金看中了「獨市」優勢，其「商業化閉環」模式更有利於展視明星人生故事。 周杰倫的母親葉惠美為控股股東，據報周董媽媽這一波上漲中身家一夜暴升200億台幣，商業運作同時又有「親情」在，又有誰會抗拒巨星傳奇對周杰倫人生的詮釋宣傳呢？ 而且周董很難有理由轉會，轉會即是跟自己的創作歷程的「葉惠美」割裂，在新的內容熱潮中，有如「獨佔」了周董故事，可能就是市場又重新追捧的主要原因。",SPR_COMBO[zh-tw]周杰倫與李連杰，近日雙雙因進駐抖音而成為市場關注話題。 · AFP via 周杰倫以IP「周同學」進駐抖音，市場追捧幕後推手概念股巨星傳奇（6683），股價一度單日最高盤中暴升兩倍，另邊廂武打巨星李連杰亦進駐抖音，一天粉絲增加140萬，入駐快手的兩日播放量接近8000萬，快手股價連日上漲。 然而「周同學」《抖音》至今只有3條短片，資金是否純屬炒作，抑或是追捧背後的盈利模式，以下跟大家一同探討。 下載Yahoo財經APP 美股外幣即時報價 多國新聞任睇 周杰倫以IP「周同學」進駐抖音，概念股巨星傳奇（06683）獲追捧，到底有什麼新營運模式？ 被譽為「明星IP第一股」的巨星傳奇於2023年7月13日在港交所上市，主要業務為IP創造及營運與新零售，以稀缺明星IP販賣授權，模式隨巨星上市早已出現。 巨星由周杰倫母親葉惠美、經紀人楊峻榮、前魔傑電競CEO馬心婷、周杰倫經紀公司執行高管陳中共同創立，在業內一向被稱為「周杰倫概念股」，亦有一直製作《周遊記》等戶外實境互動綜藝。 雖然一直都有IP＋新零售加持，但股價在上市後，自去年中以來一直積弱，至近日「周同學」進駐抖音，巨星股價才終於創下上市以來新高。 巨星傳奇業務總共分為IP創造及營運，與新消費兩大板塊。 前者主要內容圍繞為藝人「打造人設和內容IP」；話說在前，藝人的傳統商業價值不同於IP價值，從前再受歡迎的影視藝人，到了今天，也需要透過轉化成為IP人設，才能「變現」或「重現」其商業價值，而巨星傳奇與一般IP培育企業不同的是，巨星主要承接明星的價值轉化工作；新消費主要是IP授權販賣產品或服務，以「周同學」IP為例子，新消費（或新零售）涵蓋時尚、文創、3C、食品及貴金屬5大核心領域，據報去年聯名產品銷售額超過10億港元。 兩年前《周遊記2》在浙江衛視開播，當時市場已在熱議巨星傳奇的「生意經」 兩年前《周遊記2》在浙江衛視開播，當時市場已在熱議巨星傳奇的「生意經」，受惠的除了特約贊助的快手和最酒聯合、合作夥伴奇妙積木外，還有獨家冠名的魔胴咖啡。 魔胴咖啡是巨星傳奇旗下的中國防彈飲料市場的王牌產品，換言之冠名贊助的也是屬於旗下的品牌，當時市場形容為「商業化閉環」模式，巨星傳奇利用經營自己的IP，來帶動自己品牌的銷量。 一般而言，市場很難在巨星傳奇身上找到其他零售個股受惠的消息，因為在「閉環」之下，其他零售企業同時也是其新零售的競爭對手。 在巨星傳奇早已試水「新零售」，去年中秋「周同學愛次元空間」全國首展，「愛在西元前咖啡店」賣周杰倫限量飲品、有AI機器人的互動街區、「周同學」快閃店賣產品，「周同學」在杭州、福州、長沙等地曾經掀起過熱潮。 去年「周同學」亮相東京塔的巡迴快閃也引起過市場熱議，但為何股價到了今天才創歷數新高？ 是否在IP領域以外，市場還出現了新的內容需求？ 李連杰進軍抖音、快手以及小紅書，卻被網民質疑「老李過氣了」 另一武打巨星李連杰近日亦因進駐抖音和快手重回公眾視線引起熱話。 市場資訊瞬間萬變，李連杰進軍抖音、快手以及小紅書，但市場很快潑李連杰冷水，內地網民指他在抖音的流量不如2021年已紅進駐的劉德華，評價「老李過氣了，就幾百萬粉絲」，甚至有文章形容這次「功夫皇帝跌落神壇」。 不過細心拆解李連杰的「人設」，可了解到其盈利模式並不在於要高量流直接變現，似乎是另有所圖，更需要流量「質素」。 李連杰曾經分享回到公眾視野的三大原因，分別是「分享多年武術經驗和人生哲學」、「從小習武形成獨特人生視角」、「系統性分享武術文化和電影發展」，而他的抖音內容主要圍繞經典電影、武術產業和人生教培，並強調不參與直播帶貨。 換言之，李連杰進駐抖音的賺錢模式，很可能會延伸到平台之外的武術教學、武術類電影票房以及擁有經典武術片庫的電視台。 在另一武打巨星成龍的新電影連番失利之際，市場正需要是一位輩份並不低的武打巨星出來為武術電影及其產業指路，李連杰「人設」的價值，有待體現在相關產業之中，視乎會否有助提升「武打片」的市場價值，視乎流量變現時的「轉化率」，粉絲會否因他的內容而學習武術。 李連杰曾經分享回到公眾視野的三大原因，分別是「分享多年武術經驗和人生哲學」、「從小習武形成獨特人生視角」、「系統性分享武術文化和電影發展」 李連杰與「周同學」在平台的內容有一共通點，就是「周同學」目前有1592萬瀏覽的抖音首發視頻，跟李連杰大部分影片圍繞的主題差不多，都有人生主題，「周同學」的影片更明顯是極像近日在外國社交平台大為流行以AI生成的日本明星演藝史的成長影片，透過影片來與粉絲一同回顧人生。 在《2024抖音熱點年度數據報告》中，似乎可以看到一些端倪。 根據抖音2024年的娛樂熱門趨勢，原來短片內容開始流行一些演藝界人士的人物故事，例如自白體或「人物志」類的短片，同時需要「內容有思辨的味道」，意味影片不再停留在娛樂效果享受，而是希望開放討論演員的人生價值觀，據報抖音上有一個熱門tag便是「」，相關短片訴說舊日影星如成龍、周星馳逝去的歲月，也有在歲月中逝去的影星如張國榮、林正英、吳孟達。 資料顯示，短劇界早已懂得人生題材的價值。 短劇其中兩個長青的題材便是穿越與人生重來，這類感慨人生的內容需求，正正是近年短劇產業價值暴增的題材優勢。 短劇單劇的播放量可以高達10億，而2024年中國一共製作了超過3萬部微短劇，總收入達504億元人民幣，據報已經超過了中國電影票房收入，還未計在海外瘋狂增長的產業鏈。 恰巧上述的《抖音》熱點報告顯示，去年抖音的十大短劇Top3，亦有「重生之我在短劇裡當保姆」，反映人生故事的確受到歡迎。 「周同學」目前有1592萬瀏覽的抖音首發視頻，極像近日在外國社交平台大為流行的日本明星演藝史的成長影片，透過影片來與粉絲一同回顧人生（《抖音》「周同學」） 換言之，「周同學」進駐抖音背後的啟示，或許本來就是配合平台更大的內容趨勢，例如人生教練類的深度故事內容需求，市場正渴求一些能夠富有人生縱向發展與回顧的內容等等。 在這內容方向下，再來分析巨星進駐短片平台最可能的賺錢機會。 在抖音只發布了3條影片試水溫的周杰倫，未來會不會接下「抖音短劇」拍攝，題材穿越到一些過去他影視作品的場景（例如回到《不能說的秘密》），衍生一些以「回到過去」或打開「半島鐵盒」式的人生短劇？ 若然這類人生短劇可行，或啟示到同樣擁有明星IP的TVB，可能又多一個開拓生意的渠道。 資料顯示，現時市場並不缺乏開發IP的企業，港股「IP三傑」分別是泡泡瑪特（9992）、名創優品（9896）、布魯可（0325），三者當中似乎只有泡泡瑪特能夠做到像巨星傳奇般的「商業化閉環」，自己明星級數IP自己賣，加上其IP是二次元屬性，難以開發深度故事內容，目前市場幾乎就只有日本IP擁有這一類的二次元IP特質。 目前泡泡瑪特較難將Labubu經營成有深度人生故事的IP。 · 至於巨星傳奇再獲市場追捧，可能是資金看中了「獨市」優勢，其「商業化閉環」模式更有利於展視明星人生故事。 周杰倫的母親葉惠美為控股股東，據報周董媽媽這一波上漲中身家一夜暴升200億台幣，商業運作同時又有「親情」在，又有誰會抗拒巨星傳奇對周杰倫人生的詮釋宣傳呢？ 而且周董很難有理由轉會，轉會即是跟自己的創作歷程的「葉惠美」割裂，在新的內容熱潮中，有如「獨佔」了周董故事，可能就是市場又重新追捧的主要原因。,2025-07-20 23:30:40,zh-tw,WEB,人生啊真是匆匆,,,,1,False,False,"The provided comment is a lengthy financial article about Jay Chou's IP development and social media presence, with a brief mention of Bubble Mart (泡泡瑪特) near the end.
