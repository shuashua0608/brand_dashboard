EAF08F5EC939AAFE9B96F88DE3FB95CB,"  MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage (I charge from £1,150 for mine). Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 (£19.55, www.amazon.co.uk), Olaplex No.8 (£22.40, www.sephora.co.uk) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer (£21, www.boots.com). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner (£27, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner (£26, www.harrods.com). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now £17.99, sha op.toni www.ndguy.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now £12, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo (£24.50, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment (£25). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

397059B84031EE2F45D751CA8833E1A2,"  by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage. Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 ((EURO)29.50, www.brownthomas.com), Olaplex No.8 ((EURO)29.50, www.arnotts.ie) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer ((EURO)24.45, www.lookfantastic.ie). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner ((EURO)31, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner ((EURO)30, www.boots.ie). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now (EURO)22.49, www.cloud10beauty.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now (EURO)14, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo ((EURO)28.20, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment ((EURO)28). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

mov_96B17D9D73B31050B934DE232AF64406,"  The collective will also feature an additional 19 irrevocable talents across celebrity hairstyling and coloring, as well as a handful of educators. July 16, 2025, 8:30am Redken's network of talent is expanding across the gamut of professional hairstyling. In a new initiative named the Artistic Ambassador Program, the hair care brand, owned by the L'Oréal Group, has assembled a unique collective of 20 esteemed celebrity stylists, colorists, and educators to elevate their unparalleled expertise and knowledge within the beauty industry. “Redken has always been about inspiring and empowering stylists behind the chair. As a brand rooted in innovation and artistry with so many talented artists relying on the brand everyday, we made it our mission to leverage the most influential voices and amplify them to build community and connection,” said Guillaume Duez, Redken's general manager, via statement. “By formalizing this network of inspiring artists, we're creating a platform where artistry and brand advocacy meet to shape the future of hair from the latest trends on social to satisfying clients everyday behind the chair.” As part of the program, ambassadors will serve as representatives of the brand, all of whom are required to create digital content, work on Redken's team during award show season and lead hands-on seminars for educational purposes. On top of all that, Sarah Barr Battle, Redken's SVP and head of marketing and digital, said: “They'll collaborate with our internal teams to help develop new techniques, color trends, and product innovations while focusing on inspiring and sharing real-world expertise to fellow professionals.” As of now, the list of ambassadors includes Sabrina Carpenter and Bella Hadid's stylist Evanie Frausto, Hailey Bieber's collaborator Ryan Pearl, Johnny Ramirez, Stassi Schroeder's hair artist Bradley Leake, luxury colorist Maggie Hancock, existing Redken partner Philip Foresto and more. Most of the professionals have worked as partners of the brand for some time now; eight, however, are new. “It was easy to pick the new ambassadors because all of them have loyally used Redken color their entire careers, and vouch that Shades EQ is the most versatile, predictable and must-have haircolor that they've ever worked with,” Battle explained. “The partnerships are seamless and rooted in love for the industry, the best products to achieve the best results, and giving back to aspiring professionals.” Redken plans on adding more professionals to its network in the future. “As it evolves and we gain learnings, we will carefully expand its reach, adding more stylists to this powerful and inspirational talent pool as new tastemakers arise. Our goal is to make this a dynamic, ever-growing community that drives Redken, our stylists, our salons and most importantly the hair industry forward,” Duez said. The decision to launch this program now stemmed from the technological advancements in digital education and their impact on the salon industry as a whole. Duez explained: “Launching the program now allows us to meet these changes head-on, bringing the Redken energy and leadership through our twenty ambassadors — just as stylists and clients can rely on our product performance, they are also looking for our expertise, trust, trends and connection.” When looking at the newsmakers in professional styling, individuals who are drawing widespread attention for their statement-making work and innovative impact, Redken knew it needed Evanie Frausto for the collective. The architect's work with pop star Sabrina Carpenter, on stage and in her music videos, has captivated Gen-Z, igniting an ongoing internet-wide debate over whether her signature nest of blond coils is her own or a wig. “How can one person hold so much hair?” they ask. Search for “Sabrina Carpenter Hair” is currently up 511.8 percent year-over-year on TikTok alone, according to Spate, a company specializing in machine intelligence for the beauty industry. Carpenter became Redken's first celebrity ambassador in 2024, making Frausto's partnership ultimately inevitable. “It feels really special to me. Sabrina is not only a huge pop star, she's also someone who fully embodies transformation and self-expression, which is exactly what I love about working with hair,” he told WWD. “Being an Artistic Ambassador alongside her feels like an extension of what we already do together. We push boundaries play with identity and use hair as a way to tell a story. It makes it feel bigger than just hair and it is a testament that there are no limits to what hair can be.” Maggie Hancock was another visionary Redken felt necessary to add to the network, which was a surprise to her. “When I was even considered for this role, I was honestly blown away. It's a top five moment in my entire career. Being invited into the Redken family feels like such an honor, and saying yes was one of the easiest and most exciting decisions I've made,” she said. “I'm excited to bring my salon-friendly edginess I'm known for into the Redken community and to share the techniques and creative approaches I've developed through that work. I love being able to help other stylists feel confident pushing their creativity while keeping things on-trend.” Creator of the “Beach-kissed Lived-in Color” technique, Johnny Ramirez's appointment in the collective marks his return to Redken. For him, however, it's not about “coming back” so much as it is “deepening” an existing partnership. “Redken has always believed in elevating artists from the inside out—not just through incredible products, but through real, hands-on learning. I want to help inspire confidence behind the chair, especially when it comes to color. I've built a career on dimensional, natural-looking hair, and I'm excited to share the artistry and precision behind that work with Redken's global community,” he said.

A través de su cuenta de X (antes Twitter), contó con humor que había estado hospitalizada por una hernia causada por usar pantalones extremadamente ajustados. “'Suki, ya no tuiteas'... ¿Sabías que hace seis meses usé unos pantalones tan apretados que me causaron una hernia y tuve demasiado miedo de decírtelo?” , escribió junto a una fotografía suya desde la cama del hospital y otra sobre el escenario, donde luce los infames pantalones verdes que habrían sido los culpables. El contraste de las imágenes causó furor. Mira: Muere cantante argentina a los 36 años que padecía cáncer; ¡afirmaba curarse con la música! ¿Qué es una hernia y cómo puede causarla la ropa apretada? Aunque suene como algo que solo pasa en Hollywood, el caso de la cantante britanica Suki puso bajo los reflectores un tema poco discutido: los efectos de la ropa ajustada en la salud. Una hernia ocurre cuando parte del intestino o tejido sobresale a través de un punto débil en los músculos abdominales, y aunque no es común que la ropa apretada lo cause directamente, sí puede agravar una condición preexistente. La Clínica Mayo señala que la presión constante sobre la zona abdominal, como la ejercida por jeans ceñidos o cinturones muy ajustados, podría complicar cuadros médicos latentes o impedir una correcta presión intraabdominal. En casos extremos, como el de Suki, la estética puede terminar pasando una factura bastante alta. Lee: Muere famosa cantante de ska tras ser diagnosticada con cáncer; así confirmaron su partida: “No fue fácil” ¿Cómo reaccionaron sus fans tras la confesión viral de Suki Waterhouse, la famosa cantante? La revelación no solo sorprendió por lo peculiar del motivo, sino por la manera en que Waterhouse lo compartió. Las redes estallaron con comentarios como: “En el escenario con pantalones de cuero y luego conectada a un suero en el hospital, como una verdadera estrella de rock”. Su honestidad fue aplaudida por miles de seguidores, quienes valoraron que hablara abiertamente de un problema de salud sin caer en dramatismos. Su actitud relajada pero directa logró que se abriera un debate sobre los peligros de anteponer la moda al bienestar físico. ¿Podría afectar la hernia la carrera o gira musical de Suki Waterhouse? Hasta el momento, la famosa cantante no ha confirmado si tendrá que hacer ajustes a su calendario de presentaciones, pero todo indica que su recuperación va avanzando. En general, las hernias inguinales pueden requerir cirugía o reposo prolongado, lo que podría afectar actividades físicas intensas. Para alguien como Suki, que constantemente está en conciertos, alfombras rojas y grabaciones, esto podría significar un cambio temporal de ritmo. Sin embargo, su actitud positiva sugiere que seguirá adelante con su carrera, ahora con ropa un poco más holgada.

Featuring 75+ global brands and exciting new launches, this year's event celebrates bold, inclusive, and conscious beauty choices that reflect how we shop and express beauty today. Beauty is having a moment — one shaped by experimentation, intention, and a mix of what's new and what's true to you. From barrier-boosting skincare to bold lip colours and haircare that actually delivers, every shelf tells its own story. Kicking off on July 18, the 6th edition of Amazon's The Beauty Sale brings together buzzworthy new launches and trending picks across skincare, haircare, makeup, and fragrance, at up to 60% off, that are winning a space on all vanities, whether you are heading a dance club, a corp-core event or just simply unwinding. Shelf Talk: What's New, What's Next, What Works Beauty routines are becoming more personal, purposeful, and ingredient-aware, shaped in part by a generation that knows exactly what it wants. From skincare that supports barrier health to makeup that's expressive yet effortless, today's beauty favourites reflect a balance of trend and intention. This edition of The Beauty Sale by Amazon brings it all together — curated edits, Gen Z-loved picks, K-Beauty favourites, and the latest drops from brands like Tir Tir, Round Lab, Tree Hut, Milani, Redken, Elie Saab, and Real Techniques. And with Amazon's wide selection, great value, fast delivery, and the convenience of finding everything in one place, your beauty restock just got easier. Minimalism: Gone are the days of applying heavy layers of foundation or lipsticks and blush. This on-the-go generation is switching towards balms, glow enhancers, skin tints and lip and cheek tints from brands like Maybelline, Etude, Renee, e.l.f amongst others, for that naturally flushed minimalistic look- Less is more. Whether you are into minimalism or all about maximalism, you can get up to 20% Amazon Pay cashback on your first beauty order and an additional up to 20% off when you buy more. K-Beauty:K-Beauty aims to promote a healthy skin barrier and give a dewy and plump look, thus emphasising more on skincare. Brands like Tirtir, RoundLab, Laneige, and Skin1004 have become staples in Gen-Z's routines, offering innovative product textures and result-driven ingredients. But, wait, there's more - don't miss the Rush Hour Deals with a minimum of 30% off price drops, if you are looking for a beauty fix on a budget. Luxury and Professional Care: Haircare has evolved beyond just taming strands- it's now about scalp health, damage repair, and expressing individuality. L'Oral Professionnel, Kerastase, and O3+ give salon-level results at home, thus nourishing the hair. Not satisfied? Get a sweet 50% off on luxe essentials, so your at-home spa day is never ending. Derma-Backed Products: Brands like CeraVe and The Derma Co deliver science-backed solutions and cater to every skin type. The research-backed ingredients enhance the trust and credibility of the brand and the products, which are highly accepted by young, aware consumers. Layering Fragrances: Brands like Skinn by Titan, Bella Vita, Ellie Saab, Jaguar, offer fragrances in a plethora of notes. The trend of layering fragrances has arised due to their longevity and to be able to mix and match and customize the fragrance which defines you. Well, smelling divine just got easier with up to 60% off on fragrances.

姐妹们！！ 这支 Redken 的 Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment 是我近期用过修复效果最喜欢的一支护发神器！ 我是看Tt知道它的！ 它是一款免冲洗的护发乳～
💗 味道超好闻！！！ 很喜欢！！！ 那种淡淡的花果香🍊🌸，非常乾净高级，像刚做完头发出沙龙的味道～不刺鼻、不腻人，完全不怕跟香水打架！ 头发丝都是飘香的味道～
🧬 成分里面有：
•5% Bonding Care Complex：强化发丝内部结构，减少断裂、毛躁💪
•Citric Acid 柠檬酸：帮助平衡发丝pH值，锁色又柔顺🍋
•蛋白质补充科技（含氨基酸）：专门对抗漂染后那种“枯草感”🌾
💡【使用方式】洗完头发擦半乾后，挤在手上涂抹在发中到发尾，再吹乾就OK啦！ 我头发是经常漂染+烫卷的，真的用了几次就觉得发丝顺了、滑了、不毛躁了！ 并且会有光泽感！ ✨✨
📌 适合人群：
•有漂、染、烫过的受损发质
•发丝乾枯、断裂、难以打理
•想要leave-in但又怕黏腻的人（它完全不黏腻！！） 🛒 我是在Amazon入的，姐妹们可以看看哪里便宜哪里入手！ 🌟用完真的回不去，会想一直回购！ 😂
