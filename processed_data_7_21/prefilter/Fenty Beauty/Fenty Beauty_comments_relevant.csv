Borough Market 4.18am This is the exact time that my alarm goes off. I've calculated that gives me exactly enough time to be ready for the gym. I am woken up either by my phone alarm or my Whoop band. The first thing I do when I wake up is check my phone. It's bad, I know, but I need to check that there have been no disasters overnight that need my attention. I then brush my teeth and put on some SPF. Garnier Ambre Solaire SPF 50+ Sensitive Advanced Sun Cream Face & Body is my current go-to. My morning soundtrack is anything by Beyoncé, I love the latest album even more after seeing her live. I also take a shot of Symprove before I leave. 4.50am My gym is only a six-minute drive from my house. In summer I wear shorts and a bra top to work out in. Most of my kit comes from lululemon, Oner Active and Sweaty Betty. I work out a minimum of five times a week, mixing it up with cardio, strength training and PT sessions. When I am strength training, I wear Nike Metcons and for running, I wear Nike Journey. 6am I have my protein shake as soon as I get back from the gym. It's a mixture of protein powder, collagen and creatine with water. I then go and give my children a cuddle before heading into the shower. My favourite body wash is Naturium The Glow Getter  Body Wash  followed by the body butter. I go in quickly with a spritz of my favourite scent, Encelade by Marc-Antoine Barrois. On my face, I use Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant followed by Koba moisturiser. Make-up starts with Danessa Myricks Beauty Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder and I always use Fenty's  foundation – it's the best. I use the By Terry eye liner and I mix blushers from Merit and NARS. Finally, I set everything with Charlotte Tilbury's setting spray and in the evenings, I use the one from ONE/SIZE. 7am I'm definitely a magpie but my style is also defined by clean lines. I find Lisa Ing Marinelli's take on fashion really inspiring – she's someone who also has a corporate job but embraces her personal style. If I had an endless budget, I would go to Tove every season. I just bought one of my favourite summer dresses from the brand. I'm also a big fan of Rejina Pyo. On the high street, I love COS and Massimo Dutti. I only give myself about ten minutes to get dressed before I have to leave the house – either to get the kids to school or catch the train to work....","Breadcrumbs Life Image: . asare Life 18 July 2025 As a managing partner at OMD UK, founder of My Bump Pay, author of 'The Blend' and a passionate advocate for working parents, Tobi Asare wears many hats – often all before lunch.

mov_161D74D2CBDFD8D77F3E3AD63CBFC8B0,"  After breaking up with her billionaire fiancé, Mariah Carey reportedly sued him for a $50 million ""inconvenience fee!"" According to Forbes, there are 3,028 billionaires in the world as of 2025. While that number may have average people shouting, ""Eat the rich!"" , some celebrities see it as a potential dating pool. Here are 35 celebrities who dated or married billionaires and their heirs: 1. Camila Cabello was first romantically linked to Henry Junior Chalhoub — who's an heir to the billionaire Chalhoub family — in January 2025. The Chalhoub family founded the Chalhoub Group, a distribution company for luxury fashion. It's based in Dubai. According to Forbes, the family was worth $1.7 billion as of 2019. 2. After a few months of dating, Mariah Carey got engaged to investor James Packer in 2016. They broke up eight months later. According to Forbes, his net worth is $3.4 billion. Following their split, Mariah reportedly sued James for a $50 million ""inconvenience fee"" but settled in the neighborhood of $5–$10 million. She also got to keep her $10 million engagement ring. 3. From 2018–2022, Kaley Cuoco was married to equestrian Karl Cook, the son of Intuit founder Scott Cook. According to Forbes, Scott's net worth is $7.7 billion. In 2016, Kaley and Karl met at a horse show and bonded over their mutual love of animals. In 2021, they announced they were separating because they ""realized that [their] current paths have taken [them] in opposite directions."" 4. A$AP Rocky has been with billionaire singer and businessperson Rihanna since 2020. In 2021, Forbes reported that she achieved billionaire status largely through Fenty Beauty, the makeup brand she launched in partnership with LVMH in 2017. Another large chunk of her wealth — in the neighborhood of $270 million — comes from her stake in Savage x Fenty, the lingerie brand she started in 2018. She's reportedly worth $1 billion. 5. Before becoming a billionaire herself, Rihanna dated Hassan Jameel from 2017–2020. His family — who own the largest Toyota distribution company in several parts of the Middle East, Abdul Latif Jameel — was reportedly worth a collective $2.2 billion in 2017. 6. In 2018, Karlie Kloss married billionaire venture capitalist Josh Kushner. He founded the firm Thrive Capital in 2009 and has invested in companies like Instagram, Instacart, Zola, and Robinhood. Per Forbes, he's worth $3.8 billion. 7. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has been dating billionaire singer Taylor Swift since 2023. According to Forbes, Taylor was the first musician to achieve billionaire status predominantly through her music and performances. She was added to the list in October 2023, largely because of her music catalog and the Eras Tour. Her net worth is $1.6 billion. 8. In 2019, YouTube star Gigi Gorgeous married model/designer Nats Getty, who's the great-grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. Forbes clocked the Getty family's net worth at $5.4 billion in 2015. They met at Paris Fashion Week 2016 when they closed the show put on by August Getty, Nats's brother and Gigi's best friend. However, they filed for divorce in 2025. 9. Brooklyn Peltz Beckham married actor/heiress Nicola Peltz Beckham in 2022. They first met at Coachella in 2017 when one of her brothers introduced them. However, they were both in relationships at the time, but despite not really getting along, they kept in touch.
