0D107D4C3FB0303292D90C5F77497441,"  Are two-piece matching sets still trendy? I wanted to find one for a casual summer event, but then I wondered if that look had passed its prime. Yael, The Bronx   The coordinated ''set,'' known more colloquially as the co-ord set, that perfectly matching combination of top and bottom, has been part of the standard wardrobe for decades. What, after all, is a suit but a set with different vowels? It has, however, taken many forms over the years and has ebbed and flowed in the public consciousness. The last time sets really became a thing was in the fall of 2021, after the Miu Miu show during Paris Fashion Week. That's when Miuccia Prada showed matching khaki or gray pleated micro-miniskirts and cropped jacket tops or cable knits. Before you could say ''social media catnip,'' the Miu Miu set had gone stratospheric, worn by Nicole Kidman on the cover of Vanity Fair as well as influencers by the truckload. It was not, however, the first set, and it certainly won't be the last. The Juicy Couture tracksuit, beloved by Los Angeles denizens and celebrities everywhere in the early aughts, was a set. The fact that the aughts are currently enjoying a style renaissance, along with the whole set concept, is probably not a coincidence. Before that, Cher Horowitz's yellow plaid suit in ''Clueless'' was a set. In the 1920s, Coco Chanel loved a knit set, a coordinated cardigan and skirt inspired by clothing worn to play tennis and golf. Some historians trace the origins of the set back even further, to the 16th and 17th centuries, when men started wearing matching doublets and hose. As to why the set concept lasted so long, it's pretty simple. As the stylist Gabriella Karefa-Johnson told me when I asked, ''it makes life easier.'' You don't have to worry about coordinating your clothes because they are already coordinated. It makes you look pulled together with pretty much zero effort. And it makes packing simpler because you can wear the top and bottom together or apart. One drawback to the concept, Ms. Karefa-Johnson said, is that it can become a crutch of sorts, a way of ceding responsibility in the morning that can atrophy the taste muscle. And since dressing is in part about showing others who you are as an individual, it can act more like camouflage than self-expression. Samira Nasr, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, said she tended to stay away from sets because she preferred looking ''as though something is a little off'' and giving her clothes an idiosyncrasy that is uniquely hers. And judging by recent debuts of new designers at big brands, like Michael Rider at Celine, with its mismatched classics, that kind of idiosyncrasy may be on the rise. But here's the thing about sets: You can always disaggregate the pieces and turn them into separates -- you can always mix and unmatch them -- and then re-aggregate according to taste. In that light, investing in a set is not being trendy. It's being smart.Every week in the Open Thread newsletter, The Times's chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, answers a reader's fashion-related question.

mov_3CC5DC67AA7C888806FF8E692E14451E,"  Exploring the art form of museum-based performance, Chanel has unveiled “Theater,” the third season of the Next Cultural Producer program, established in collaboration with Power Station of Art, the Shanghai-based contemporary art museum and one of Asia's largest. This year's winning proposal, tiitled “Noon, Wildness, Stream, Washe, Ruins, Theatre,” was curated by the Hangzhou-based artist group Martin Goya Business and opened on July 12 with an unconventional performance that brought together 150 art activists and lasted for eight hours. The exhibition, split into several sections, juxtaposes ancient Chinese architectural forms — such as a Song Dynasty entertainment venue and latticed paper windows — with a symphony of moving images, poetry, crowd-sourced documents from its artist community, and graffiti-like paintings. Together, the exhibition disrupts the museum's white cube setting and sets the scene for its anachronistic storyline. On opening night, members of the local artist community — including students, deejays, dancers, emerging talents, and established names — came together for a dynamic performance, or “continuous collective action,” that culminated in a midnight mini-concert by avant-garde rock band Mola Oddity, fronted by former Taiwanese pop star Amber Kuo. “The eight-hour duration [performance] is meant to transcend time by exploring different modes of viewing, including how we perceive things in ancient times versus now,” said Cheng Ran, co-founder of Martin Goya Business, during a panel discussion on Sunday. “It creates small transformations and frees people from the comfort of familiarity, guiding them towards a more spiritual or contemplative one. You can't explain the space in a fixed framework; perhaps this is our way of grasping small freedoms,” Cheng added. Cheng also emphasized that the art institution should “bear witness to emerging artistic careers, rather than serving as the last stamp of approval,” he added. The four-person artist group, established in Hangzhou eight years ago, is led by Cheng, co-founder Da Mian, a Chinese martial arts fantasy novelist; Taoph, a visual and music curator; and Tan Sin Thiau, a writer. More in Entertainment The group, named after one of the 24 cats owned by the group, exists as an outlier from the traditional art system and aims to support, promote, and engage within the local Hangzhou artist ecosystem. It has curated more than 100 events, collaborated with some 400 trans-disciplinary creators, and held exhibitions across 20 countries. Its latest invention involves a canteen-style restaurant, which turns into a bar operated by artists at night. “The artist community needs to find a sustainable way to build up a community. We have to eat, we can't exist in a vacuum,” explained Da Mian. Triggered by Hangzhou's rapid urbanization, the group had to relocate four times until it found its current studio in the outskirts of the Shanghai-adjacent city. That experience informed a two-story-tall scaffolding structure where 12 artists took turns live-painting, the latter's work overlaying its predecessor's. “Most art exhibitions focus on showcasing the finished painting, but I wanted to present a scene very familiar to painters, the ruins, or the remnants they encounter during the process of relocating their studio. I believe many artists face the same dilemma. Where do you rent a studio and how long can you keep it? In Hangzhou, we are constantly exploring the city's boundaries as it expands. Each time the city grows, we inevitably face relocation, sometimes even collective relocation,” said Da. “When we are confronted by the complex task of moving, which often involves packing up several years of personal work, we have the urge to claim the space our own again. Oftentimes, artists come together, armed with flashlights, sneak inside to make music, to perform, or paint,” added Da. In the next three months, 1,500 gigabytes of performance footage captured by ten cameras during opening night will be edited down and displayed at the exhibition. “We had a loose script for the exhibition, but we left it largely open, so the video has to portray the collective creative process; its visual representation needs to be constantly evolving,” explained Da. The free exhibition is open to the public until Sept. 8. Co-founded by PSA and the Chanel Culture Fund in 2021, the Next Cultural Producer initiative marks the company's first partnership with a museum in Asia. The program's previous two seasons shed light on Chinese craft and architecture in Southern China. Last May, Chanel signed a strategic partnership with PSA to restore the museum and enrich its collection and research capacity. PSA is the first state-run contemporary art museum in mainland China. Located in a former power plant along the Huangpu River, the museum spans more than 441,000 square feet and opened in 2012.","Exploring the art form of museum-based performance, Chanel has unveiled “Theater,” the third season of the Next Cultural Producer program, established in collaboration with Power Station of Art, the Shanghai-based contemporary art museum and one of Asia's largest.

mov_030B1BA4A2C133EEA998699DCB371049,"  SPR_COMBO[id]Suara.com - Hubungan asmara El Rumi dan Syifa Hadju kembali mencuri perhatian publik. Kali ini, putra Maia Estianty itu menunjukkan sisi romantisnya dengan memberikan kejutan istimewa untuk ulang tahun sang kekasih, yang genap berusia 25 tahun pada Minggu (13/7/2025) kemarin. Tak hanya mengunggah foto-foto mesra mereka berdua di Instagram, El Rumi juga menuliskan pesan manis untuk Syifa Hadju yang membuat warganet ikut terbawa suasana. ""Selamat ulang tahun untuk cinta dalam kehidupanku, @syifahadju,"" tulis El dalam caption unggahannya, yang dikutip Suara.com pada Senin (14/7/2025). Dalam pesan lanjutannya, adik Al Ghazali itu menyampaikan doa tulus agar Syifa Hadju selalu dikelilingi kebahagiaan. Ia pun mengungkap rasa syukurnya karena masih bisa menjalani hari-hari bersama wanita yang ia sayangi. Syifa Hadju, bagi El Rumi adalah sosok yang menurutnya membuat cinta terasa “aman, sejati, dan menyenangkan sekaligus.” ""Kamu adalah cinta dalam bentuk yang paling... dan aku berterima kasih kepada alam semesta setiap hari untukmu. Ini untuk merayakan hari ini dan selalu. Sekali lagi, selamat ulang tahun, Bebe,"" tulis El Rumi, penuh cinta. Namun yang paling menyita perhatian publik adalah kejutan spesial dari El Rumi di hari ulang tahun Syifa Hadju. Dalam unggahan Instagram Story, tampak pria 26 tahun tersebut datang membawa kue ulang tahun dan sebuket bunga. Tapi itu belum selesai. Momen saat Syifa Hadju membuka hadiah dari El Rumi juga terekam dan dibagikan oleh para sahabat mereka. Tak main-main putra musisi Ahmad Dhani tersebut menghadiahkan sebuah tas mewah Chanel 25 Small Handbag Grained Calfskin Gild Tone Metal Gold White, yang diketahui bernilai fantastis: Rp106.700.000! Momen ini pun langsung jadi bahan perbincangan netizen, khususnya di akun Instagram @outfit.syifahadju.

Alden Allen and Elise Lacret* Bebe Buell turns 72 today, and the rock & roll grand dame has never been more vital. Or more appreciative of her time on this planet. Last summer, the singer, songwriter, and model was diagnosed with breast cancer after a routine mammogram. She had a lumpectomy, and then a breast reduction, before embarking on a holistic journey to regain her health. Buell succeeded and is presently showing no signs of cancer seven months after her surgery. On Monday, she celebrates her resilience, while taking stock of the temporary nature of life, with the release of her new song and video “Skin Suit.” Buell delivers the gothic rock ballad, which she co-wrote with producer Greg Lattimer and her husband and creative partner, Jim Wallerstein, with gravitas, grace, and good ol' fashioned theatricality. While her “skin suit” may be her very flesh and blood, she considers it no more important than the haute couture in her closet. “This is just my skin suit/Hanging next to my Manuel,” she sings, cheekily name-checking the Nashville tailor famous for his rhinestoned creations. In the next line, Buell says she stores her “skin suit” next to “my Coco Chanel.” “The 'skin suit' is the physical body. It's not our soul. It's what we use to be on this earth,” Buell tells Rolling Stone. “I had the title and I had the chorus in my head whirling around. And then after I got my diagnosis, it was almost like something channeled. I put my pen to a piece of paper and it literally just poured out of me exactly as I sing it.” Despite its connection to her cancer battle, Buell is reluctant to describe “Skin Suit” as a survivor story. “It's a warrior story, because I am a warrior that is not going to be killed in battle,” she says. “I'm being very Joan of Arc about this.” In the video, directed by Alden Allen and Elise Lacret, Buell — in her Manuel pants and jacket — performs the song in front of an unfolding galaxy of stars. Long after she was famously photographed in the Seventies in a Creem T-shirt and little else, she embraces her decades. “I'm trying to age gracefully and show people that you can be very alive and very on the road to healing at all ages. And music is healing,” she says. Trending Stories Documents Show FEMA Calls Went Unanswered.

We were just so annoyed. How could they do it? But the response is absolutely incredible.” She added: “When we calculated, it was about £800. These are handmade products, which is why they are so expensive. They are premium but they cannot be resold elsewhere. It's not like a Chanel handbag.” Blue Almonds had written online: “Please share this footage [...] it could help identify the individuals involved and increase the chances of them being caught. “We were unfortunate to experience theft at our boutique, something that thankfully doesn't happen often, but it's still upsetting. “As a public service, we're sharing this footage to raise awareness and help warn other businesses in the area to stay extra cautious. “If you recognise anyone in the footage, you can contact the police and give them this crime reference number 01/7719971/25 or contact us via Instagram, Facebook, or email. We will forward all information to the police.” A spokesman said: “Police are appealing for further information following a report of an alleged theft from a shop in Walton Street, Kensington which was reported at 9.02pm on Thursday, July 10. “No arrests have been made at this stage.”","A man and woman are accused of stealing handmade baby clothes worth £800 from a boutique adored by the . footage shared on social media by Blue Almonds on Walton Street appears to show the pair walking out without paying.

Email tips@dailymail.com Kylie Jenner brazenly copied one of her Hollywood idols - Jennifer Lopez - while on a luxury vacation on a yacht in Greece last week. The 27-year-old reality TV star added something to her look that she usually doesn't have on. The Kylie Cosmetics founder wore a gold anklet on her one of her ankles, a thing Lopez has been doing for decades. And Jenner also added large hoop earrings in gold, which is one of JLo's signature moves. Lopez is a longtime friend of the Kardashian family as she is pals with Kim and Khloe. And she has also attended Kris Jenner's Christmas Eve party in Hidden Hills, California. The girlfriend of Timothee Chalamet had on a sleeveless ivory gown with a slit up the front and added strappy black heels. She was heading out to dinner on shore with her best pal, Stassie Karanikolaou, aka as Stassie Baby. Kylie did not mention Lopez in her caption but instead kept her wording extremely brief.  ' Greeeece,' the mom of two captioned her update. Most of the pinup shots were of Kylie in bikinis. In the first image, The Kardashians star wore a tiny yellow and black Chanel string bikini as she sat on her knees on the yacht. Kylie tipped her head to one side in the shot and looked like she was rolling her eyes. In another snap, the reality TV star showered off as she climbed back onto the boat after a swim in the sea. In another photo, Kylie poured herself into a tiny leopard print bikini that highlighted her toned figure. Kylie turned up the heat with a photo of herself leaning against the railing of the yacht in a skin tight, curve hugging white dress. Other photos in the group included a shot of five women's feet in flip flops, a photo of her pink Chanel tote bag and a bunch of nature shots. Khloé Kardashian commented on her sister's post: 'Are you ever coming home?' A fan also mentioned seeing her on the yacht, writing, 'We saw your yacht in paxos!!! We drove past on a boat. hope ur having the best time.' A bunch of other fans commented along the lines of 'Oh girl your life is so fun' and 'what a life.' And many others complimented her beauty with comments such as 'How is someone this perfect' and 'sun-kissed beauty ❤️.' Kylie's trip to Greece comes after she introduced her collaboration with Frankie's Bikinis. The new swimwear collaboration is called Cloud Cups by Frankies Bikinis x KHY. 'I've always loved Frankies Bikinis, and I'm so excited to partner with them to create this collection – with incredibly flattering silhouettes in super soft material, these are the perfect pieces for summer,' Kylie told DailyMail.com in a statement. 'We've incorporated so many fun prints – from polka dots to leopard – and the styles are so comfortable, it feels like they float on your skin while lifting and sculpting. 'One of my favorite pieces is the Heavenly Satin top – the lace detail is so sweet, and it showcases the vintage aesthetic that this collection is all about.' 'Designing this collection with Kylie felt so natural, like two girls dreaming up their perfect swim drawer,' said Aiello, founder of Frankies Bikinis. 'We wanted each piece to lift, shape, and sculpt while wrapping the body in delicate support.' With six bikini top styles, bottoms that range from classic strings to fuller-coverage, and sun dresses and separates, Frankies Bikinis x KHY offers styles for every aesthetic. Beyond swim, Frankies Bikinis x KHY expands into limited edition mini dresses and easy separates. 'KHY aims to redefine the modern wardrobe by offering edited collections that seamlessly blends luxury with everyday style, spanning a diverse range of categories and styles. 'By collaborating with iconic brands and global designers, we hope that KHY will be a platform that delivers access to incredible fashion for everyone,' the company said in a statement. Frankies Bikinis is a female-led lifestyle brand recognized for its on-trend designs, innovative fabrics, and a commitment to crafting styles that make women feel more confident. Founded by mother-daughter duo Mimi and Francesca Aiello in their Malibu home in 2012, the brand has since grown into an internationally recognized company.","Have YOU got a story?

À Paris, qui clôturait comme d'habitude le bal et accueillait une horde de mannequins, acheteurs et journalistes en provenance directe de Milan, le Covid-19 s'est invité dans nombre de conversations mêlant inquiétude et incertitude ou, au contraire, insouciance voire optimisme. Frappée de plein fouet par l'épidémie, qui risque de peser lourd sur les chiffres d'affaires des entreprises, l'industrie de la mode a cependant plutôt démontré que le « show must go on ». De la réflexion sur le spectacle qu'est la mode de Gucci au premier défilé parisien de Kenneth Ize en passant par le lancement de la nouvelle ligne « Recicla » chez Margiela, les castings inclusifs de Chanel et Valentino ou encore les premiers pas de Felipe Oliveira Baptista chez Kenzo, voici les moments qu'il fallait retenir des Fashion Weeks automne-hiver 2020-2021 de New-York, Londres, Milan et Paris. [/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height= »30px »][vc_column_text el_class= »intertitre »]La conquête de l'Ouest de Tom Ford [/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height= »30px »][vc_column_text] Organisée du 7 au 12 février dernier, la Fashion Week de New York ouvrait comme toujours le bal du Fashion Month. Mais saison après saison, la ville semble être toujours plus à bout de souffle. Et pour cause : alors que certaines des plus grandes têtes d'affiches et quelques-uns des jeunes créateurs phares de la semaine de la mode new yorkaise (Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Alexander Wang, Jeremy Scott, Pyer Moss ou encore Telfar Clemens) décidaient de délocaliser leur défilé à Londres ou Paris, ou passaient tout simplement leur tour cette saison, Tom Ford assénait un dernier coup de massue à New York en partant présenter sa collection à Los Angeles. Prise par celui qui est pourtant président du CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America), cette décision motivée par l'organisation deux jours plus tard des Oscars a suscité quelques vives critiques. Elle a cependant permis au créateur, qui faisait un clin d'œil au Los Angeles des années 70 à travers sa collection, de bénéficier de l'attractivité de la cérémonie.

À Paris, qui clôturait comme d'habitude le bal et accueillait une horde de mannequins, acheteurs et journalistes en provenance directe de Milan, le Covid-19 s'est invité dans nombre de conversations mêlant inquiétude et incertitude ou, au contraire, insouciance voire optimisme. Frappée de plein fouet par l'épidémie, qui risque de peser lourd sur les chiffres d'affaires des entreprises, l'industrie de la mode a cependant plutôt démontré que le « show must go on ». De la réflexion sur le spectacle qu'est la mode de Gucci au premier défilé parisien de Kenneth Ize en passant par le lancement de la nouvelle ligne « Recicla » chez Margiela, les castings inclusifs de Chanel et Valentino ou encore les premiers pas de Felipe Oliveira Baptista chez Kenzo, voici les moments qu'il fallait retenir des Fashion Weeks automne-hiver 2020-2021 de New-York, Londres, Milan et Paris. [/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height= »30px »][vc_column_text el_class= »intertitre »]La conquête de l'Ouest de Tom Ford [/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space height= »30px »][vc_column_text] Organisée du 7 au 12 février dernier, la Fashion Week de New York ouvrait comme toujours le bal du Fashion Month. Mais saison après saison, la ville semble être toujours plus à bout de souffle. Et pour cause : alors que certaines des plus grandes têtes d'affiches et quelques-uns des jeunes créateurs phares de la semaine de la mode new yorkaise (Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Alexander Wang, Jeremy Scott, Pyer Moss ou encore Telfar Clemens) décidaient de délocaliser leur défilé à Londres ou Paris, ou passaient tout simplement leur tour cette saison, Tom Ford assénait un dernier coup de massue à New York en partant présenter sa collection à Los Angeles. Prise par celui qui est pourtant président du CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America), cette décision motivée par l'organisation deux jours plus tard des Oscars a suscité quelques vives critiques. Elle a cependant permis au créateur, qui faisait un clin d'œil au Los Angeles des années 70 à travers sa collection, de bénéficier de l'attractivité de la cérémonie. En témoigne l'armada de célébrités assises au premier rang : Jennifer Lopez, Miley Cyrus, Lil Nas X, Renée Zellweger, Tracee Ellis Ross, Demi Moore, Jason Momoa, Kate Hudson ou encore Jeff Bezos, PDG d'Amazon. Côté casting, Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid et Gigi Hadid défilaient devant la papesse de la mode américaine Anna Wintour, qui avait également fait le déplacement avant de regagner la côte est, de plus en plus délaissée.

mov_B46E1ED64F1E7438124E51AB06608491,"  NEED TO KNOW Rihanna and her kids dressed to impress in designer outfits for the Smurfs premiere in Los Angeles on July 13 The singer, who is expecting her third baby with A$AP Rocky, wore Saint Laurent while her sons, Riot and RZA, wore bespoke Dior Since announcing her pregnancy at the 2025 Met Gala, Rihanna has been taking on a new category of maternity red carpet style Fashion runs deep in Rihanna's household. On Sunday, July 13, the singer brought her two sons, RZA, 3 and Riot, 23 months, for a special night out at the Smurfs premiere in Los Angeles. While the evening was a celebration of Rihanna's new acting gig — she voices Smurfette in the animated film — it also turned into a runway show once the trio stepped onto the carpet. The 37-year-old Fenty Beauty founder, who is expecting her third child with A$AP Rocky, made a statement in a bump-baring Saint Laurent Fall 2025 gown with lace cups, a full skirt and an olive green ribbon cinching her waist. She teamed it with a leather moto jacket and pink glam topped with a high bun.

The performer wasn't the only one stunting fresh-off-the-runway styles though. Turns out, her little ones were also dressed to the nines in miniature menswear looks drawn directly from Jonathan Anderson's first collection for Dior Homme, which debuted on June 27 during Paris Men's Fashion Week. Riot wore a custom toddler's version of one of Anderson's ensembles that featured a green single-breasted jacket, a white shirt with a matching bow tie and flared white shorts. Although, the model's fisherman sandals were traded out for adorable oxford shoes. RZA's outfit — which comprised of a pink button-up shirt and tie and dark green cargo pants — appeared to be an interpretation of one of the Dior runway designs. Arnold Jerocki/Getty Rihanna and A$AP Rocky at the ""Smurfs"" global premiere in Brussels on June 28, 2025 The family cuteness didn't stop at the three's coordinating looks. They shared many sweet moments during the event, including when RZA and Riot had a chance to meet Papa Smurf. During the interaction, the toddlers beamed with excitement as they were introduced to the famous Smurf character. Since announcing the news of her growing family at the 2025 Met Gala, Rihanna has not stopped showing up and showing out across the globe. She first kicked off the press tour for Smurfs in late June at the movie's global premiere in Brussels. She stepped out alongside Rocky, 36, who she was confirmed to be dating in 2020.

On Sunday, July 13, the singer brought her two sons, RZA, 3 and Riot, 23 months, for a special night out at the Smurfs premiere in Los Angeles. While the evening was a celebration of Rihanna's new acting gig — she voices Smurfette in the animated film — it also turned into a runway show once the trio stepped onto the carpet. The 37-year-old Fenty Beauty founder, who is expecting her third child with A$AP Rocky, made a statement in a bump-baring Saint Laurent Fall 2025 gown with lace cups, a full skirt and an olive green ribbon cinching her waist. She teamed it with a leather moto jacket and pink glam topped with a high bun.

The performer wasn't the only one stunting fresh-off-the-runway styles though. Turns out, her little ones were also dressed to the nines in miniature menswear looks drawn directly from Jonathan Anderson's first collection for Dior Homme, which debuted on June 27 during Paris Men's Fashion Week. Riot wore a custom toddler's version of one of Anderson's ensembles that featured a green single-breasted jacket, a white shirt with a matching bow tie and flared white shorts. Although, the model's fisherman sandals were traded out for adorable oxford shoes. RZA's outfit — which comprised of a pink button-up shirt and tie and dark green cargo pants — appeared to be an interpretation of one of the Dior runway designs. Arnold Jerocki/Getty Rihanna and A$AP Rocky at the ""Smurfs"" global premiere in Brussels on June 28, 2025 The family cuteness didn't stop at the three's coordinating looks. They shared many sweet moments during the event, including when RZA and Riot had a chance to meet Papa Smurf. During the interaction, the toddlers beamed with excitement as they were introduced to the famous Smurf character. Since announcing the news of her growing family at the 2025 Met Gala, Rihanna has not stopped showing up and showing out across the globe. She first kicked off the press tour for Smurfs in late June at the movie's global premiere in Brussels. She stepped out alongside Rocky, 36, who she was confirmed to be dating in 2020.

The Fenty founder, 37, stepped out wearing a hooded tank top and a glittery maxi skirt for dinner at Giorgio Baldi following the Los Angeles premiere of Smurfs on Sunday, July 13. The white two-piece look, showcasing her growing baby bump, is one of the latest standout moments in her pregnancy style repertoire. Rihanna put a fresh spin on a beloved silhouette — a crop top and low-rise bottom — with the white set by Alaïa's Pieter Mulier, per Vogue. The top's hood draped down into a high neckline, but left room for the singer's bold diamond earrings to peek through. The floor-length skirt featured a sculptural roll of padding around the waistband, creating a flared look at her hips. Rihanna completed the look with black rectangular shades and a stack of diamond bracelets. BACKGRID Rihanna on July 13. The white look was her second of the night: earlier at the Smurfs premiere, Rihanna donned another drop-waist silhouette, this time in a deep-brown shade. The singer, who voices ""Smurfette"" in the upcoming animated film, arrived in a mermaid dress from Saint Laurent's Fall 2025 collection: a delicate lace bodice and a voluminous full skirt, with an olive green ribbon sitting at the waist. She paired the dress with an oversized leather jacket of similar hue, and piled her hair into a high updo. Her two sons, Riot, 1 ½, and RZA, 3, joined her for the premiere — and also showed up in designer looks. Both boys sported looks from Jonathan Anderson's debut collection for Dior Homme, which recently unveiled during Paris Men's Fashion Week on June 27.

mov_7FF3B66C777EBAE5656F10EF1591252E,"  Findings from YipitData show that TikTok Shop and Target are neck-and-neck by fragrance sales; Kayali is number one at Sephora, and more. July 15, 2025, 1:05am Macy's may be holding on to its longtime position as the top U.S. retailer by share of fragrance sales, but plenty of other shifts are afoot when it comes to who's winning the category. According to YipitData, Macy's accounted for 31.8 percent of fragrance sales during the month of May, indicating a 14.7-point lead from the category's next-biggest retailer during the period, Ulta Beauty. While significant, that lead is several points less than it was, say, two years prior in 2023, when Macy's accounted for more than 40 percent of fragrance sales during the same month. This shift is in part due to the nascent growth of alternative fragrance retailers as formidable competitors in the space. There's Amazon, which, per YipitData, accounted for 14.9 percent of fragrance sales in May across the platform's first- and third-party sellers (tracking after Sephora, which accounted for 15.5 percent during the same period). TikTok Shop, too, wasn't on the map at all in the U.S. until halfway through 2023, yet today the e-tailer — which has propelled brands from Lattafa to Phlur to virality — goes head-to-head with Target in terms of share of fragrance sales, actually outpacing Target slightly in May. Year-to-date, the top three fragrance brands at Sephora have been Kayali, Sol de Janeiro and YSL Beauty, in that order. For the month of May, Valentino overtook YSL for the number-three spot, while in April, Chanel's Chance Eau Splendide Eau de Parfum was the retailer's top-selling new stock keeping unit across the store. On Amazon, which YipitData reports has gained modest but steady share in fragrance since 2023, winning brands range from value-driven to designer, a dynamic which the platform's top two brands in May — Lattafa and Versace — quintessentially represent. Other top 10 brands on Amazon include Sol de Janeiro, Nautica and Dior (which, like all brands owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, does not officially sell on the platform). So far in 2025, fragrance has been the fastest-growing category in beauty, as has been the case since 2021. According to Circana, the category grew 4 percent in the prestige market and 8 percent in mass during the first quarter of this year. The top 10 retailers by share of fragrance sales in May 2025, per YipitData. 1. Macy's 31.8 percent 2. Ulta Beauty 17.1 percent 3. Sephora 15.5 percent 4.

Year-to-date, the top three fragrance brands at Sephora have been Kayali, Sol de Janeiro and YSL Beauty, in that order. For the month of May, Valentino overtook YSL for the number-three spot, while in April, Chanel's Chance Eau Splendide Eau de Parfum was the retailer's top-selling new stock keeping unit across the store. On Amazon, which YipitData reports has gained modest but steady share in fragrance since 2023, winning brands range from value-driven to designer, a dynamic which the platform's top two brands in May — Lattafa and Versace — quintessentially represent. Other top 10 brands on Amazon include Sol de Janeiro, Nautica and Dior (which, like all brands owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, does not officially sell on the platform). So far in 2025, fragrance has been the fastest-growing category in beauty, as has been the case since 2021. According to Circana, the category grew 4 percent in the prestige market and 8 percent in mass during the first quarter of this year. The top 10 retailers by share of fragrance sales in May 2025, per YipitData. 1. Macy's 31.8 percent 2. Ulta Beauty 17.1 percent 3. Sephora 15.5 percent 4.

This timeless tote emerged as one of the defining accessories of the 2011s, seamlessly blending elegance with everyday practicality. The Phantom quickly transcended mere trendiness, becoming a symbol of Philo's understated yet luxurious vision. The recent show at Celine's Paris headquarters was nothing short of spectacular. Guests were seated in a formation that creatively echoed the Celine Triomphe logo. It was also a momentous occasion, marking Anna Wintour's first attendance at a Celine show in six years—a significant comeback after the tension with former creative director Hedi Slimane, who had blacklisted Vogue, effectively stalling coverage and advertising within Condé Nast. Esteemed peers like Raf Simons and Jonathan Anderson were also in the audience, showing their support for their fellow creativity. Jane Birkin's Iconic Original Hermès Bag Soared to an Astonishing $10 Million! Now, we're witnessing the triumphant return of the Celine Phantom—a bag that debuted in 2011 under Phoebe Philo's genius and quickly won the hearts of fashion lovers everywhere. With its impressive winged silhouette, minimal branding, and spacious interior, the Phantom effortlessly married style with functionality. No wonder it became a coveted collector's item, often spotted on celebrities and fashion insiders, flying off the shelves and solidifying its status as a modern icon. Chanel Fall 2025 Couture: A Quiet Prelude Before the Storm. The Phantom is making a sensational comeback! Fashion enthusiasts are dusting off their vintage models and giving them a fresh clean to flaunt in style. Micheal Rider has ingeniously reimagined this cult classic, breathing new life into Philo's beloved design from 2011. The latest iteration, affectionately nicknamed the “smile bag” for its playful front zipper, cleverly embraces this charm by transforming the zip detail into a whimsical smile shape. This rebirth not only pays tribute to Philo's legacy but also nods to the sleek aesthetics of contemporary minimalism. While the new design hasn't hit the market just yet, savvy trendsetters will want to dig deep into their wardrobes to resurface their original Phantoms and stay one step ahead of the game. So, are you ready for the sensational return of the Celine Phantom? The revival many of us have been waiting for is finally here!

mov_0F8288AF380BBD7E041ACAD157CF4240,"  Coca Cola, one of the most iconic brands in the world, is recognised instantly by its distinctive red packaging and flowing white script. As the beverage giant introduced different versions of its classic drink - such as Diet Coke and Coke Zero alongside limited editions and new flavours - the company has skilfully adapted the emblematic logo for each product, while maintaining the brand's retro charm. Brands all over the globe strive for this sort of instant recognisability, with a huge part of a company's success coming down to the power and recognisability of its logo. Richard Lau, president of LOGO.com and an expert in logo design and marketing strategy, said: ""Businesses cannot overlook the value a great logo holds; they are the connection between a company and potential customers, and what customers will remember most."" Though the Coca Cola logo may just seem like a fancy version of the brand name, the extended tail on the 'C' is thought to represent a smile, echoing the brand's aim of creating happiness and joy. Richard further explained: ""This subtle message may go unnoticed, but it subconsciously creates a positive association with the brand in the minds of consumers."" The company is quite open about its history, including the story behind the creation of the logo, offering a deep dive into its development over time on its official website. The iconic recipe was crafted to perfection by Dr John S Pemberton in May 1886, who was a pharmacist from Atlanta, Georgia, and he concocted the original syrup for the drink. Coca Cola's creation then occurred when carbonated water was mixed with the crafted syrup, resulting in a beverage that was later dubbed ""delicious and refreshing"". According to the Coca Cola website, Dr Pemberton transported a jug of his new concoction to Jacobs' Pharmacy in Atlanta, where it received commendation for being ""excellent"" and was sold as a soda fountain drink at five cents per glass. It was Dr Pemberton's bookkeeper Frank M Robinson who suggested the name ""Coca Cola"" and who crafted the flowing script still recognised today. Robinson held the view that ""the two Cs would look well in advertising"", a notion that also rang true for Coco Chanel and her eponymous fashion brand founded in 1910. Robinson dabbled with various iterations of the Coca Cola logo in Spencerian script which was fashionable in writing during that period. The evolution of logo designs continued until there were numerous versions by the late 1960s. In 1969, Coca Cola unveiled the Arden Square logo - encapsulated within a red box with [Robinson's] signature script of Coca Cola underscored by the white 'wave', referred to as the 'Dynamic Ribbon Device'. This symbol has persistently represented the brand worldwide since then. Reddit users recently revived the conversation about Coca Cola's ageless design. One user expressed high praise for Coca Cola's classic aesthetic. Another individual remarked: ""Also cool to see how it translates across different languages."" Another person commented: ""Ever since someone told me about the faces in the logo I can't unsee it whenever I look at it."" A third individual enthused: ""Perfect logo."" A fourth added: ""Coca Cola is a cool logo that's why they didn't change it.""","Coca Cola, one of the most iconic brands in the world, is recognised instantly by its distinctive red packaging and flowing white script.

mov_1657B39EB1BF61BFF8B049E272B441E0,"  Created by Valentina Li in collaboration with the Chanel Makeup Creation Studio, the Les Beiges – Golden Hour Collection transforms transient beauty into an everyday ritual of radiance. Drawing inspiration from the ever-changing hues of the sky at sunrise and sunset, the collection offers a warm, summery colour story designed to reflect — and refract — the golden hour ' s softest light. Radiant pinks, muted corals and glowing copper tones mirror the sun ' s daily dance across the skyline, capturing the mood of the moment in formulas that are both luminous and wearable. Complexion: At the heart of the collection lies the Les Beiges Healthy Golden Glow Powder, a duo of finely-milled powders embossed with a sunset motif. Available in Éclat du Soir (a satin pink and shimmery rose gold) and Soleil Couchant (a soft orange paired with coppery bronze), each pairing enhances the complexion with a light-infused glow. The texture is imperceptibly fine, blending seamlessly into the skin to leave it glowing, as if kissed by the last light of day. Complementing this is the Les Beiges Healthy Glow Sheer Colour Stick, returning in two new radiant shades: Reset, a golden orange shimmer, and Refresh, a luminous satin pink. Swiped across cheeks or layered for intensity, these blush sticks melt into the skin for a dewy, sunkissed flush. Eyes: For the eyes, Chanel reinterprets its iconic Les Beiges Healthy Glow Natural Eyeshadow Palette in a new harmony, Golden — a flurry of hues echoing the changing tones of the sky. From rose gold and luminous copper to matte mauve and rosewood, each shade is designed to softly sculpt and highlight, whether for a wash of daytime elegance or a deeper dusk-time drama. Lips: Completing the collection is a quartet of new shades of Rouge Coco Flash, infusing lips with a touch of colour and a veil of light. Sun Bliss offers a golden pinkish beige, Sunset a rich pink sienna, and Sun Kiss a luminous cool pink — each designed to add a veil of warm-toned polish to every golden hour look. chanel.com The post appeared first on A&E Magazine .","Created by Valentina Li in collaboration with the Chanel Makeup Creation Studio, the Les Beiges – Golden Hour Collection transforms transient beauty into an everyday ritual of radiance.

mov_1345FE6B81168EE9FF6AF4F95869D2EF,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Kylie Jenner fans think her A Complete Unknown actor beau Timothee Chalamet is secretly with her on yacht vacation in Greece. That is because a man in black briefs was spotted resting on a seashore in one of her latest Instagram posts shared on Tuesday. 'That guy on the shore is Timothee,' said one fan on X while another piped up: 'He is secretly with her in Greece, I feel it in my bones.' The couple were last photographed together in St Tropez in the south of France on July 5. On the luxury trip Jenner was modeling a white, leopard print and polka dot swimsuit from her Frankies Bikinis/Khy collaboration while on a very large yacht. Also on the getaway with the 27-year-old reality TV star were her kids Stormi and Aire that she has with rapper ex Travis Scott. And her pal Stassie Karanikolaou, aka as Stassie Baby, was also spied during the European holiday. Rumors of their relationship between Jenner and Chalamet began circulating in April 2023, following the makeup mogul's split from Scott. They were first spotted together publicly in September 2023 at Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour concert. The couple then made their first official public appearance together at the U.S. Open in September 2023. 'Greeeece,' the mom of two captioned her update. Most of the pinup shots were of Kylie in bikinis. In the first image, The Kardashians star wore a tiny yellow and black Chanel string bikini as she sat on her knees on the yacht. Kylie tipped her head to one side in the shot and looked like she was rolling her eyes. In another snap, the reality TV star showered off as she climbed back onto the boat after a swim in the sea. In another photo, Kylie poured herself into a tiny leopard print bikini that highlighted her toned figure. Kylie turned up the heat with a photo of herself leaning against the railing of the yacht in a skin tight, curve hugging white dress. Other photos in the group included a shot of five women's feet in flip flops, a photo of her pink Chanel tote bag and a bunch of nature shots. Khloé Kardashian commented on her sister's post: 'Are you ever coming home?' A fan also mentioned seeing her on the yacht, writing, 'We saw your yacht in paxos!!! We drove past on a boat. hope ur having the best time.' A bunch of other fans commented along the lines of 'Oh girl your life is so fun' and 'what a life.' And many others complimented her beauty with comments such as 'How is someone this perfect' and 'sun-kissed beauty ❤️.' Kylie's trip to Greece comes after she introduced her collaboration with Frankie's Bikinis. The new swimwear collaboration is called Cloud Cups by Frankies Bikinis x KHY. 'I've always loved Frankies Bikinis, and I'm so excited to partner with them to create this collection – with incredibly flattering silhouettes in super soft material, these are the perfect pieces for summer,' Kylie told DailyMail.com in a statement. 'We've incorporated so many fun prints – from polka dots to leopard – and the styles are so comfortable, it feels like they float on your skin while lifting and sculpting. 'One of my favorite pieces is the Heavenly Satin top – the lace detail is so sweet, and it showcases the vintage aesthetic that this collection is all about.' 'Designing this collection with Kylie felt so natural, like two girls dreaming up their perfect swim drawer,' said Aiello, founder of Frankies Bikinis. 'We wanted each piece to lift, shape, and sculpt while wrapping the body in delicate support.' With six bikini top styles, bottoms that range from classic strings to fuller-coverage, and sun dresses and separates, Frankies Bikinis x KHY offers styles for every aesthetic. Beyond swim, Frankies Bikinis x KHY expands into limited edition mini dresses and easy separates. 'KHY aims to redefine the modern wardrobe by offering edited collections that seamlessly blends luxury with everyday style, spanning a diverse range of categories and styles. 'By collaborating with iconic brands and global designers, we hope that KHY will be a platform that delivers access to incredible fashion for everyone,' the company said in a statement. Frankies Bikinis is a female-led lifestyle brand recognized for its on-trend designs, innovative fabrics, and a commitment to crafting styles that make women feel more confident. Founded by mother-daughter duo Mimi and Francesca Aiello in their Malibu home in 2012, the brand has since grown into an internationally recognized company.","Have YOU got a story?

mov_D79A50B95A9CCCC5532131F5856F7F55,"  ABSTRACT The Museum of Arts and Design's ceramics collection inspires a self-described pottery nerd. FULL TEXT At the Museum of Arts and Design at 2 Columbus Circlein New York in early June, Jonathan Adler, the potter and founder of the home furnishings company that bears his name, looked up at a blue and white ceramic apothecary jar he had designed in 2018. It had wavering stripes and the letters LSD on it. ""It's a nod to my love of Delft pottery and reimagined as if the potter was on an acid trip,"" Adler said, adding that he does not partake. Around him, an opening night party for the show he had assembled from the museum's extensive ceramics collection and his own work raged and raved. Adler, 58, moved among family, friends and vitrines spotlighting notable ceramic art works that had inspired him since he was a pottery-obsessed ""nerd"" growing up in New Jersey. He often took the train to the institution then known as the American Craft Museum and located on East 53rd Street. Many of the 300 or so objects on display - divided into categories including animals, erotica, optimism, metallica and more - offered a provocative lesson about humor and irreverence in the history of ceramics. In a section about Americana, Adler's grenade vases and rocket decanters (inspired by euphemisms for inebriated like ""bombed,"" ""blasted"" and ""tanked"") sat in dialogue with Howard Kotler's American Supperware from the late 60s. Kotler's plates depict flags and the White House in states of collapse. ""His work spanned so many different ideas and not only mixed materials but mixed art with commerce,"" Adler said. A section devoted to erotica took in Adler's porcelain breast-patterned vases and his suggestive banana versions, playing off Marvin Lipofsky's glass lips from 1967. In a section concentrating on animals, Adler admired a 1994 cast bronze ""Monkey Chair"" with primate faces and bodies as arms, and swirling tails as the back. ""Judy Kensley McKie finds ways to toy with animal forms in an idiosyncratic and fantastic style,"" he said of the Boston-based sculptural furniture maker who is now in her 80s. As he breezed past works from the museum's collection, he admired them like old friends. ""Ruth Duckworth's work removes the noise of decoration to expose pure form,"" he said of her white cups backed with square blades. The section inspired by the Funk Ceramics movement that came out of San Francisco in the late 1960s (it included Robert Arneson, Viola Frey, Peter Voulkos and others) consisted almost entirely of jokes and gags. Adler's needlepoints of ""Shrooms,"" his shoe-sized acrylic pills and a gilded ceramic lollipop holder vied for laughs with Arneson's earthenware ""Self-Portrait of the Artist Losing His Marbles"" (1965) and David Gilhooly's ""Bread Frog as a Coffee Break"" (1981), a kind of miniature glazed earthenware totem pole. ""Funk is one of my favorite genres because it was subversive and weird and crazy and silly,"" Adler had said earlier in a slide presentation about the show. ""One of the things funk people loved was making puns, and it kind of shows how on some level language can stimulate creativity and how there's a dialogue between language and objects."" In fact, one of the first studios where he worked throwing pots, in Hell's Kitchen, was called Mud, Sweat & Tears. His stoneware ""Macho Macho Mugs"" made with faces of the Village People, is here for laughs, too, among walls that could almost be mistaken for a shop display, but with curatorial panels that analyze and comment. And yes, several Adler pieces are for sale in the museum shop - nothing new in a post-Keith Haring world of crossed lines of art, design and commerce in museums. ""If Kehinde Wiley or Takashi Murakami has a show, they have merchandise for sale in the shops, and a show also promotes sales in their galleries,"" said Ezra Shales, a professor of craft and design history at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, who teaches Adler to his students as an example of virtuosity in the way he makes humor look beautiful. ""Jonathan's work has historic references but without the weight,"" Shales explained. But joking aside, Adler's affection for the often overlooked medium runs deep. ""He's extremely knowledgeable about the history of ceramics, and has a lot to say about inspiration and technique,"" said Elissa Auther, the chief curator of the Museum of Arts and Design. She acknowledged that showing the work of a living designer has a commercial crossover but explained that she wanted to bring someone in to interpret the museum's collection alongside her own curatorial observations. Adler, she pointed out, knew how he wanted to display everything, and gave explicit directions to Simon Doonan, his husband and the creative director behind the cheeky window displays of the former Barneys New York. One corner of the show is a recreation of Adler's studio, with inspirational objects on shelves and clippings and quotes on the walls. ""Make Pots Not War,"" one reads. Adler's company, which was acquired this year by Consortium Brand Partners with plans to expand beyond his 10 locations in the United States and London, has annual sales of $150 million. Not bad for a Brown University undergraduate who took pottery classes down the hill at the Rhode Island School of Design (known as RISD) in the late 1980s and made, among other things, a Chanel teapot. ""But when I applied for their M.F.A. program in ceramics, they rejected me,"" he said. By 1992 the Museum of Arts and Design (operating then as the American Craft Museum) was selling one of his first striped ceramic vases, and in 1998, he opened his first store in SoHo. His career from there spun out (pun intended) to include the interior design of the Parker Palm Springs Hotel, serving as a judge on Bravo's ""Top Design"" and creating a life-size dream house in Malibu for Barbie's 50th anniversary. But even with all that, his potter's soul remains. He put it simply: ""I'm a grown man who gets to play with mud all day."" A couple of days after the opening, Adler was in his studio on West Broadway in SoHo, which is behind a window in the back of his kaleidoscopic store full of chandeliers, sofas, pillows, and myriad midcentury-inflected objects that he has referred to as his ""prescription for antidepressive living."" Two of his associates were muddy from sculpting the Foo Dog vases that Adler, who still tries out new ideas as maquettes in clay, had imagined. On the shelves all kinds of past design ideas thrown on a wheel and often fired in the kiln on site - ashtrays, vases, busts and more - had accumulated like so many spurned lovers. ""So many things I make fail,"" Adler sighed. ""The truth is that every idea I have is ridiculous and to try to make anything when there are so many things on the planet already is preposterous, I know that, but to do what I do you have to have a bubbling sense of possibility."" He looked over a set of ashtrays he named for decidedly unglamorous towns. ""They're going to bomb,"" he said. ""But I challenge myself to not be too rational.""

mov_BDD0CF6FDD0DFFE33541F1948EE0C4A3,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Olivia Attwood has hit back at backlash over her upcoming gig on This Morning after cruel trolls insisted it 'wouldn't work'. The former Love Island star, 34, who is a regular Loose Women panellist, is joining the This Morning team as a summer host in the coming weeks. While she's built a successful career fronting multiple ITV documentaries and reality shows, the news of Olivia's new slot didn't go down a hit with some fans. Traditionalists went as far as threatening they'll 'definitely stop watching' if Olivia joins the morning show. But ITV's golden girl Olivia has assured she is determined to succeed in the new gig and prove the haters wrong. She exclusively told The Sun: 'Those who know me understand the hard work I've put in to get where I am today. 'I'm forever grateful to Love Island for being the springboard to my career, but I'm excited to show there's so much more to me beyond the villa. 'It's been a lot of hard work, but I've always stayed focused on my goals and believed in myself and I'm very thankful for ITV in believing me.' Other stars who are fronting This Morning this summer include Sian Welby, Dermot O'Leary, Emma Willis, Josie Gibson, Rochelle Humes, Joel Dommett, Craig Doyle, and Andi Peters. Recently Olivia hit out at the 'stigma' of being the partner of a successful sportsman, insisting she funds her own lavish lifestyle and has worked 'relentlessly' since being catapulted to fame when she left the Love Island villa in 2017. She became a bona fide WAG when she tied the knot with footballer Bradley Dack in a lavish central London ceremony in the summer of 2023. The TV personality dated Bradley, 31, prior to entering the ITV reality show and he was already a footballer playing for League Two team Gillingham FC. Olivia slammed 'gold digger' claims and said it doesn't matter what job her husband has because she works 'seven days a week'. She told MailOnline: 'I think people are like, ""She works seven days a week, surely she's got some f*****g cash"". 'Maybe in the beginning when Brad and I first started dating, there was a bit of a stigma around it [dating someone who plays sport for a living]. 'And people can kind of go, ""Oh"", a bit of an eye roll and stupid comments like, ""Oh my gosh she's with him cos he plays football"". 'I've got my own money, so it doesn't really matter what he does for a job.' Straight-talking Olivia shot to fame thanks to her stint in the Love Island villa in the summer of 2017, which saw her reach the show final with her ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes, 32, who she dated until February 2018. The former grid girl has since become a household name and a regular face on TV, appearing on The Only Way Is Essex, I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! , This Morning and Loose Women. Olivia has also fronted many of her own shows and presented Bad Boyfriends, Getting Filthy Rich and The Price Of Perfection - admitting she has 'bitten the hands off' TV executives for 'big jobs, little jobs, whatever I could get'. But this success did not come overnight and she told how she 'grafted' when she left the villa while working relentlessly to get where she is today. Olivia told MailOnline: 'Post Love Island, I knew where I wanted to be. I knew I wanted to stay working in television, and I was very dedicated to that, and everything I've done is working towards that bigger goal. 'I've been very patient and I've learnt the craft, I'm still learning, I've taken the big jobs, the little jobs, whatever I could get, I just bite their hand off for it.' 'Relentlessly pursuing that bigger goal and I'm working really hard at it, it doesn't come overnight', she added. 'Even when you get a big platform like Love Island, you still need to prove yourself to people. 'I think sometimes people become impatient off the back of reality shows, but these kind of things, they don't happen overnight, you have to stick with it. It takes graft.' Olivia has enjoyed the spoils of a lavish lifestyle thanks to her lucrative television career and is regularly seen toting around Chanel and Hermes handbags. She has also enjoyed many luxurious trips throughout the years - in the last nine weeks she has been seen in France, Miami and Ibiza. In her popular TV documentary, Price Of Perfection, Olivia was very candid about her own cosmetic tweakments and confessed she spends a 'couple of grand a month' maintaining her image.","Have YOU got a story?

While she's built a successful career fronting multiple ITV documentaries and reality shows, the news of Olivia's new slot didn't go down a hit with some fans. Traditionalists went as far as threatening they'll 'definitely stop watching' if Olivia joins the morning show. But ITV's golden girl Olivia has assured she is determined to succeed in the new gig and prove the haters wrong. She exclusively told The Sun: 'Those who know me understand the hard work I've put in to get where I am today. 'I'm forever grateful to Love Island for being the springboard to my career, but I'm excited to show there's so much more to me beyond the villa. 'It's been a lot of hard work, but I've always stayed focused on my goals and believed in myself and I'm very thankful for ITV in believing me.' Other stars who are fronting This Morning this summer include Sian Welby, Dermot O'Leary, Emma Willis, Josie Gibson, Rochelle Humes, Joel Dommett, Craig Doyle, and Andi Peters. Recently Olivia hit out at the 'stigma' of being the partner of a successful sportsman, insisting she funds her own lavish lifestyle and has worked 'relentlessly' since being catapulted to fame when she left the Love Island villa in 2017. She became a bona fide WAG when she tied the knot with footballer Bradley Dack in a lavish central London ceremony in the summer of 2023. The TV personality dated Bradley, 31, prior to entering the ITV reality show and he was already a footballer playing for League Two team Gillingham FC. Olivia slammed 'gold digger' claims and said it doesn't matter what job her husband has because she works 'seven days a week'. She told MailOnline: 'I think people are like, ""She works seven days a week, surely she's got some f*****g cash"". 'Maybe in the beginning when Brad and I first started dating, there was a bit of a stigma around it [dating someone who plays sport for a living]. 'And people can kind of go, ""Oh"", a bit of an eye roll and stupid comments like, ""Oh my gosh she's with him cos he plays football"". 'I've got my own money, so it doesn't really matter what he does for a job.' Straight-talking Olivia shot to fame thanks to her stint in the Love Island villa in the summer of 2017, which saw her reach the show final with her ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes, 32, who she dated until February 2018. The former grid girl has since become a household name and a regular face on TV, appearing on The Only Way Is Essex, I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! , This Morning and Loose Women. Olivia has also fronted many of her own shows and presented Bad Boyfriends, Getting Filthy Rich and The Price Of Perfection - admitting she has 'bitten the hands off' TV executives for 'big jobs, little jobs, whatever I could get'. But this success did not come overnight and she told how she 'grafted' when she left the villa while working relentlessly to get where she is today. Olivia told MailOnline: 'Post Love Island, I knew where I wanted to be. I knew I wanted to stay working in television, and I was very dedicated to that, and everything I've done is working towards that bigger goal. 'I've been very patient and I've learnt the craft, I'm still learning, I've taken the big jobs, the little jobs, whatever I could get, I just bite their hand off for it.' 'Relentlessly pursuing that bigger goal and I'm working really hard at it, it doesn't come overnight', she added. 'Even when you get a big platform like Love Island, you still need to prove yourself to people. 'I think sometimes people become impatient off the back of reality shows, but these kind of things, they don't happen overnight, you have to stick with it. It takes graft.' Olivia has enjoyed the spoils of a lavish lifestyle thanks to her lucrative television career and is regularly seen toting around Chanel and Hermes handbags. She has also enjoyed many luxurious trips throughout the years - in the last nine weeks she has been seen in France, Miami and Ibiza. In her popular TV documentary, Price Of Perfection, Olivia was very candid about her own cosmetic tweakments and confessed she spends a 'couple of grand a month' maintaining her image.",2025-07-15 20:18:14,en,WEB,,dailymail,,,1,False,False,"The text is an article about Olivia Attwood's TV career and personal life.

mov_41BE45CE71F9929B1FDDF938DAAA9A99,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Kylie Jenner showed off her bare face in a sweet makeup tutorial with daughter Stormi, as she revealed the lesson she taught her little one about natural beauty. The lipkit mogul, 27, shared an adorable video with the seven-year-old on Tuesday as they filmed a 'get ready with me' while vacationing in Greece. During the clip, Kylie — who was using Kylie Cosmetics products in the video — revealed the crucial natural beauty lesson she imparted to her daughter. 'Mommy always tells you, though, you're the most beautiful without...' she said, trailing off, as Stormi completed the sentence, stating, 'Makeup.' 'Yes,' Kylie — who recently stunned fans with a 'nasty looking' plastic surgery scar from a breast augmentation — responded. 'Our first GRWM together we always make vids together for fun and i never post them but this was just tooooo cute, ' Kylie — who shares Stormi and son Aire, three, with ex Travis Scott, 34 — captioned the clip. Timothée Chalamet's girlfriend started out the clip showing off her natural features while wearing a plush cream robe. 'It's Stormi,' Kylie playfully started out the clip, jokingly switching out their names, after Stormi introduced herself as Kylie. 'We're gonna do our first-ever makeup tutorial together,' Kylie went on, revealing that they were going to start with the Kylie Cosmetics Lip Butter. 'Really glossy,' Stormi remarked, after smacking her lips. Stormi then moved on to the blush as Kylie put on her foundation. The proud mom then explained how her little one enjoys makeup. 'Stormi likes to play with my makeup sometimes, but obviously, she doesn't wear makeup yet,' the mom-of-two said. The duo then went on to apply mascara before adding concealer. Stormi then spoke about having fun on the luxury vacation. 'We are in Greece. I love the boat that we were on. I love the food. I love the water. The water's so warm,' she sweetly shared. Kylie then asked if Stormi liked 'having sleepovers with Mommy every night' to which she replied 'yes.' Stormi then showed off how she applied 'Mommy's dewy balm' as Kylie laughed and said 'You're so cute.' The two went on to apply blush, with Kylie choosing a mix of Summer Sorbet and Ladybug, and Stormi opting for Cheeky Mood. Kylie then applied her lip liner, as Stormi declared, 'Now, we're just waiting for Mommy to finish!' Earlier this week Kylie shared a video of her and Stormi dancing around in circles on a yacht while wearing robes with towels on their heads. She called her daughter her 'built-in-bestie for life.' She also shared the video to TikTok where she captioned it, 'can't see our haters from here.' She also shared videos of Stormi arriving in Greece. Kylie cheekily captioned that video, 'I want to be her.' Later she posted a video of Stormi going down the huge slide off the yacht into the sea. Kylie's girls' trip included four friends, among them her bestie, 28-year-old Stassie Karanikolaou. She shared a carousel of images earlier on Sunday of her time with the adults on the yacht. 'Greeeece,' the mom of two captioned that update. In the first image, The Kardashians star wore a tiny yellow and black Chanel string bikini as she sat on her knees on the yacht. In another snap, the reality TV star showered off as she climbed back onto the boat after a swim in the sea. Khloé Kardashian commented on her sister's post: 'Are you ever coming home?' Many of Jenner's fans think her A Complete Unknown actor beau Timothee is secretly with her on the yacht vacation. That is because a man in black briefs was spotted resting on a seashore in one of her latest Instagram posts shared on Tuesday. 'That guy on the shore is Timothee,' said one fan on X while another piped up: 'He is secretly with her in Greece, I feel it in my bones.' The couple were last photographed together in St Tropez in the south of France on July 5.","Have YOU got a story?

mov_B1A1B9894E7C126EA2B6857C84DD6681,"  T his season, Paris Haute Couture Week unfolded with a rare emotional intensity tinged with farewells, steeped in theatricality, and grounded in masterful craftsmanship. From Demna's final bow at Balenciaga to Daniel Roseberry's golden surrealism at Schiaparelli, the Fall/Winter 2025 collections revealed fashion at its most transcendent. Balenciaga: Demna's swansong All eyes were on Balenciaga for what was confirmed as Demna's final couture collection for the house. The Georgian designer closed this chapter with restraint and poetry, stripping away the irony that defined his earlier years. The silhouettes were sharply architectural but softened with sweeping cloaks, delicate veils, and a palette of moody neutrals. A standout moment was a floor-length coat that was constructed entirely from repurposed opera gloves, a quiet metaphor for legacy and transformation. Schiaparelli: Gold-drenched dreams At Schiaparelli, Daniel Roseberry leaned unapologetically into fantasy. The collection was a gilded dreamscape, with impossibly cinched waists, structured surrealist bodices, and embroidery inspired by celestial maps. A sculptural gold bustier molded like molten armour stole the show, echoing Elsa Schiaparelli's historic love of the otherworldly. Roseberry's strength lies in making the improbable seem inevitable, and this season was no exception. Maison Margiela: Galliano's theatrical reverie John Galliano returned to the Margiela runway with another avant-garde opera of texture, shadow, and emotion. The show was held at midnight in an abandoned Parisian ballroom, where models emerged like haunted muses in deconstructed ballgowns, feathers soaked in ink, and corsetry layered over raw silks. The collection was both disturbing and divine, and as much of a performance piece as it is couture. Iris van Herpen: A return to the ethereal unknown Making a much-anticipated return to the physical runway, Iris van Herpen unveiled a collection that pushed the limits of form and futurism. Inspired by bioluminescent sea creatures and celestial structures, her creations hovered between nature and technology. Dresses crafted from laser-cut organza and 3D-printed filaments shimmered with otherworldly light, while one kinetic bodice appeared to breathe with the body itself. In a week ruled by emotion and legacy, van Herpen offered a glimpse into a future where couture is an extension of evolution itself. Chanel: A reimagined romance At the Grand Palais Éphémère, Chanel presented a collection that nodded to its codes while reaching for something more nuanced. Virginie Viard played with dualities – masculine-feminine, hard-soft – with boucle suiting reimagined as sweeping coatdresses and soft tulle paired with structured leather. While subdued, the collection whispered of evolution, not reinvention , and hinted at a possible turning point for the Maison's next chapter. Armani Privé: Liquid elegance Armani Privé delivered a masterclass in fluidity. Draped silks and sequined gowns shimmered like water under moonlight, with a colour story that moved from moonstone silver to deep sapphire. The pieces felt effortless, though every fold was deliberate. The atmosphere was serene and the craftsmanship flawless, which served as a reminder that quiet elegance never goes out of style .

Für eine gebrauchte Handtasche. Verkratzt, verranzt - und vermutlich mit einem ganz eigenen Geruchscocktail aus altem Leder, Parfümresten und konservierter Zeitgeschichte. Was für viele nach Wahnsinn klingt, ist für Verkaufspsychologen ein glasklares Signal: Story gepaart mit Verknappung verkauft. Am 10. Juli 2025 wurde in Paris das erste Exemplar der legendären Hermès Birkin Bag versteigert. Die Tasche gehörte Jane Birkin persönlich - der britisch-französischen Schauspielerin, Sängerin und Stil-Ikone, nach der das Modell benannt ist. Innerhalb weniger Minuten stieg das Bietgefecht auf 10 Millionen Dollar. Der Käufer: Valuence-CEO Shinsuke Sakimoto. Seine Begründung: ""Es geht nicht um Mode. Es geht um Geschichte."" Und genau da liegt der Kern: Menschen zahlen nicht für Produkte. Sie zahlen für Bedeutung. Vom Flugzeug-Kotztütchen zum Mythos Die Entstehungsgeschichte der Birkin Bag ist selbst ein Paradebeispiel für echtes Storytelling. 1984 saß Jane Birkin in einem Flugzeug neben dem damaligen Hermès-CEO Jean-Louis Dumas. Ihre Klage: ""Ich finde nie eine Tasche, in die alles reinpasst."" Dumas nahm eine Kotztüte - und kritzelte darauf den ersten Entwurf der Bag, die später nach ihr benannt wurde. Was folgte, war kein geplanter Marketing-Launch. Es entstand ein Mythos, der in Jahrzehnten immer weiter aufgeladen wurde: mit Wartelisten, limitierter Verfügbarkeit, Prominenz - und mit echtem psychologischen Sog. Und Mythen riechen nicht nach neuem Leder. Sie riechen nach Erinnerung, Geschichte und Nähe. Der Geruch des Begehrens In der Verkaufspsychologie zählt der Geruchssinn zu den stärksten emotionalen Triggern. Der Duft von altem Leder, getragen über Jahrzehnte von einer Stilikone, löst im limbischen System unmittelbare Reaktionen aus: Nostalgie, Faszination, Verbindung. Nicht trotz des Geruchs - sondern wegen ihm. Denn dieser Duft ist keine Parfümnote aus dem Hermès-Katalog. Es ist die olfaktorische Aura einer Ära: Zigarettenrauch in Pariser Cafés. Chanel N°5. Wildheit. Eleganz. Feminismus. 80er-Jahre. Eine Geschichte, konserviert im Geruch. Und genau das kaufen Sammler: Erlebbare Geschichte. Keine Funktion. Keine Frische. Was Unternehmen daraus lernen müssen Wer heute Kunden gewinnen will, braucht mehr als Qualität und Features. Er braucht eine Marke mit emotionaler Relevanz. Die Birkin Bag zeigt eindrucksvoll, wie stark Storytelling als Verkaufsgrund wirken kann - unabhängig von Branche oder Preisniveau. Es sind nicht die Materialien, die verkaufen. Es ist die Bedeutung dahinter. Erstens: Facts tell, Stories sell! Unternehmen müssen daher gezielt ihre Entstehungsgeschichten, Hintergründe oder Aha-Momente kommunizieren. Menschen kaufen, was sie spüren - nicht, was sie verstehen. Zweitens: Nostalgie wirkt. Der Rückgriff auf Herkunft, Retro-Anleihen oder handwerkliche Tradition aktiviert Vertrauen.

The new season, which launchs July 16 on Spotify, YouTube Music, and Apple Podcasts, explores themes of home through intimate conversations recorded at La Pausa, Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel's newly restored French Riviera villa that once hosted 20th century luminaries including Salvador Dalí, Jean Cocteau, and Misia Sert. Tribeca Festival and Chanel Announce 2025 Artist Awards Program Participants CalArts, Chanel Launch Center for Artists and Tech With AI Focus Tilda Swinton, Apichatpong Weerasethakul Join Forces for Chanel's Asian Cinema Initiatives “Gabrielle Chanel's villa, La Pausa, was a home of extraordinary creativity, where ideas evolved naturally among the olive groves and lavender. It's a perfect setting for the fifth season of Chanel Connects, which was recorded within the very rooms where Salvador Dali created 11 paintings, Misia Sert triumphed on the piano, and Jean Cocteau crafted his poetry,” said Yana Peel, president of arts, culture and heritage at Chanel. “This season, we hear from today's creative pioneers. Through a series of conversations, they discuss what's new and next in culture.” Nyong'o, who serves as a Chanel House ambassador, opens the season in conversation with philosopher Emanuele Coccia, author of “Philosophy of the Home,” exploring how concepts of home have evolved in the digital age. The Oscar winner, who has lived in Kenya, Mexico, and the U.S., reflects on her relationship to place: “I've adapted and grown with the places I've called home.” She also shares her perspective on storytelling's power, noting that “stories have the power to be a momentary home.” Episode two pairs Hayward with artist Allison Katz, whose work is held in collections including London's Tate Modern and Los Angeles' Hammer Museum. The duo discusses parallels between dance and painting, with Hayward offering her take on technology's role in performance: “In a world of AI, you can't replace real life performance.” Katz, meanwhile, speaks to artistic risk-taking: “It's important to risk my own story to get at something that goes beyond it.” The season continues with New Yorker writer Lauren Collins joining performance art duo Gerard & Kelly to explore dance language and the legacy of Americans on the French Riviera. Gerard & Kelly reflect on artistic evolution, suggesting that “maybe that's how art moves forward, in the blind spots,” while Collins observes that “somehow we always tell our own story through our work.” Michelin-starred chef Mauro Colagreco, who is also a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, connects with Paris-based artist Matthew Lutz-Kinoy in episode four. The conversation centers on creative ecology, with both artists drawing from their French surroundings while maintaining connections to their respective Argentine and international backgrounds. The season concludes with American artist Adam Pendleton in conversation with Peel herself, examining how technology will shape art's future. Pendleton, whose work was recently acquired by MoMA and featured at the Hirshhorn, also discusses his passion project preserving Nina Simone's childhood home. Chanel Connects is produced as part of the Chanel Culture Fund, which supports a network of creators and innovators through various programs including Art Partners, the Chanel Next Prize, and partnerships with institutions from CalArts to the Venice Biennale.

The new season, which launchs July 16 on Spotify, YouTube Music, and Apple Podcasts, explores themes of home through intimate conversations recorded at La Pausa, Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel's newly restored French Riviera villa that once hosted 20th century luminaries including Salvador Dalí, Jean Cocteau, and Misia Sert. More from Variety “Gabrielle Chanel's villa, La Pausa, was a home of extraordinary creativity, where ideas evolved naturally among the olive groves and lavender. It's a perfect setting for the fifth season of Chanel Connects, which was recorded within the very rooms where Salvador Dali created 11 paintings, Misia Sert triumphed on the piano, and Jean Cocteau crafted his poetry,” said Yana Peel, president of arts, culture and heritage at Chanel. “This season, we hear from today's creative pioneers. Through a series of conversations, they discuss what's new and next in culture.” Nyong'o, who serves as a Chanel House ambassador, opens the season in conversation with philosopher Emanuele Coccia, author of “Philosophy of the Home,” exploring how concepts of home have evolved in the digital age. The Oscar winner, who has lived in Kenya, Mexico, and the U.S., reflects on her relationship to place: “I've adapted and grown with the places I've called home.” She also shares her perspective on storytelling's power, noting that “stories have the power to be a momentary home.” Episode two pairs Hayward with artist Allison Katz, whose work is held in collections including London's Tate Modern and Los Angeles' Hammer Museum. The duo discusses parallels between dance and painting, with Hayward offering her take on technology's role in performance: “In a world of AI, you can't replace real life performance.” Katz, meanwhile, speaks to artistic risk-taking: “It's important to risk my own story to get at something that goes beyond it.” The season continues with New Yorker writer Lauren Collins joining performance art duo Gerard & Kelly to explore dance language and the legacy of Americans on the French Riviera. Gerard & Kelly reflect on artistic evolution, suggesting that “maybe that's how art moves forward, in the blind spots,” while Collins observes that “somehow we always tell our own story through our work.” Michelin-starred chef Mauro Colagreco, who is also a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, connects with Paris-based artist Matthew Lutz-Kinoy in episode four. The conversation centers on creative ecology, with both artists drawing from their French surroundings while maintaining connections to their respective Argentine and international backgrounds. The season concludes with American artist Adam Pendleton in conversation with Peel herself, examining how technology will shape art's future. Pendleton, whose work was recently acquired by MoMA and featured at the Hirshhorn, also discusses his passion project preserving Nina Simone's childhood home. Chanel Connects is produced as part of the Chanel Culture Fund, which supports a network of creators and innovators through various programs including Art Partners, the Chanel Next Prize, and partnerships with institutions from CalArts to the Venice Biennale. The podcast amplifies voices across disciplines and generations, tackling contemporary cultural issues while honoring Chanel's century-long commitment to the arts. Best of Variety Sign up for .

Juli 2025 Eine verranzte Tasche bringt 10 Millionen Dollar bei einer Auktion - Was Unternehmen daraus lernen müssen 10 Millionen Dollar. Für eine gebrauchte Handtasche. Verkratzt, verranzt - und vermutlich mit einem ganz eigenen Geruchscocktail aus altem Leder, Parfümresten und konservierter Zeitgeschichte. Was für viele nach Wahnsinn klingt, ist für Verkaufspsychologen ein glasklares Signal: Story gepaart mit Verknappung verkauft. Am 10. Juli 2025 wurde in Paris das erste Exemplar der legendären Hermès Birkin Bag versteigert. Die Tasche gehörte Jane Birkin persönlich - der britisch-französischen Schauspielerin, Sängerin und Stil-Ikone, nach der das Modell benannt ist. Innerhalb weniger Minuten stieg das Bietgefecht auf 10 Millionen Dollar. Der Käufer: Valuence-CEO Shinsuke Sakimoto. Seine Begründung: ""Es geht nicht um Mode. Es geht um Geschichte."" Und genau da liegt der Kern: Menschen zahlen nicht für Produkte. Sie zahlen für Bedeutung. Vom Flugzeug-Kotztütchen zum Mythos Die Entstehungsgeschichte der Birkin Bag ist selbst ein Paradebeispiel für echtes Storytelling. 1984 saß Jane Birkin in einem Flugzeug neben dem damaligen Hermès-CEO Jean-Louis Dumas. Ihre Klage: ""Ich finde nie eine Tasche, in die alles reinpasst."" Dumas nahm eine Kotztüte - und kritzelte darauf den ersten Entwurf der Bag, die später nach ihr benannt wurde. Was folgte, war kein geplanter Marketing-Launch. Es entstand ein Mythos, der in Jahrzehnten immer weiter aufgeladen wurde: mit Wartelisten, limitierter Verfügbarkeit, Prominenz - und mit echtem psychologischen Sog. Und Mythen riechen nicht nach neuem Leder. Sie riechen nach Erinnerung, Geschichte und Nähe. Der Geruch des Begehrens In der Verkaufspsychologie zählt der Geruchssinn zu den stärksten emotionalen Triggern. Der Duft von altem Leder, getragen über Jahrzehnte von einer Stilikone, löst im limbischen System unmittelbare Reaktionen aus: Nostalgie, Faszination, Verbindung. Nicht trotz des Geruchs - sondern wegen ihm. Denn dieser Duft ist keine Parfümnote aus dem Hermès-Katalog. Es ist die olfaktorische Aura einer Ära: Zigarettenrauch in Pariser Cafés. Chanel N°5. Wildheit. Eleganz. Feminismus. 80er-Jahre. Eine Geschichte, konserviert im Geruch. Und genau das kaufen Sammler: Erlebbare Geschichte. Keine Funktion. Keine Frische. Was Unternehmen daraus lernen müssen Wer heute Kunden gewinnen will, braucht mehr als Qualität und Features. Er braucht eine Marke mit emotionaler Relevanz. Die Birkin Bag zeigt eindrucksvoll, wie stark Storytelling als Verkaufsgrund wirken kann - unabhängig von Branche oder Preisniveau. Es sind nicht die Materialien, die verkaufen. Es ist die Bedeutung dahinter. Erstens: Facts tell, Stories sell! Unternehmen müssen daher gezielt ihre Entstehungsgeschichten, Hintergründe oder Aha-Momente kommunizieren. Menschen kaufen, was sie spüren - nicht, was sie verstehen. Zweitens: Nostalgie wirkt. Der Rückgriff auf Herkunft, Retro-Anleihen oder handwerkliche Tradition aktiviert Vertrauen. Marken, die bewusst Geschichte oder Herkunft inszenieren, schaffen Identifikation - und heben sich in einem Meer aus glatten Werbeflächen deutlich ab....","SPR_COMBO[de]psychologie, die verkauft, 16.

Verkratzt, verranzt - und vermutlich mit einem ganz eigenen Geruchscocktail aus altem Leder, Parfümresten und konservierter Zeitgeschichte. Was für viele nach Wahnsinn klingt, ist für Verkaufspsychologen ein glasklares Signal: Story gepaart mit Verknappung verkauft. Am 10. Juli 2025 wurde in Paris das erste Exemplar der legendären Hermès Birkin Bag versteigert. Die Tasche gehörte Jane Birkin persönlich - der britisch-französischen Schauspielerin, Sängerin und Stil-Ikone, nach der das Modell benannt ist. Innerhalb weniger Minuten stieg das Bietgefecht auf 10 Millionen Dollar. Der Käufer: Valuence-CEO Shinsuke Sakimoto. Seine Begründung: ""Es geht nicht um Mode. Es geht um Geschichte."" Und genau da liegt der Kern: Menschen zahlen nicht für Produkte. Sie zahlen für Bedeutung. Vom Flugzeug-Kotztütchen zum Mythos Die Entstehungsgeschichte der Birkin Bag ist selbst ein Paradebeispiel für echtes Storytelling. 1984 saß Jane Birkin in einem Flugzeug neben dem damaligen Hermès-CEO Jean-Louis Dumas.

Kürzlich wurden die Erben des Walmart-Gründers wieder als die wohlhabendste Familie der Welt bezeichnet. Die Waltons sind wieder die reichste Familie der Welt. Sie laufen mit ihrem milliardenschweren Vermögen vielen Königshäusern, Industriedynastien und US-Tech-Milliardären den Rang ab. Die Erben des US-Handelsunternehmens Walmart haben ihr Vermögen seit 2023 um 66 Prozent auf einen Rekordwert von 432 Milliarden Dollar (411 Milliarden Euro) gesteigert. Sie stehen nun wieder auf Platz 1 der jährlichen „Bloomberg“-Liste der reichsten Familien der Welt. Reichste Familie der Welt steigert ihr Vermögen: Die Walmart-Aktie legte eine Kursrally hin Den Waltons gehören gut 46 Prozent des größten Einzelhändlers der Welt mit rund 10.600 Filialen. Im Jahr 1962 hatte Firmengründer Sam Walton seinen ersten Supermarkt im US-Bundesstaat Arkansas eröffnet. Das Unternehmen schaffte in den Folgejahren ein rasantes Wachstum. Die Familie ist noch immer im Unternehmen tätig, wenn auch in zunehmend eingeschränktem Maße. Im vergangenen Jahr schied der Sohn des Gründers, Rob Walton, im Alter von 79 Jahren aus dem Aufsichtsrat aus. Sein Neffe war damit der einzig verbliebene Walton in dem Gremium. Der Grund für das neue Rekord-Vermögen: Die Walmart-Aktie hatte zuletzt eine Rekordrally hingelegt. Der Aktienkurs stieg im Laufe des Jahres um gut 80 Prozent. In der Folge überholte die Gründerfamilie die Herrscherfamilie von Abu Dhabi, die Al Nahyans. , die mit ihren weit verzweigten Investitionen auf Rang zwei abrutschten – mit 323,9 Milliarden Dollar Vermögen. Die reichste europäische Familie kommt aus Frankreich Bloomberg untersucht jedes Jahr, welche Familien der Welt die reichsten sind. Die Fachleute betrachten nur Familien ab der Generation nach dem Gründer. Deshalb taucht zum Beispiel der US-Unternehmer Elon Musk in dieser Liste nicht auf. Ebenfalls nicht dabei sind Einzelerben und Familien, bei denen zu unklar oder unübersichtlich ist, woher der Reichtum genau stammt. Die Liste ist nicht ganz genau und enthält Schätzwerte. Alle Vermögen werden in Dollar umgerechnet, um sie vergleichen zu können. Sicher ist allerdings: Mit ihrem Geld übersteigt die Walton-Familie den Marktwert der größten amerikanischen Konzerne wie Home Depot mit 412 Milliarden Dollar (392 Milliarden Euro), der Konsumgüterkonzern Procter & Gamble mit 402 Milliarden Dollar (383 Milliarden Euro) oder Netflix mit 396 Milliarden Dollar (377 Milliarden Euro).

'I was at Zephyr in Notting Hill, I was sat outside. My whole bag  - my bag was between my feet , squeezed between my feet and this man managed to get the whole thing.' She added: 'Me and my sister were talking about juicy gossip so I feel like that did get in the way but can you believe? My entire bag, my brand new , first ever, vintage Chanel is dead.' She then shared a clip from CCTV showing the exact moment a man stole her bag as she enjoyed her meal.

Anastasia Nysten (AN): Vladimir, how would you define yourself? Vladimir Antaki (VA): I am still in the process of discovering that. I am not the same person I was a year ago or even five years ago. While this may sound cliché, it is a truth I have come to accept. Significant events in my life, as well as in the lives of those close to me, have shaped my personality. I believe I have evolved in a positive direction – or, at least, I hope so. AN: Let us begin from the very start. You were born in Saudi Arabia, correct? VA: Yes. My parents left Lebanon during the civil war, married in 1978, and soon moved to Saudi Arabia, where my sister and I were born. When I was two, we relocated to France, settling in La Défense 2000 in Puteaux, surrounded by other Lebanese families. I'm deeply aware of how lucky we were to escape the conflict, especially knowing what many families endured. Growing up in 1980s France was a privilege, filled with joy, play, and a strong community. My memories from that time feel magical — and I now view them with both gratitude and a sense of responsibility. We lived near La Défense, and the Esplanade and Les Quatre Temps mall became my playground. I even watched the construction of l'Arche de la Défense. That environment greatly influenced my creative vision. It was a more innocent time — children played outside, fully immersed in the world around them, unlike today's screen-driven childhood. I also developed a love for cinema early on, thanks to my parents. Films like Ghostbusters, Gremlins, and Jurassic Park left a lasting impression on me. The cultural vibe of the '80s and '90s shaped my perspective, while my stylish, strong-willed mother had firm ideas about my future. Her dominance made me question authority and pushed me to find my own path. In 2003, I moved to Canada to gain independence in Montréal, where I had family living. It was a turning point. The city felt fresh and inspiring — changing your environment changes the way you see the world. I spent days exploring, meeting people, and photographing everything with an analog camera. That's where my passion for photography deepened. I learned film development, darkroom techniques, and honed my craft — even though visa issues kept me financially reliant on my parents for a time. Vladimir Antaki's business card. Photograph © Vladimir Antaki. AN: How did you take that first step? VA: I needed a business card, so I used a photo that my Gibran had taken of me wearing his Chanel glasses. It felt right. I cropped my face, added “514 963 VLAD” and a website, and printed it Polaroid-style to reflect my alter ego. I first handed it out at a fashion event on 4 June 2008. Gibran got me into the VIP section, where I met Frédéric Metz, head of design at UQÀM. Known for his bluntness, he surprised me by approving it. I took a photo of him holding the card. From there, the card drew attention. Two weeks later, I photographed Lady Gaga holding it — a turning point that gave the project major visibility. What started as a spontaneous idea grew into a portrait series featuring icons like Jimmy Fallon, Spike Lee, Christopher Lloyd, Juliette Binoche, John Waters, and Iggy Pop — many of them childhood heroes.

Pics by anaisindra , bag by chanel over luxury_for_you Lula Dean's Little Library of Banned Books by kristenmillerbooks is a sharp and witty satire set in a small Southern town, where personal rivalry becomes a battle over censorship and the freedom to read. Through a secret rebellion involving swapped book covers and hidden classics, the story explores serious issues like racism, homophobia and political manipulation with warmth, humor and intelligence. While the novel occasionally tries to cover too much ground and some characters lack nuance, its message about the power of books to challenge and change us remains compelling. ➡️ Ideal for fans of clever small-town dramas with big messages, this novel is a heartfelt ode to the transformative magic of reading. In The Phoenician Masterstroke by Wes Anderson tells a darkly whimsical tale about an arms dealer and his daughter on an investor-seeking road trip through a fictional Middle Eastern realm. With perfectly framed tableaux, dry humour, and a cast led brilliantly by Benicio del Toro and Mia Threapleton, the film blends absurdity and elegance with ease. In my opinion, it's a classic Anderson, just sharper, faster, and a touch more existential than usual. ➡️ If you've ever loved Anderson's cinematic dioramas, you'll want to take this ride. For the sceptics: it won't change your mind, but it might at least raise an eyebrow. I've always loved techno (yes, really) and  iampaulkalkbrenner is one of the genre's true pioneers. His music has accompanied me through countless writing sessions, and with Si Soy Fuego, he once again proves how powerful electronic music can be. Even better: he'll be on stage at ZOA City in Zurich on June 21 – and I can't wait. ➡️ A hymn to never stop dreaming, this track is made for balmy summer nights and everything that comes with them. #goodreads #booktok #wesanderson #music #paulkalkbrenner #zoa #zoacity #chanelbag #luxurylifestyle #cartierwatch #bookworm #reading #styleinspo #mystyle #ootd #chanel #summer2025","Hi lovelies!

If you loved the movies LITTLE MISS SUNSHINE or PAULIE, or the book REMARKABLY BRIGHT CREATURES, I hope you'll enjoy this one, too. A thousand thank-yous to my editor lauravdv, my agent Hannah Bowman, and ploy.siripant for the beautiful cover! Summary: Three estranged siblings―and a high-maintenance cockatoo―reunite in a luminous novel about forgiveness, connection, and the complexities of family by the author of Sorry for the Inconvenience. Upon the sudden deaths of their bird-obsessed parents, the three Shah siblings reunite. Aliza has spent years holding their crumbling family together, caring for their younger brother, Sammy. And Aden, named executor of the estate, finds himself resentfully facing the one member of the family who always got their parents' undivided love: their famous Bollywood-bopping cockatoo, Coco Chanel. One reckless night, Aden opens Coco's cage, letting her do what he did a decade ago: fly away from home. In a panic, the siblings set off to recover her, armed with only Coco's tracking chip and the fragile hope they might set things right. What they think will be a quick search and rescue becomes a two-week cross-country road trip, where old grudges resurface, relationships are tested, and long-buried dreams stir awake. As Coco, meanwhile, forges her own path to the past, Aden, Aliza, and Sammy follow―not just the bird, but the possibility of something more: a way back to each other. ✨Ready for preorder at http://bit.ly/4nXDSWk","Surprise!

mov_5B010ACE97FDE810D22274BA4F0BB83A,"  In the ever-evolving world of fashion, where trends come and go with the seasons, one phenomenon has managed to remain at the center of attention—designer dupes. These are products that mimic high-end designer items but come at a fraction of the cost. From handbags and shoes to sunglasses and belts, designer dupes are everywhere, especially in the age of social media and online shopping. But what exactly makes them so popular, and why are they both loved and criticized? What Are Designer Dupes? Designer dupes refer to items that closely resemble designer products but are not direct counterfeits. They do not carry the original brand's logo or trademarks but imitate the style, design, and overall appearance. For example, a bag that looks like a Chanel flap bag but is branded under a different name with a similar structure would be considered a dupe rather than a fake. It's important to differentiate designer dupes from counterfeit goods. While counterfeit items are illegal and violate trademark laws by directly copying logos and names, dupes typically operate in a legal gray area. They offer the look for less without falsely claiming to be the real thing. The Demand for Luxury on a Budget One of the biggest reasons behind the surge in popularity of designer dupes is affordability. Luxury fashion often comes with a hefty price tag that most consumers simply cannot justify or afford. A genuine Louis Vuitton handbag can cost upwards of $2,000, while a high-quality dupe may retail for under $100. For many fashion enthusiasts, designer dupes offer a way to enjoy the aesthetics of luxury without the financial burden. Social media influencers and fashion bloggers have played a major role in normalizing and even glamorizing designer dupes. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube are filled with content showcasing affordable alternatives to luxury goods. ""Dupe hauls"" and ""Look for Less"" videos have amassed millions of views, making designer dupes a mainstream trend. Ethical Considerations While designer dupes may seem like a harmless way to enjoy fashion, they do raise important ethical questions. Many argue that they undermine the originality and creative effort of designers. Luxury brands invest heavily in research, craftsmanship, and design innovation. When those ideas are replicated and sold cheaply, it can feel like a theft of intellectual property. Moreover, the production of designer dupes often lacks the transparency and ethical standards upheld by many luxury brands. Questions about fair labor practices, environmental impact, and product safety become harder to answer when dealing with fast fashion manufacturers. On the other hand, supporters of designer dupes argue that fashion should be inclusive and accessible. They believe that style should not be limited to those who can afford designer price tags. For many consumers, dupes are not about fooling others—they're about self-expression and participating in trends without breaking the bank. The Role of Fast Fashion Fast fashion brands have been instrumental in the rise of designer dupes. Companies like Zara, H&M, Shein, and Forever 21 have mastered the art of quickly turning runway styles into mass-produced garments. These brands often draw inspiration from luxury collections and deliver similar looks within weeks. While these versions are not exact replicas, they bear striking resemblances to the originals. For example, a coat that closely resembles one seen on a Balenciaga runway may find its way into a fast fashion store for a fraction of the cost. Such practices have blurred the lines between inspiration and imitation, further fueling the designer dupes culture. Quality vs. Price One of the major debates surrounding designer dupes is the trade-off between quality and price. Luxury brands are known for their craftsmanship, attention to detail, and use of premium materials. Dupes, on the other hand, often cut corners in terms of construction and materials to keep costs low. While some designer dupes are surprisingly well-made, others may fall apart after a few uses. Consumers need to manage their expectations. You're unlikely to get the same longevity or finish in a dupe that you would from an original. However, for trend-driven items that may only be worn a few times, many shoppers find the lower cost worth it. Shopping for Designer Dupes Responsibly If you choose to shop for designer dupes, there are responsible ways to do so. First, avoid counterfeit products that illegally use logos or names of designer brands. Stick to items that are inspired by the look but are sold under different branding. Second, research the brands and sellers you buy from. While dupes are not luxury items, you can still seek out those made under ethical working conditions and from sustainable materials....","In the ever-evolving world of fashion, where trends come and go with the seasons, one phenomenon has managed to remain at the center of attention—designer dupes.

Are two-piece matching sets still trendy? I wanted to find one for a casual summer event, but then I wondered if that look had passed its prime. - Yael, Bronx, N.Y. The coordinated ""set,"" known more colloquially as the co-ord set, that perfectly matching combination of top and bottom, has been part of the standard wardrobe for decades. What, after all, is a suit but a set with different vowels? It has, however, taken many forms over the years and ebbed and flowed in the public consciousness. The last time sets really became a thing was in the fall of 2021, after the Miu Miu show during Paris Fashion Week. That's when Miuccia Prada showed matching khaki or gray pleated micro-miniskirts and cropped jacket tops or cable knits, like a (yes) suit gone Britney Spears rogue. Before you could say ""social media catnip,"" the Miu Miu set had gone stratospheric, worn by Nicole Kidman on the cover of Vanity Fair as well as influencers by the truckload, reinforcing Mrs. Prada's position as the most powerful female designer in fashion. It was not, however, the first set, and it certainly won't be the last. The Juicy Couture tracksuit, beloved of Los Angeles denizens and celebrities everywhere in the early aughts, was a set. The fact that the aughts are currently enjoying a style renaissance, along with the whole set concept, is probably not a coincidence. Before that, Cher Horowitz's yellow plaid suit in ""Clueless"" was a set. The playsuit that rose to popularity in the 1960s was a set. In the 1920s, Coco Chanel loved a knit set, a coordinated cardigan and skirt inspired by clothing worn to play tennis and golf. Some historians trace the origins of the set back even further, to the 16th and 17th centuries, when men started wearing matching doublets and hose. As to why the set concept lasted so long, it's pretty simple. As the stylist Gabriella Karefa-Johnson told me when I asked, ""it makes life easier."" You don't have to worry about coordinating your clothes because they are already coordinated. It makes you look pulled together with pretty much zero effort. And it makes packing simpler because each look is essentially three or more in one since you can wear the top and bottom together or apart. One drawback to the concept, Ms. Karefa-Johnson said, is that it can become a crutch of sorts, a way of ceding responsibility in the morning that can atrophy the taste muscle. And since dressing is in part about showing others who you are as an individual, it can act more like camouflage than self-expression. Samira Nasr, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, said she tended to stay away from sets because she preferred looking ""as though something is a little off"" and giving her clothes an idiosyncrasy that is uniquely hers. And judging by recent debuts of new designers at big brands, like Michael Rider at Celine, with its mismatched classics, that kind of idiosyncrasy may be on the rise. But here's the thing about sets: You can always disaggregate the pieces and turn them into separates - you can always mix and unmatch them - and then re-aggregate according to taste. In that light, investing in a set is not being trendy. It's being smart.

mov_0DC9180D7E82AE1B32FD683CB6461B73,"  We have all come to love Nan St George in The Buccaneers, but we are curious about the person who brings this role to life. Kristine Froseth, the ethereal, blue-eyed beauty, is making the world go round in Apple TV+'s period drama, and we are most interested in getting to know her better. This 29-year-old Norwegian-American model-turned-actor, who is currently seen juggling between duty and love on The Buccaneers, has built her impressive career with a lot of hard work and determination. Let's have a look at some fascinating facts about her professional and personal life. The Buccaneers' Nan St George AKA Kristine Froseth Is of Norwegian Descent She was born in New Jersey to Norwegian parents and split her childhood years between the US and Oslo, Norway. Due to her father's job, they had to travel back and forth quite a lot. Kristine Froseth in The Buccaneers (Credit: Apple TV+) This meant a rich travel history and exposure for little Kristine, familiarizing her with American as well as European culture, cuisine, etiquette, and much more, shaping her into the confident woman she is today. She Was Discovered in a Norwegian Mall Art Age 16 Kristine Froseth was merely 16 when she was spotted in a mall in Norway, in a catwalk audition, and that's how she began her modelling career. She was also scouted by the IMG Models agency back in Jersey. Imagine being so young and your life changes completely! Kristine Froseth with Leighton Meester in The Buccaneers (Credit: Apple TV+) She went on to model for high-fashion brands like Miu Miu, Prada, Armani, Chloe, and Chanel. This marked the beginning of her glorious career at a very tender age. She grew from strength to strength and became a coveted name on the ramp, representing international brands with style. She Is An Ambassador For Chanel, Representing The Brand Globally Another feather in Kristine's cap is that she is an ambassador for Chanel and doesn't take the responsibility lightly. She is seen representing the brand on events and runway shows, dressed in pristine Chanel fits and accessories, creating jaw-dropping looks. Lizzy and Nan in The Buccaneers (Credit: Apple TV+) Speaking about her association with Chanel to Elle, she said: I always admired what the brand represented—what [Coco Chanel] did for females at the time, giving them freedom and more opportunity. Her life feels nothing short of a fairytale, from representing this prestigious brand globally, attending the MET Gala twice, to rubbing shoulders with some of the top names in the fashion and film industry. She Began Her Acting Career by Chance, on A Casting Director's Suggestion Froseth's acting career began when a casting director urged her to send her portfolio for the movie adaptation of John Green's famous novel Looking for Alaska. While the film was never made, she was cast in the pilot for a series called Let The Right One In. It was in the year 2017 that her first film, Rebel in the Rye released. Nan and Theo in The Buccaneers (Credit: Apple TV+) In 2018, she starred in Apostle and Sierra Burgess Is A Loser, besides a mini-series called The Truth About The Harry Quebert Affair. When the John Green novel was finally announced for a mini-series on Hulu, Froseth played the role of Alaska Young in it. She also starred in Birds of Paradise on Amazon Prime Video before landing her lead role as Nan St George in The Buccaneers on Apple TV+. She is An Advocate of Mental Health, Sharing Her Experiences to Help Others Having suffered through anxiety herself, Kristine shares her experiences, openly talking about therapy and inspiring people about getting help from professionals when required. Still from The Buccaneers (Credit: Apple TV+) Speaking to Frenshe about it, she said: Before therapy, I definitely struggled with not letting my anxiety run my life. I'm really glad I started getting help with my anxious thoughts. Once I stopped attaching myself to the emotion and thought, I was able to breathe through it and see anxiety as a physical state instead of letting it take me on a ride all of sorts of worst case scenarios or thoughts. She further urged anyone struggling with mental health issues to reach out and seek help and not give up on themselves. She is Drawn To Strong Female Roles that Display Strength This adds up with her portrayal of Nan St George, too. Kristine chooses roles where she has a strong voice and a purpose, and is not simply an arm candy. This can be seen in her career choices, right from playing the misled cult member in Apostle or Veronica in Sierra Burgess Is A Loser. Still from The Buccaneers (Credit: Apple TV+) As Nan in The Buccaneers, too, she is the voice of reason and is ready to go to any extent to protect the people she loves, even if that means sacrificing her happiness. Kristine Froseth, much like Nan St George, makes her own rules and lives her life on her terms. As the character draws strength from the actor, and vice versa, we are intrigued to see what new chapters of acting finesse this marvelous actor will bestow on us in the upcoming episodes of The Buccaneers! Are you looking forward to watching Nan's journey?

C7EA7B98D1CD31E208760ABEC8A3C0B1,"  They included glittery blood, metallic masks and a beating heart. This week, the world's richest and most devoted fashion hounds made their twice-annual trek to Paris to shop for custom clothes at the latest couture shows. On the scene were celebrities like Kim Kardashian, newlyweds like Lauren Sánchez Bezos and fashion superstars like the mononymic designer Demna, who presented his final collection for Balenciaga. Even as couture weeks have become circuslike spectacles involving tabloid and social media stars, their main draw is the imagination and artistry that designers showcase on runways. The collections contain the most expensive and exquisite clothes money can buy.

Schiaparelli's latest experimentations with the human form included a pale caped dress with beaded eyeballs, a silky red gown with a back resembling a female torso and a jeweled necklace that looked -- and beat -- like a heart. Robert Wun: Most in Bold Blood! Fashion drama would be one way to describe Robert Wun's white comforter-like gown splattered with bedazzled blood stains, which brought to mind works of Truman Capote and Alfred Hitchcock. Iris Van Herpen: Most Gaseous! The wispy translucent fabrics of three ethereal Iris van Herpen looks made each appear to waft through the room like a cloud of (odorless) gas. Viktor & Rolf: Most Mother Goose! A bonnet and prominent feathers were elements suggesting that the matriarch of children's literature was a muse for Viktor & Rolf's tiered confection. Balenciaga: Most Tablecloth! Lace fabric smoothed to perfection wasn't the only thing Balenciaga's ball gown had in common with grandma's favorite table dressing. The gown, like a proper tablecloth, also provided ample coverage. Maison Margiela: Most Bride of C-3PO! Shiny, shimmery, splendid: Maison Margiela's collection featured three lustrous looks complete with matching face coverings, all of which conjured the image of a glamorous robot at a wedding (and a rehearsal dinner and a farewell brunch). Chanel: Most Flight Suit! It will cost a lot more than a can of Red Bull, but Chanel's creamy suit with a feathered jacket does what the energy drink promises to: Give you wings. Rahul Mishra: Most Golden Snitch! Even when stationary, Rahul Mishra's curvy gold frock had the movement of the frenetic magical ball from the Harry Potter franchise. Viktor & Rolf: Most Oil Slick! Not only did Viktor & Rolf's pair of iridescent and jet black dresses have an oily palette, but the way that they appeared to float down the runway also recalled the way spilled oil moves across water. Balenciaga: Most Generational Wealth! Expensive clothes, as this list shows, do not have a uniform appearance. But the look of wealth -- particularly old money -- for the most part still does, and it was exemplified by Balenciaga's faux mink coat and sheer tie-neck dress. Rahul Mishra: Most Human Trellis! With sequined blooms orbiting the face, Rahul Mishra's rosy mini dress evoked nothing so much as a wearable Instagram or Snapchat filter. Robert Wun: Most Arms! A couple of Robert Wun looks offered a solution to a common scenario -- a situation when one could use an extra hand -- by incorporating prosthetic limbs into their bodice and veil. Viktor & Rolf: Most Bunker Buster! Heavy and dangerous are words to describe Viktor & Rolf's ensemble of sagging dark gown and spiky headpiece.

This week, the world's richest and most devoted fashion hounds made their twice-annual trek to Paris to shop for custom clothes at the latest couture shows. On the scene were celebrities like Kim Kardashian, newlyweds like Lauren Sánchez Bezos and fashion superstars like the mononymic designer Demna, who presented his final collection for Balenciaga. Even as couture weeks have become circuslike spectacles involving tabloid and social media stars, their main draw is the imagination and artistry that designers showcase on runways. The collections contain the most expensive and exquisite clothes money can buy.

mov_7B0C9175372D2490F6B317B5FC43C799,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Olivia Attwood has revealed how thieves tried to break-in to her Cheshire home but were stopped within minutes while she is away on holiday in Spain. The TV presenter, 34, shared how she 'pays through the nose for private security', who arrived within two minutes to try and apprehend the burglars. Olivia was targetted while out of the country, however her security system seemingly outsmarted the criminals who tried to gain entry to the £1million property. Throughout the night on Wednesday, Olivia shared with her followers that they had experienced an attempted break-in and warned the thieves she had their details. Sharing what had happened, Olivia said: 'That's why we pay through the nose for private security. On site in 2 minutes with dog team and the incredible nw police force not far behind. 'We saw your face, we have your foot prints and finger prints. And sorry what you were looking for isn't actually kept at the property.' Olivia has lived in the home with her footballer husband Bradley Dack and their two dogs, Lola and Stitch, since 2022. The star has shown fans inside her houses since 2020 when she began filming docu-series Olivia Meets Her Match about her relationship and homelife with Brad. This fresh blow comes as Olivia hit back at backlash over her upcoming gig on This Morning after cruel trolls insisted it 'wouldn't work'. Olivia, who is a regular Loose Women panellist, is joining the This Morning team as a summer host in the coming weeks. While she's built a successful career fronting multiple ITV documentaries and reality shows, the news of Olivia's new slot didn't go down a hit with some fans. Traditionalists went as far as threatening they'll 'definitely stop watching' if Olivia joins the morning show. But ITV's golden girl Olivia has assured she is determined to succeed in the new gig and prove the haters wrong. She exclusively told The Sun: 'Those who know me understand the hard work I've put in to get where I am today. 'I'm forever grateful to Love Island for being the springboard to my career, but I'm excited to show there's so much more to me beyond the villa. 'It's been a lot of hard work, but I've always stayed focused on my goals and believed in myself and I'm very thankful for ITV in believing me.' Other stars who are fronting This Morning this summer include Sian Welby, Dermot O'Leary, Emma Willis, Josie Gibson, Rochelle Humes, Joel Dommett, Craig Doyle, and Andi Peters. Recently Olivia hit out at the 'stigma' of being the partner of a successful sportsman, insisting she funds her own lavish lifestyle and has worked 'relentlessly' since being catapulted to fame when she left the Love Island villa in 2017. She became a bona fide WAG when she tied the knot with footballer Bradley Dack in a lavish central London ceremony in the summer of 2023. The TV personality dated Bradley, 31, prior to entering the ITV reality show and he was already a footballer playing for League Two team Gillingham FC. Olivia slammed 'gold digger' claims and said it doesn't matter what job her husband has because she works 'seven days a week'. She told MailOnline: 'I think people are like, ""She works seven days a week, surely she's got some f*****g cash"". 'Maybe in the beginning when Brad and I first started dating, there was a bit of a stigma around it [dating someone who plays sport for a living]. 'And people can kind of go, ""Oh"", a bit of an eye roll and stupid comments like, ""Oh my gosh she's with him cos he plays football"". 'I've got my own money, so it doesn't really matter what he does for a job.' Straight-talking Olivia shot to fame thanks to her stint in the Love Island villa in the summer of 2017, which saw her reach the show final with her ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes, 32, who she dated until February 2018. The former grid girl has since become a household name and a regular face on TV, appearing on The Only Way Is Essex, I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! , This Morning and Loose Women. Olivia has also fronted many of her own shows and presented Bad Boyfriends, Getting Filthy Rich and The Price Of Perfection - admitting she has 'bitten the hands off' TV executives for 'big jobs, little jobs, whatever I could get'. But this success did not come overnight and she told how she 'grafted' when she left the villa while working relentlessly to get where she is today. Olivia told MailOnline: 'Post Love Island, I knew where I wanted to be. I knew I wanted to stay working in television, and I was very dedicated to that, and everything I've done is working towards that bigger goal. 'I've been very patient and I've learnt the craft, I'm still learning, I've taken the big jobs, the little jobs, whatever I could get, I just bite their hand off for it.' 'Relentlessly pursuing that bigger goal and I'm working really hard at it, it doesn't come overnight', she added. 'Even when you get a big platform like Love Island, you still need to prove yourself to people. 'I think sometimes people become impatient off the back of reality shows, but these kind of things, they don't happen overnight, you have to stick with it. It takes graft.' Olivia has enjoyed the spoils of a lavish lifestyle thanks to her lucrative television career and is regularly seen toting around Chanel and Hermes handbags. She has also enjoyed many luxurious trips throughout the years - in the last nine weeks she has been seen in France, Miami and Ibiza. In her popular TV documentary, Price Of Perfection, Olivia was very candid about her own cosmetic tweakments and confessed she spends a 'couple of grand a month' maintaining her image.","Have YOU got a story?

Et pour cause : sollicitées de toutes parts pendant cette période festive faste, certaines personnalités sont toujours au rendez-vous du star system. C'était notamment le cas de l'actrice française Elsa Zylberstein qui assistait au défilé Chanel Haute Couture le 6 juillet dernier. Pour l'occasion, la belle brune de 56 ans — qui est également ambassadrice de la maison de mode — arborait une tenue dans l'air du temps. Et pour cause : vêtue d'un ensemble tailleur en cuir, elle osait le total look en toute décontraction.

Key trends expected during this period encompass the adoption of blockchain technology for dependable supply chain management and intellectual property protection, the consideration of artificial intelligence usage for projecting trending themes in patterns, colours, and styles, a focus on recycling and upcycling to minimize waste, harnessing the Internet of Things (IoT) for the development of more creative products, and the integration of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies into physical and online stores to enrich the shopping experience.

Since her breakout role as Isabel “Belly” Conklin in Amazon Prime's The Summer I Turned Pretty in 2022, the actor has gone from a fresh face to one of Hollywood's most promising young stars, both on and off the screen. In 2023, Coach tapped her for a campaign, and by 2024, she was making regular appearances at New York and Paris Fashion Week. As her star continues to rise, so does her red carpet confidence—Tung has embraced everything from ethereal Balmain gowns to flirty, sheer looks from cool girl labels like Rodarte and Sandy Liang. Below, take a look back at Tung's style evolution on the red carpet. 2025: The Summer I Turned Pretty Season 3 Premiere Michael Loccisano/ Entertainment/ Sheer Ann Demeulemeester, paired with a fringe headpiece and knee-high sneakers, was Tung's look for The Summer I Turned Pretty season three premiere. 2025: Chanel Tribeca Festival Artists Dinner Sean Zanni/WireImage/ The actor leaned into her dressier side for a 2025 Chanel dinner, wearing a glittery spaghetti strap look from the French label, paired with minimal accessories and satin heels. 2025: New York Fashion Week Dimitrios Kambouris/ Entertainment/ In 2025, Tung attended Tory Burch's New York Fashion Week show in a retro-meets-mod look that looked plucked from 1965. 2024: Paris Fashion Week WWD/WWD/ Tung meant business at Paris Fashion Week in 2024 when she wore a tongue-in-cheek Balmain dress that mimicked the look of a suit jacket. 2023: CFDA Awards WWD/WWD/ The actor, in an embellished Balmain dress with sculptural hips, offered an artful twist on the naked dress for the 2023 CFDA Awards. 2023: The Summer I Turned Pretty Season 2 Party Jamie McCarthy/ Entertainment/ To celebrate the premiere of The Summer I Turned Pretty season 2 in New York, Tung turned to the city's ultimate cool girl brand: Sandy Liang. 2023: Gold Gala Monica Schipper/ Entertainment/ The star's draped Bach Mai look was peak old Hollywood. 2023: Paris Fashion Week Pascal Le Segretain/ Entertainment/ The actor wasn't shy about standing out for her first time at Paris Fashion Week. Her dotted Balmain dress and croc-embossed accessories spoke for themselves. 2023: New York Fashion Week Rob Kim/ Entertainment/ Tung mixed aesthetics at NYFW in 2023, attending the Bach Mai presentation in a cut-out princess dress and high-top sneakers. 2022: The Summer I Turned Pretty Premiere Craig Barritt/ Entertainment/ For the season one premiere of The Summer I Turned Pretty, Tung kept it classic in a black plunge dress, clear shoes, and crimped hair that fell past her shoulders.","Whether she's wearing vintage-inspired lace or sleek, modern tailoring, Lola Tung is quickly becoming a new-gen style icon.

mov_EFB5FD23A27F30701E6EFB54ADEE84A3,"  This week's letter's premise is simple. Here are eight fashion people I wish would launch Substacks of their own. They all have exceptional taste, strong POVs, and almost certainly no time in their days to take on another social platform, but that's neither here nor there. And I'm not nominating them without providing any editorial direction. That would be rude! Instead, I'm pitching an angle, a sample letter, and even a secondhand pick because it is Long Live, after all. Long Live is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Please contribute your nominees in the comments + let's see who we can publicly peer pressure into launching a Substack, shall we? Paloma Elsesser  Supermodel, my Tiktok comfort creator    She's a mogul. An international supermodel. And one of my favorite people to follow on Tiktok . I think this level of reverence is how people felt about supermodels in the 90s. I just know she's even cooler IRL somehow, which is why I need her on Substack. palomija A post shared by @palomija  The pitch: BTS on the jet-set life of a vintage fashion-obsessed supermodel—from her drugstore skincare routine secrets to her latest haul from Front Street General Store. Sample letter: “Here's Every Single Paint Color We Used In My Brooklyn Home.” Secondhand pick: Paloma loves Comme, so these $261 shorts with tags on TRR are a total match made in heaven. Jenna Lyons  Godmother of J.Crew, the reason I wore red lipstick from 2013-2015  ditaeyewear A post shared by @ditaeyewear  Does she need an intro, dear Long Livers? I'm assuming “mother” might be an apt descriptor for Jenna Lyons when it comes to this group. Now that The Real Housewives shooting calendar is off the table, perhaps it's time for her to find her way to the page, er, computer screen? A moment of vulnerability from yours truly  The pitch: Jenna's little black book of the best tailors, the longest inseams, and fabulous breakdowns of her iconic looks. Sample letter: “The Exact Details I Ask For When Creating A Custom Button Down.” Secondhand pick: Let's keep it simple in a $65 J.Crew denim chore jacket . I'm sure she'll have an exceptional idea for what to wear on the bottom half. Christopher John Rogers  Designer, met at a Substack dinner so there's an actual chance here   CJR designs joy personified. There's a feeling in seeing one of his creations in person that's unmatched. Elegance! Fearlessness! Poise! And I'd like very much to see more of those three things here on Substack. christopherjohnrogers A post shared by @christopherjohnrogers  The pitch: A monthly letter-from-the-editor style missive, outlining recent collaborations, inspirations, and snapshots of CJR's coterie of excellent dressers. Sample letter: “August: Martinis with Tracee Ellis Ross at 11a”   Secondhand pick: If you want to score Christopher John Rogers on the secondhand market, you have to be quick. This maxi skirt is for us, since we can assume he has a closet bursting with perfectly custom pieces already. Sandy Liang  Designer, the reason you tie a ribbon on your purse   Whether the Baggu collab was your first exposure to her brilliance or not, Sandy Liang is a fashion world darling. And her taste certainly does not stop at the closet. sandyliang A post shared by @sandyliang  The pitch: Sandy on skincare! Sandy on the best dry cleaner downtown! Sandy on layering to winter-proof even your frilliest frocks! Sample letter: “How I Planned Two Weddings While Running Your Favorite Fashion Brand”   Secondhand pick: Not that she's in need of any more bows, but this $20 brooch struck me as something she might pin onto a dress.

Sample letter: “Creating An Unforgettable Met Look For Laura Harrier”  daniellegoldberg A post shared by @daniellegoldberg  Secondhand pick: Let's go with a sample from Calvin Klein 205w39nyc on eBay....","This week's letter's premise is simple. Here are eight fashion people I wish would launch Substacks of their own. They all have exceptional taste, strong POVs, and almost certainly no time in their days to take on another social platform, but that's neither here nor there. And I'm not nominating them without providing any editorial direction. That would be rude! Instead, I'm pitching an angle, a sample letter, and even a secondhand pick because it is Long Live, after all. Long Live is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber. Please contribute your nominees in the comments + let's see who we can publicly peer pressure into launching a Substack, shall we? Paloma Elsesser Supermodel, my Tiktok comfort creator She's a mogul. An international supermodel. And one of my favorite people to follow on Tiktok . I think this level of reverence is how people felt about supermodels in the 90s. I just know she's even cooler IRL somehow, which is why I need her on Substack. palomija A post shared by The pitch: BTS on the jet-set life of a vintage fashion-obsessed supermodel—from her drugstore skincare routine secrets to her latest haul from Front Street General Store. Sample letter: “Here's Every Single Paint Color We Used In My Brooklyn Home.” Secondhand pick: Paloma loves Comme, so these $261 shorts with tags on TRR are a total match made in heaven. Jenna Lyons Godmother of J.Crew, the reason I wore red lipstick from 2013-2015 ditaeyewear A post shared by Does she need an intro, dear Long Livers? I'm assuming “mother” might be an apt descriptor for Jenna Lyons when it comes to this group. Now that The Real Housewives shooting calendar is off the table, perhaps it's time for her to find her way to the page, er, computer screen? A moment of vulnerability from yours truly The pitch: Jenna's little black book of the best tailors, the longest inseams, and fabulous breakdowns of her iconic looks. Sample letter: “The Exact Details I Ask For When Creating A Custom Button Down.” Secondhand pick: Let's keep it simple in a $65 J.Crew denim chore jacket . I'm sure she'll have an exceptional idea for what to wear on the bottom half. Christopher John Rogers Designer, met at a Substack dinner so there's an actual chance here CJR designs joy personified. There's a feeling in seeing one of his creations in person that's unmatched. Elegance! Fearlessness! Poise! And I'd like very much to see more of those three things here on Substack. christopherjohnrogers A post shared by The pitch: A monthly letter-from-the-editor style missive, outlining recent collaborations, inspirations, and snapshots of CJR's coterie of excellent dressers. Sample letter: “August: Martinis with Tracee Ellis Ross at 11a” Secondhand pick: If you want to score Christopher John Rogers on the secondhand market, you have to be quick. This maxi skirt is for us, since we can assume he has a closet bursting with perfectly custom pieces already. Sandy Liang Designer, the reason you tie a ribbon on your purse Whether the Baggu collab was your first exposure to her brilliance or not, Sandy Liang is a fashion world darling. And her taste certainly does not stop at the closet. sandyliang A post shared by The pitch: Sandy on skincare! Sandy on the best dry cleaner downtown! Sandy on layering to winter-proof even your frilliest frocks! Sample letter: “How I Planned Two Weddings While Running Your Favorite Fashion Brand” Secondhand pick: Not that she's in need of any more bows, but this $20 brooch struck me as something she might pin onto a dress.

The Call Me Bae star recently went viral after revealing that her popular Labubu dolls are actually fake. In a light-hearted moment caught on camera, Ananya admitted that she ended up with knock-off Labubu toys, known as Lafufus and fans can't stop talking about it. The clip was shared by Ananya's close friend and social media personality Orry (Orhan Awatramani). In the video, Orry is seen pointing to a Labubu doll hanging from Ananya's designer Chanel bag and asking if it's real. Ananya replied honestly, “It is! But it's on a Chanel bag, so no one will ever know.” The 26-year-old then explained how she got the fake toys. “My friend Ridhima was trying to start a Labubu business and she ordered 100 of them, but ended up with Lafufus instead,” Ananya said with a laugh. Her candid reaction has been praised by fans, many of whom appreciated her honesty and sense of humour. Labubu Doll Trend In Celebrities Meanwhile, Labubu dolls have recently become a major trend, especially among young people and celebrities. These tiny, designer plush toys can be seen hanging off bags, backpacks, and even making appearances at global events. Khushi Kapoor was spotted showing her Labubu to her dad, filmmaker Boney Kapoor. In a funny twist, Boney introduced his own “life-sized Labubu” referring to Orry. Also actress Urvashi Rautela took her Labubu dolls all the way to Wimbledon. On the other hand, she was last seen in Kesari Chapter 2, a historical courtroom drama. The movie also featured Akshay Kumar and R Madhavan. The movie did significantly weel at the box office. Up next, she will be seen in Chaand Mera Dil, a romantic comedy opposite Kill actor Lakshya. She is also set to begin filming for Season 2 of her Amazon Prime Video series Call Me Bae.","Actress Ananya Panday is once again grabbing attention, but this time it's not for a movie role or a red carpet appearance.

Crossing Minds announced the transition on its website, calling it a ""new chapter"" and thanking its investors, partners, and internal team. According to TechCrunch, Crossing Minds had built a reputation for helping clients like Chanel, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU), Udacity, and Anthropic improve real-time personalization without compromising user privacy. Crossing Minds had previously been backed by Index Ventures, Shopify (NASDAQ:SHOP), Plug and Play, and Radical Ventures across multiple rounds of funding. Don't Miss: The startup developed technology that could understand long-term customer preferences using on-site behavioral data, avoiding the need to collect personal information, TechCrunch says. The Crossing Minds team said their work began with the core belief that understanding intent was the foundation for building powerful AI assistants. They didn't want to simply predict a user's next move, but to learn their long-term preferences and what made each individual unique. That principle guided the company through years of development, research, and product testing. The team said that their goal was to create systems that could work in real time with messy, complicated environments, not just clean lab data. Trending: Named a TIME Best Invention and Backed by 5,000+ Users, Kara's Air-to-Water Pod Cuts Plastic and Costs — And You Can Invest At Just $6.37/Share Crossing Minds is no longer accepting new business, according to its notice. It is unclear whether the company will continue to operate independently following the team's transition to OpenAI. The co-founders said they were motivated by a belief in OpenAI's mission and felt aligned with the company's broader purpose. ""Joining OpenAI allows us to bring our work — and our values — into a mission we deeply respect:  to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity,"" they wrote. They also credited their team with embodying values like integrity, empathy, and over-delivery, praising the group for their persistence through difficult engineering challenges. Alexandre Robicquet, one of the co-founders, has already updated his LinkedIn profile to reflect his new role at OpenAI in research, post-training, and AI agents. “After eight years of building Crossing Minds, today marks the start of a new chapter: our team is joining OpenAI,” Robicquet wrote in a LinkedIn post. “Personally, joining OpenAI's research team to focus on agents and information retrieval is a unique honor. These are precisely the problems I've always been passionate about: how systems learn, reason, and retrieve knowledge at scale, in real-time,” he added.

mov_1C4871C519B5DB2E8D81B8C63573CEE0,"  Olivia Jade Giannulli has begun a new chapter of her life in a brand-new city. The 25-year-old influencer and daughter of actor Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, posted a YouTube vlog Wednesday, where she started off by wishing her followers a “Good morning from Paris.” “This is going to be such a fun adventure to film and I'm here for a little while living,” she said. “So, I'm really excited to get some videos out for you guys. It's just going to be such an exciting, formative time.” Giannulli did not explain to her 1.8 million YouTube subscribers why she decided to move to an entirely new country, but did let them know what she's been up to as she walked to go grab coffee. She also talked about her experience in Paris thus far and the Paris Fashion Week events she attended. 'I'm living in Paris for a little while. That's the update,' the influencer said () 'I'm living in Paris for a little while. That's the update,' the influencer said () “I've just had a really crazy busy week since being in Paris,” she said. “I did the Patou show, the Chanel show, which was amazing. Then we took the train to London.” “Now I'm back home in Paris. I'm living in Paris for a little while. That's the update,” she added. Giannulli continued the vlog by teasing the rest of her Parisian adventures as she said, “A lot more fun, exciting change is also coming in the future, which I'm so excited to share with you guys. I'm hopefully launching my business at the end of this year. There's just a lot going on, and it's all really good and really exciting.” The move comes six years after her mother and father were among 33 wealthy parents who were charged with trying to rig the American college admissions system. They admitted to paying half a million dollars to guarantee their daughters – Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose Giannulli – admission to the University of Southern California (USC) under false pretenses. More in Celebrity In October 2020, Loughlin was sentenced to two months in prison, while the designer was sentenced to five months. In addition to the prison sentence, Loughlin was ordered to pay a $150,000 fine and perform 100 hours of community service. Under his own plea deal, Loughlin's husband was ordered to pay a $250,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service. Months later, Giannulli broke her silence about the college admissions scandal during an appearance on Red Table Talk. “I think that what hasn't been super public is that there is no justifying or excusing what happened,” she said during the episode, which aired in December 2020. “Because what happened was wrong.” Since then, Giannulli has joked about the scandal on her YouTube channel, telling her followers last year that she was looking forward to her kitchen “not feeling like a prison.” Giannulli went on to acknowledge how viewers would mock her for the prison reference, with jokes about her parents' college admission scandal. “Save the jokes,” she said. “Don't want to hear it. I set you up, and I don't want you to tee off, okay?”","Olivia Jade Giannulli has begun a new chapter of her life in a brand-new city.

While we can't justify her exact pick (a mere $10,800), we can totally score this  that channels luxury for less. Clearly a friend of the brand, Cruz at the Chanel Haute Couture FW 25/26 show in Paris on July 8. Looking like the definition of luxury, the movie star wore a head-to-toe Chanel look that consisted of a tweed suit from the 2026 resort collection, cat-eye sunglasses and a gold bracelet. She finished off the ensemble with red nails and a voluminous blow-out. The look's crème de la crème was her classic quilted Chanel bag, and it's everything we want to carry on our shoulder this season. Thankfully, Amazon came through with — and its thousands less. Get the for just at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, July 17, 2025, but are subject to change. The is proof you don't have to take out a loan to get a designer-looking bag — you simply have to know where to shop. Like Cruz's style, it features that classic Chanel flap-over design, quilted exterior, chain strap and shiny gold hardware. It's made entirely of PU leather, so it can stand up to years of wear and tear. Plus, it can transition into a crossbody as well. At just the perfect size, the purse can fit almost everything you'd need for a day out on the town, including a wallet, sunglasses, phone and makeup for touchups. In addition to the black option, you can shop the bag in several stunning colors from classic camel to pretty mint green. We bet they'll have you running back for more. Shoppers are starting to catch on to the sparkle of this bag, with over 200 people buying it in the last month. Reviewers rave that it “looks just like” the more expensive version “that is way more money.” They also love the functionality of it since the bag has “enough room to fit essentials in and [is] not heavy to carry,” per the shopper. Whether you're heading to the office or the airport for a getaway, you'll want to have in tow. It's the pick that dresses up any look, but still can mix and match with several vibes.

Another massive fail for Lauryn as she's ended up *even more* blacklisted than she already was. Of course none of us printed her story. What a girl's girl. |Lauryn Goodman was all smiles as she stepped out in the sunshine for a wholesome family day at London Zoo celebrating Kinara's 2^(nd) birthday, proving once again that love and laughter with her children are the perfect antidote to online negativity. The proud mum-of-two was spotted enjoying the popular attraction with son Kairo and daughter Kiki, soaking up the summer sun and focusing on what matters most — family. The outing comes after ongoing pressure from online trolls, including cruel commentary from gossip forums like Tattle Life. But Lauryn is choosing to stay positive and focus on her children, continuing to rise above the noise with strength. Looking effortlessly stylish, Lauryn wore a white and blue ensemble inspired by trending TikTok Shop finds, paired with classic Zara sandals and a timeless Chanel boy bag — the perfect blend of affordable chic and designer flair. Kairo looked cool and confident in Dolce & Gabbana shorts teamed with a simple white Zara tee and comfy Crocs, while little Kinara melted hearts in a sweet pink mini skirt and a delicate Ted Baker top, matching her mum's sense of summery style. Lauryn, who has spoken openly about the challenges of being in the public eye, is keen to show a more grounded and authentic side of her life — one where normality, and motherhood take centre stage. “Nothing matters more to me than my kids,” Lauryn says. “Spending time with them, just doing everyday things, keeps me grounded and reminds me what's real.” The family were seen laughing, pointing at animals, and enjoying ice cream under the sun — a true reminder that happiness can still thrive even in the face of public scrutiny.

The younger brother of Warriors five-eighth Chanel Harris-Tavita, Calvin has been touted as the ""next Benji Marshall"" due to his side-step and ability to carve up opposition defences. The 17-year-old is still based in Auckland and has played both league and union. He attends the prestigious Kings' College and was recently promoted to the school's first XV in rugby. But he's just as good at league and was recently named in the team of the tournament at the Under-17s ANZRL competition. News Corp is reporting that Brisbane have signed the younger Harris-Tavita brother and given him a spot in their academy. And photos on the 17-year-old's Instagram account show him training in Broncos gear last month. It's a huge signing coup for Michael Maguire and the Brisbane Broncos. (AAP Image/Darren England) Huge raps on 'next Benji Marshall' Speaking back in 2023, the chairman of New Zealand Maori rugby league spoke glowingly of what kind of career Harris-Tavita will have. One of the most respected voices in Kiwi rugby league, John Devonshire likened Harris-Tavita to a young Marshall. “He is the next Benji Marshall to be honest,” Devonshire told News Corp. “He is that good. I haven't seen someone as exciting as he is for many, many years. Especially as a seven (halfback).” Calvin Harris-Tavita (second from left) is the younger brother of Warriors star Chanel (far right). Image: Calvin Harris-Tavita/Getty Devonshire was a talent scout for the Warriors in the 1990s, and made a staggering call on how good Harris-Tavita can be. When asked how he rates the youngster's side-step compared to Benji's, he said: “Better. And not being disrespectful to Benji, but he tackled better too.” Tellingly, Devonshire predicted the Warriors would have a fight on their hands to sign Harris-Tavita. But he thought it would be rugby union - not another NRL club - who would poach him. “The lure of the All Black jersey is always there,"" he said. "" Over here the school system is about two out of 10 for rugby league. But the family will do what is right for him. He has still got his education and we have to think about that as well. But he should write his ticket now. There will be agents lining up for him.” Calvin Harris-Tavita eyeing NRL debut with Broncos Calvin's older brother Chanel is having a brilliant season for the Warriors, helping them sit fourth on the NRL ladder after 19 rounds. The five-eighth stepped up last week in the first game without halves partner Luke Metcalf, who is gone for the rest of the season with an ACL injury. RELATED: As for Calvin, he might not have to wait too long to get a taste of NRL level at the Broncos. Michael Maguire's team have Adam Reynolds and Ben Hunt on their books for one more season in 2026, but they're both 35 and won't be around for too much longer. Five-eighth Ezra Mam is only 22, while 19-year-old Coby Black is being touted as the club's halfback of the future. But if Harris-Tavita impresses the right people while making his way through the ranks, he might have something to say about that.","Michael Maguire and the Broncos have reportedly snared a young gun with huge raps. ·Sports Editor Link copied The Brisbane Broncos have reportedly signed talented youngster Calvin Harris-Tavita from under the noses of NRL rivals the New Zealand Warriors - and rugby union.

Photos I. F. Trois choses qu'il faut savoir sur Alain Place. À soixante-neuf ans, ce ""faux retraité"" a le business chevillé au corps – selon ses proches, c'est ""un bourreau de travail"" –, il entreprend toujours en famille, alors qu'humilité et succès vont de pair dans tous ses projets. ""Vous avez devant vous quelqu'un qui a conduit des autocars pendant quatorze ans, de 1976 à 1990. Ces années passées sur les routes, ça laisse du temps pour méditer"", plante l'ex-patron et héritier de l'entreprise familiale Place mobilité, fondée à Trith-Saint-Léger (près de Valenciennes) il y a soixante-huit ans, devenue un acteur majeur du transport dans les Hauts-de-France. Le chapitre de la mobilité Une success story bâtie ex nihilo, dans le berceau de la sidérurgie nordiste. ""Mon père, Auguste Place, était ajusteur outilleur chez Usinor (leader européen de la sidérurgie jusqu'à la fermeture des hauts fourneaux de Denain, en 1988, Ndlr). Il enchaînait les petits boulots après ses huit heures d'usine. En avril 1957, il a acheté un petit car et ouvert le chapitre familial de la mobilité que j'ai développé en diversifiant l'activité: ajout d'une prestation au transport avec le tourisme en autocar, dans les années 1990 développement des voyages en avions et bateaux via notre filiale Place Voyages (cédée en 2023), puis au tournant des années 2000, le transport scolaire qui a conforté notre croissance exponentielle"", retrace Alain Place. En avril 2025, ce Chti devenu vigneron à partir de 2012, au domaine de l'Heure Bleue à Gonfaron (lire par ailleurs), a définitivement fermé le chapitre de la mobilité, en cédant les clés de sa société à l'autocariste français Transarc. Au moment de la cession: 450 salariés, 340 autocars, 15.000 scolaires transportés par jour grâce à quatre délégations de service public dans les Hauts-de-France. Autant dire, un bolide lancé sur le segment des opérateurs indépendants du transport interurbain. Réal d'Or, le challenge du néovigneron ""Il n'y avait pas de volonté de reprise chez mes quatre filles, elles font toutes des métiers sympas"", clarifie l'homme d'affaires, tout à son nouveau projet dans la plaine des Maures. Avec le rachat, le 9 octobre, des 67 hectares du château Réal d'Or (pour un montant non communiqué), un nouveau chantier s'ouvre à l'appétit de l'entrepreneur. ""Il y a des fantasmes financiers sur cette session - nous sommes tenus à des clauses de confidentialité par les vendeurs. C'est un achat raisonnable, parce qu'on a repris des bâtiments performants, un vignoble en production, mais l'activité commerciale était à relancer complètement"", assure le néovigneron. Ses nouveaux bureaux regardent vers les 27 hectares de vignes qu'il vient de convertir en bio. Des quelques cartons encore à déballer, Alain Place sort une collection de maquettes, des autocars, des bateaux, un avion Boeing 747, un morceau de parquet à l'effigie du club de basket de Denain Voltaire qu'il a présidé (de 1995 à 2003) et relancé (de 2013 à 2019). Son bureau pourtant, n'a rien d'une chambre d'enfant! Chez Alain Place, le business est toujours en embuscade. ll faut, dans les prochaines semaines, finaliser les travaux du caveau de vente qui rouvrira en juillet, conforter les ventes des vins sur le segment CHR (cavistes, hôtels, restaurants), ""développer notre présence dans le grand Sud, les Hauts-de-France et en Belgique qui sont notre premier marché pour les vins de l'Heure Bleue"", étaye l'investisseur, bien décidé à mutualiser les productions de ses deux domaines varois. ""J'ai très vite compris qu'il y avait ici un outil de production remarquable, ça a allumé une double lumière en moi: celle de la diversification vers l'hébergement et l'œnotourisme, celle de la mutualisation des outils de production. Avec les dix hectares de l'Heure Bleue, la rentabilité est impossible pour des gens comme moi. À la différence d'un vigneron qui s'occupe de tout, je n'ai pas coché les cases pour monter sur le tracteur"", reconnaît le nouveau patron de Réal d'Or, dont le rôle sera ""davantage d'être dans l'accompagnement"". ""C'est un fonceur"" Son entourage le dit prudent, méticuleux, très perfectionniste, ""mais paradoxalement c'est un fonceur"", nuance sa fille, Alice. Au château Réal d'Or, Alain Place a foncé, mais conservé les équipes en place, la maître de chai Murielle Schlicklin, l'œnologue-conseil Jérôme Paquette. Un modèle de management dont il escompte un certain succès. ""J'ai appris à m'entourer de gens plus forts et plus compétents que moi dans leurs spécificités"", assure-t-il. Fidèle à sa culture entrepreneuriale, Alain Place ouvre en famille, le nouveau chapitre de la diversification provençale avec sa fille Alice, revenue développer l'hébergement et l'œnotourisme, après un premier parcours professionnel: école de commerce, Institut Français de la Mode (IFM) en section marketing développement et produit, dix ans d'expérience dans le secteur du luxe, en accessoire et joaillerie (pour Hermès, Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Bulgari, etc.), là aussi un bolide. ""L'idée ici, c'est de faire du beau, de sublimer l'endroit, en proposant dix chambres dans une nature dominante"", commente la jeune femme, alignée sur les mêmes valeurs que son père. ""Tous les blocs sont réunis, le bloc vin, le bloc famille, le bloc transmission"", lui fait écho ce dernier. Méticulosité et précision, on ne refait pas Alain Place! L'aventure de l'Heure Bleue ""Une maison dans le Midi, des amis pour la vie"", plaisante volontiers Alain Place. C'est en venant visiter à Gonfaron des connaissances du Nord, fascinées comme eux par la lumière du Sud, qu'Alain et son épouse Brigitte Place sont devenus vignerons, en 2012. ""On a eu un coup de cœur pour l'endroit qu'on a racheté, à 300mètres d'altitude au pied de Notre-Dame-des-Anges. Il y avait deux solutions, soit on prenait un fermage et nos raisins partaient à la coopérative, soit on faisait du vin. Le côté entrepreneur a repris le dessus"", explique Alain Place. Le vignoble de 10 hectares, entièrement restructuré, est converti en bio dès 2016. Les vins rosés et blancs jusqu'à présent vinifiés chez Jean-Pierre Daziano (domaine de la Fouquette), intégreront la cuverie de château Réal d'Or dès la vendange 2025.

Ces années passées sur les routes, ça laisse du temps pour méditer"", plante l'ex-patron et héritier de l'entreprise familiale Place mobilité, fondée à Trith-Saint-Léger (près de Valenciennes) il y a soixante-huit ans, devenue un acteur majeur du transport dans les Hauts-de-France. Le chapitre de la mobilité Une success story bâtie ex nihilo, dans le berceau de la sidérurgie nordiste. ""Mon père, Auguste Place, était ajusteur outilleur chez Usinor (leader européen de la sidérurgie jusqu'à la fermeture des hauts fourneaux de Denain, en 1988, Ndlr). Il enchaînait les petits boulots après ses huit heures d'usine. En avril 1957, il a acheté un petit car et ouvert le chapitre familial de la mobilité que j'ai développé en diversifiant l'activité: ajout d'une prestation au transport avec le tourisme en autocar, dans les années 1990 développement des voyages en avions et bateaux via notre filiale Place Voyages (cédée en 2023), puis au tournant des années 2000, le transport scolaire qui a conforté notre croissance exponentielle"", retrace Alain Place. En avril 2025, ce Chti devenu vigneron à partir de 2012, au domaine de l'Heure Bleue à Gonfaron (lire par ailleurs), a définitivement fermé le chapitre de la mobilité, en cédant les clés de sa société à l'autocariste français Transarc. Au moment de la cession: 450 salariés, 340 autocars, 15.000 scolaires transportés par jour grâce à quatre délégations de service public dans les Hauts-de-France. Autant dire, un bolide lancé sur le segment des opérateurs indépendants du transport interurbain. Réal d'Or, le challenge du néovigneron ""Il n'y avait pas de volonté de reprise chez mes quatre filles, elles font toutes des métiers sympas"", clarifie l'homme d'affaires, tout à son nouveau projet dans la plaine des Maures. Avec le rachat, le 9 octobre, des 67 hectares du château Réal d'Or (pour un montant non communiqué), un nouveau chantier s'ouvre à l'appétit de l'entrepreneur. ""Il y a des fantasmes financiers sur cette session - nous sommes tenus à des clauses de confidentialité par les vendeurs. C'est un achat raisonnable, parce qu'on a repris des bâtiments performants, un vignoble en production, mais l'activité commerciale était à relancer complètement"", assure le néovigneron. Ses nouveaux bureaux regardent vers les 27 hectares de vignes qu'il vient de convertir en bio. Des quelques cartons encore à déballer, Alain Place sort une collection de maquettes, des autocars, des bateaux, un avion Boeing 747, un morceau de parquet à l'effigie du club de basket de Denain Voltaire qu'il a présidé (de 1995 à 2003) et relancé (de 2013 à 2019). Son bureau pourtant, n'a rien d'une chambre d'enfant! Chez Alain Place, le business est toujours en embuscade. ll faut, dans les prochaines semaines, finaliser les travaux du caveau de vente qui rouvrira en juillet, conforter les ventes des vins sur le segment CHR (cavistes, hôtels, restaurants), ""développer notre présence dans le grand Sud, les Hauts-de-France et en Belgique qui sont notre premier marché pour les vins de l'Heure Bleue"", étaye l'investisseur, bien décidé à mutualiser les productions de ses deux domaines varois. ""J'ai très vite compris qu'il y avait ici un outil de production remarquable, ça a allumé une double lumière en moi: celle de la diversification vers l'hébergement et l'œnotourisme, celle de la mutualisation des outils de production. Avec les dix hectares de l'Heure Bleue, la rentabilité est impossible pour des gens comme moi. À la différence d'un vigneron qui s'occupe de tout, je n'ai pas coché les cases pour monter sur le tracteur"", reconnaît le nouveau patron de Réal d'Or, dont le rôle sera ""davantage d'être dans l'accompagnement"". ""C'est un fonceur"" Son entourage le dit prudent, méticuleux, très perfectionniste, ""mais paradoxalement c'est un fonceur"", nuance sa fille, Alice. Au château Réal d'Or, Alain Place a foncé, mais conservé les équipes en place, la maître de chai Murielle Schlicklin, l'œnologue-conseil Jérôme Paquette. Un modèle de management dont il escompte un certain succès. ""J'ai appris à m'entourer de gens plus forts et plus compétents que moi dans leurs spécificités"", assure-t-il. Fidèle à sa culture entrepreneuriale, Alain Place ouvre en famille, le nouveau chapitre de la diversification provençale avec sa fille Alice, revenue développer l'hébergement et l'œnotourisme, après un premier parcours professionnel: école de commerce, Institut Français de la Mode (IFM) en section marketing développement et produit, dix ans d'expérience dans le secteur du luxe, en accessoire et joaillerie (pour Hermès, Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Bulgari, etc.), là aussi un bolide. ""L'idée ici, c'est de faire du beau, de sublimer l'endroit, en proposant dix chambres dans une nature dominante"", commente la jeune femme, alignée sur les mêmes valeurs que son père. ""Tous les blocs sont réunis, le bloc vin, le bloc famille, le bloc transmission"", lui fait écho ce dernier. Méticulosité et précision, on ne refait pas Alain Place! L'aventure de l'Heure Bleue ""Une maison dans le Midi, des amis pour la vie"", plaisante volontiers Alain Place. C'est en venant visiter à Gonfaron des connaissances du Nord, fascinées comme eux par la lumière du Sud, qu'Alain et son épouse Brigitte Place sont devenus vignerons, en 2012. ""On a eu un coup de cœur pour l'endroit qu'on a racheté, à 300mètres d'altitude au pied de Notre-Dame-des-Anges. Il y avait deux solutions, soit on prenait un fermage et nos raisins partaient à la coopérative, soit on faisait du vin. Le côté entrepreneur a repris le dessus"", explique Alain Place. Le vignoble de 10 hectares, entièrement restructuré, est converti en bio dès 2016. Les vins rosés et blancs jusqu'à présent vinifiés chez Jean-Pierre Daziano (domaine de la Fouquette), intégreront la cuverie de château Réal d'Or dès la vendange 2025.

Una perfecta excusa para viajar a este país y descubrir por qué las presentaciones de colecciones son como son hoy en día. El verano es la mejor temporada para visitar museos: ¡cuantos más, mejor! Seguro que ya tienes fichadas algunas galerías o centros culturales para tus vacaciones. A esa lista deberías sumar esta exposición sobre desfiles de moda que acabamos de descubrir. Aunque se inaugura el 18 de octubre y tendrá lugar en el Vitra Design Museum, en Alemania, merece la pena reservar unos días para ir. La muestra recorre la historia del desfile de moda, desde sus inicios en 1900 hasta la actualidad. Arriba: Imagen de desfile de Chanel en 2017. Crédito: Helmut Fricke / Abajo: Fotografía en blanco y negro de un desfile de Rabanne. Crédito: Alain Loison La exposición se titula “Catwalk: The Art of the Fashion Show” y reúne imágenes, piezas originales, escenografía, documentos y otros elementos que revelan el detrás de escena de los desfiles de moda. ¿Tienes las vacaciones en septiembre y aún no sabes qué hacer? Es normal: hay mucha oferta, pero también ganas de hacer algo diferente que no sea solo playa o montaña. Nuestra propuesta: una escapada cultural al Vitra Design Museum, en Alemania. Allí se presentará una exposición que te encantará —y que podría valer como un máster intensivo—. Nos referimos a la esperada muestra Catwalk: The Art of the Fashion Show, dedicada al mundo de los desfiles de moda. Quizá ya la hayas visto anunciada en redes sociales. Esta exposición ofrece un recorrido histórico único que te ayudará a entender por qué los desfiles actuales son como son, y cuál es su papel en la narrativa y la identidad de una marca. Desde los primeros shows en 1900 hasta las presentaciones más actuales, verás imágenes, documentos y ejemplos de casas como Balenciaga, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Helmut Lang, Martin Margiela o Prada. Y como sabemos que te gusta llevar los deberes hechos, estate atento: te contaremos más detalles para que llegues con la lección aprendida. Desfile de Dries van Noten. Crédito: Helmut Fricke.

Childhood friends Callum (Noah Valentine making an impressive professional stage debut) and Sephy (Corinna Brown) meet in secret by a secluded beach. Sephy is the daughter of a politician (Habib Nasib Nader) and Callum's mother (Kate Kordel) used to be their family's housekeeper. The teenagers live in a sharply divided world. White people, like Callum, are Noughts, treated with barely concealed contempt by the ruling black population, known as Crosses. Through this clever inversion, Blackman explores racism, terrorism and prejudice, challenging prevailing social inequalities. When Callum wins a scholarship to Sephy's prestigious Cross school, she hopes it will bring them closer. But he faces hostility from his classmates and Sephy's attempt to befriend the Noughts is met with violence. As both their home situations deteriorate, their forbidden love story becomes increasingly fraught. Callum's family has a history of resistance. His brother Jude (an excellent Alec Boaden) is a member of the Liberation Militia, an underground rebel group. After the suicide of his sister Lynette (Chanel Waddock), Callum saves Sephy from a shopping mall bombing, but is persuaded to join the militia with tragic consequences for their relationship. Dominic Cooke's faithful adaptation prioritises Blackman's central themes, while Tinuke Craig's bold production leaves little room for nuance – a combination that sometimes leaves the actors grappling with one-dimensional characters. Although integral to the story, the graphic aftermath of the bomb attack and the visceral representation of an execution make for uncomfortable viewing, particularly given the 20th anniversary of 7/7. Still, Blackman's story strikes a powerful chord. The cast's energy is infectious and Colin Richmond's school-prison set, together with Joshua Pharo's atmospheric lighting, adds to the overall sense of menace. Suitable for ages 14+.

Sephy is the daughter of a politician (Habib Nasib Nader) and Callum's mother (Kate Kordel) used to be their family's housekeeper. The teenagers live in a sharply divided world. White people, like Callum, are Noughts, treated with barely concealed contempt by the ruling black population, known as Crosses. Through this clever inversion, Blackman explores racism, terrorism and prejudice, challenging prevailing social inequalities. When Callum wins a scholarship to Sephy's prestigious Cross school, she hopes it will bring them closer. But he faces hostility from his classmates and Sephy's attempt to befriend the Noughts is met with violence. As both their home situations deteriorate, their forbidden love story becomes increasingly fraught. Callum's family has a history of resistance. His brother Jude (an excellent Alec Boaden) is a member of the Liberation Militia, an underground rebel group. After the suicide of his sister Lynette (Chanel Waddock), Callum saves Sephy from a shopping mall bombing, but is persuaded to join the militia with tragic consequences for their relationship. Dominic Cooke's faithful adaptation prioritises Blackman's central themes, while Tinuke Craig's bold production leaves little room for nuance – a combination that sometimes leaves the actors grappling with one-dimensional characters.

Until July 26 openairtheatre.com","Chanel Waddock and Noah Valentine in Noughts & Crosses [Manuel Harlan] MALORIE Blackman's acclaimed 2001 young adult novel, Noughts & Crosses, is a dystopian tale with echoes of Romeo and Juliet. Childhood friends Callum (Noah Valentine making an impressive professional stage debut) and Sephy (Corinna Brown) meet in secret by a secluded beach. Sephy is the daughter of a politician (Habib Nasib Nader) and Callum's mother (Kate Kordel) used to be their family's housekeeper. The teenagers live in a sharply divided world.

mov_F5D0EB995D0BB245DA42CE09E49CF886,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Lorsque Hailey Bieber mise sur une teinte, le monde de la mode suit. Cette saison encore, l'influenceuse impose son rythme avec une couleur inattendue qu'elle affiche subtilement, par petites touches, dans ses dernières apparitions. Ongles, accessoires, détails de maquillage… Tout semble indiquer que cette nuance bien précise s'apprête à teinter l'été 2025. Une couleur qui intrigue et s'impose déjà auprès des initiées. Rien d'étonnant quand on sait que la moindre tendance validée par Hailey Bieber finit souvent par coloniser les feeds Instagram avant de s'imposer dans les rayons des grandes enseignes. Jaune butter out, lemontini in : Hailey Bieber retourne la tendance Le butter yellow avait pourtant tout pour durer : pastel, flatteur et largement adopté sur les podiums de Chanel à Miu Miu, il s'était imposé comme la couleur du moment, embrassant vestes en toile, robes minimalistes et soies délicates. La mode semblait avoir trouvé dans cette nuance beurre une nouvelle base neutre pour l'été. Mais c'était sans compter sur l'intervention d'Hailey Bieber, qui, en une simple story Instagram, a signé la fin de règne du jaune doux. ""Le butter yellow est dépassé... respectueusement"", a-t-elle tranché, balayant la tendance d'un revers de main parfaitement manucurée. Depuis, un nouveau jaune s'impose en douce : plus franc, plus vif, presque citronné, il s'écarte du pastel pour injecter une touche acidulée dans le vestiaire estival. Baptisée lemontini, cette nuance plus affirmée s'annonce comme la couleur à suivre. Une prise de position qui bouscule les moodboards des stylistes et replace Hailey Bieber en arbitre redoutée des tendances. Jaune lemontini : la couleur qui électrise l'été 2025 Il fallait s'y attendre. Le jaune citron, longtemps resté en marge des podiums, signe son grand retour sous un nom un peu plus branché : lemontini. Une nuance fraîche et lumineuse, directement inspirée des étés méditerranéens, qui n'a rien d'une nouveauté mais que la mode redécouvre grâce à un coup de pouce inattendu. Jacquemus, Genny et quelques autres avaient amorcé le mouvement, glissant ici et là des touches de jaune acide dans leurs collections. Mais c'est Hailey Bieber qui, une fois encore, a transformé la tendance discrète en phénomène global. La fondatrice de Rhode a en effet joué la carte du jaune flashy pour rhabiller son célèbre baume à lèvres, lancé en édition spéciale sous le nom ""Lemontini"". Résultat : un simple tube citronné est devenu le nouvel accessoire fétiche des it-girls, qui s'affichent désormais toutes baume à la main, de Romee Strijd à Alexandra Saint Mleux. Derrière le succès de cette nuance ? Une stratégie marketing aussi millimétrée qu'efficace, qui a propulsé le jaune lemontini au rang de couleur de l'été, reléguant sans ménagement le butter yellow au rayon des tendances déjà vues. Le jaune lemontini passe du dressing à la trousse beauté Mais la mode ne s'arrête pas là. Le lemontini s'invite désormais dans les routines beauté. Hailey Bieber elle-même l'a adopté jusqu'au bout des ongles, optant pour une ""dot manicure"" minimaliste où le jaune vif sert de toile de fond. Sur les paupières, les make-up artists s'amusent à revisiter les aplats 80's façon citron pressé, tandis que les lèvres prennent une teinte légèrement dorée ou acidulée selon les marques. Le jaune lemontini ne se porte plus seulement sur les vêtements, il devient un véritable statement beauty. Pas étonnant, donc, que la sphère mode s'empresse de suivre. Avec son allure solaire mais plus tranchée que le pastel, le jaune lemontini promet d'apporter une dose d'énergie aux looks estivaux, tout en s'imposant comme un choix moins attendu que les habituels pastels de saison. Plus vif, plus moderne, ce jaune citron s'impose sur les robes en lin, les accessoires, et jusqu'aux détails de maquillage, devenant la touche acidulée indispensable de l'été 2025. Et, une fois de plus, c'est Hailey Bieber qui, en associant instinct mode et marketing redoutable, signe le coup d'envoi.","SPR_COMBO[fr]Lorsque Hailey Bieber mise sur une teinte, le monde de la mode suit.

Le jaune citron, longtemps resté en marge des podiums, signe son grand retour sous un nom un peu plus branché : lemontini. Une nuance fraîche et lumineuse, directement inspirée des étés méditerranéens, qui n'a rien d'une nouveauté mais que la mode redécouvre grâce à un coup de pouce inattendu. Jacquemus, Genny et quelques autres avaient amorcé le mouvement, glissant ici et là des touches de jaune acide dans leurs collections. Mais c'est Hailey Bieber qui, une fois encore, a transformé la tendance discrète en phénomène global. La fondatrice de Rhode a en effet joué la carte du jaune flashy pour rhabiller son célèbre baume à lèvres, lancé en édition spéciale sous le nom ""Lemontini"". Résultat : un simple tube citronné est devenu le nouvel accessoire fétiche des it-girls, qui s'affichent désormais toutes baume à la main, de Romee Strijd à Alexandra Saint Mleux. Derrière le succès de cette nuance ? Une stratégie marketing aussi millimétrée qu'efficace, qui a propulsé le jaune lemontini au rang de couleur de l'été, reléguant sans ménagement le butter yellow au rayon des tendances déjà vues. Le jaune lemontini passe du dressing à la trousse beauté Mais la mode ne s'arrête pas là. Le lemontini s'invite désormais dans les routines beauté. Hailey Bieber elle-même l'a adopté jusqu'au bout des ongles, optant pour une ""dot manicure"" minimaliste où le jaune vif sert de toile de fond. Sur les paupières, les make-up artists s'amusent à revisiter les aplats 80's façon citron pressé, tandis que les lèvres prennent une teinte légèrement dorée ou acidulée selon les marques. Le jaune lemontini ne se porte plus seulement sur les vêtements, il devient un véritable statement beauty. Pas étonnant, donc, que la sphère mode s'empresse de suivre. Avec son allure solaire mais plus tranchée que le pastel, le jaune lemontini promet d'apporter une dose d'énergie aux looks estivaux, tout en s'imposant comme un choix moins attendu que les habituels pastels de saison. Plus vif, plus moderne, ce jaune citron s'impose sur les robes en lin, les accessoires, et jusqu'aux détails de maquillage, devenant la touche acidulée indispensable de l'été 2025. Et, une fois de plus, c'est Hailey Bieber qui, en associant instinct mode et marketing redoutable, signe le coup d'envoi.",2025-07-18 17:00:54,fr,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The text is primarily about a fashion trend involving a ""lemontini"" yellow color, with a brief mention of Chanel in the context of fashion shows (podiums).

It's like I'd rather smell this on my Uber driver than live with it myself. 3.) Wearing really niche perfumes that smell like dank shit to most people defeats one big aspect of wearing fragrance. Yes you should buy fragrance that makes you happy first and foremost but I really do think some people should consider how it completes their presentation to the world. Doing twenty sprays of something that smells like festering dog semen & patchouli because it's niche and YOU like it doesn't mean people are going to like it too.

Retelling the sweet story during a Q&A at a special screening of her documentary, My Mom Jayne, at the HamptonsFilm's SummerDocs series on Thursday, July 17, Hargitay said the way Hermann, her husband of more than 20 years, handled the piano reveal made her think the worst. It was her first day filming for the documentary in Los Angeles when Hermann called her and told her, ""There's an Uber outside. I need you to get in the car.""

""So now I'm starting to get scared,"" she said of how she felt at the time. Hargitay said the car took her down the 405 freeway in Los Angeles, making her think she was headed to Los Angeles International Airport. After passing that landmark, they took another freeway and started heading into an area Hargitay wasn't familiar with — and that's when she began to think the worst. ""I'm sure that my husband's gonna have me whacked,"" she remembered thinking, to which the audience erupted in laughter. ""I'm so scared. I was like, 'I did nothing but be a perfect wife!'""

The soft, creamy shade was all over the runway and our FYPs. Since then, it's evolved into lemon yellow, or ""limoncello,"" thanks to Hailey Bieber. She recently released a new version of her viral Peptide Lip Tint in Lemontini ($16). Since then, people have been opting for this brighter, more saturated shade of yellow and incorporating it into their beauty routines in myriad ways. It's officially a limoncello summer. One of the best ways to incorporate the limoncello trend into your beauty routine is via a clean, crisp manicure. At least that's what celebs seem to think. Bieber recently showed off a lemon-yellow manicure on Instagram while promoting her new lip product. Meanwhile, Kourtney Kardashian posted an Instagram story showing off her sunny French manicure. Even Charlize Theron is sporting yellow nails, having recently made an appearance in NYC wearing a cool, crescent-shaped design. So, yeah, it's safe to say that celebs are giving this juicy summer nail trend their stamp of approval. Keep scrolling for inspo and product picks. Hailey Bieber's ""lemon drop manicure"" is so chic. It's difficult to see in this picture, but it features a base of sunny yellow nail polish overlaid with gray polka dots. (ICYMI, polka dots are another major summer nail trend.) If you want to try your hand at re-creating it, here's the tutorial from her nail artist, Zola Ganzorigt. Kourtney Kardashian posted this picture to her Instagram Story, tagging nail artist Lisa Kon. She calls it a ""butter yellow"" manicure. To me, though, ""butter yellow"" and ""limoncello"" reference the same, albeit evolved, trend: a spotlight on yellow!

mov_FDE63C53B12A8239271B6155114F9976,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Cơn bão Threads tuần qua về Hà Trúc như một buổi họp tổ dân phố online. Người kể chuyện, người thêm thắt, người từng gặp, người từng bị block. Một bó hoa cưới, một vài story chụp lại thái độ “pick-me-girl”, một vài trải nghiệm bị cho là “thiếu chuyên nghiệp”. Vậy là hình ảnh về một “ngọc nữ” của giới KOLs trở nên tan tành, để lại chân dung một cô gái tìm mọi cách để xây dựng một hình ảnh hoàn hảo, dù cho đôi khi cái áo cô tự khoác lên mình có vẻ hơi kệch cỡm. Và thế là đủ để một nhân vật từng truyền cảm hứng cho rất nhiều cô gái trẻ trở thành đối tượng cho một cuộc giễu cợt online không hồi kết. Nhưng nếu nhìn kỹ, ta sẽ thấy điều kỳ lạ: Hà Trúc không phạm một sai lầm đạo đức rõ ràng, không lừa dối ai lấy tiền, không gieo độc khán giả bằng những ý tưởng lệch lạc. Cô ấy chỉ… “gồng” quá lâu, và nhiều khi - theo những câu chuyện kể lại từ cư dân mạng - cũng cư xử không tốt với những người xung quanh, đặc biệt là khách hàng. Và câu hỏi đặt ra là: Liệu tất cả những điều đó có đáng để khiến Lê Hà Trúc bị nhấn chìm hoàn toàn? Lê Hà Trúc có thật sự “gây hại”? Chúng ta đang nói về một người phụ nữ dậy sớm, mặc đẹp, làm việc để tự lo cho bản thân và gia đình, có những ước mơ và dần thực hiện những ước mơ của mình, không quên dặn người khác “hãy sống tích cực”. Vậy mà bằng một cách nào đó, chính hình ảnh ấy lại trở thành mục tiêu công kích của hàng loạt người lạ - những người cho rằng cô đang “sống giả”, “gồng quá”, “kiểm soát hình ảnh thái quá”. Ok, gồng quá thì cũng đáng ghét thật, nhưng sống gồng có phải là một tội không? Trong tất cả những gì Hà Trúc chia sẻ, không có dấu hiệu nào của sự lan truyền lệch chuẩn đạo đức. Cô không cổ vũ thù ghét, không tôn thờ tiêu cực, không nhân danh tổn thương để đổ lỗi cho thế giới. Những gì cô làm - dù có “kịch bản hóa” đến đâu - cũng chỉ là kể về một cuộc sống ngăn nắp, đẹp đẽ, đầy gu và chủ động. Nếu có vấn đề, thì vấn đề lớn nhất là: cô ấy “quá đẹp” để ai đó tin nó đẹp 100%. Nhưng nếu sự “khó tin” đó không làm tổn hại ai, thì vì sao chúng ta lại giận dữ đến thế? Giả sử bạn thấy một người giả tạo, bạn hoàn toàn có thể unfollow, block, lướt qua. Mạng xã hội không ai ép ta phải xem, phải tin, hay phải đồng tình. Nhưng khi ta chủ động ở lại, moi móc, phân tích từng câu chữ, từng cử chỉ, rồi nói rằng: “Tôi không chịu nổi vì cô ấy giả tạo quá” - thì người thực sự cần soi lại, có khi không chỉ là Hà Trúc. Có thể cô ấy đang ""diễn"", nhưng đó là sân khấu cô chọn. Khán giả có quyền không mua vé, nhưng không thể vì không thích vai diễn ấy mà kéo cả sân khấu sập xuống rồi nói rằng: ""Vì cô khiến tôi thấy khó chịu, nên cô sai."" Vậy câu hỏi cần đặt ra là: Từ bao giờ thể hiện mình sống đẹp cũng trở thành tội lỗi? Cảm giác xa cách không đến từ váy vóc hay nhà đẹp. Nó đến từ sự lệch pha trong thái độ: một người phụ nữ quá mải mê với cái đẹp của mình, với ly nước buổi sáng, với mái tóc uốn đúng nếp và ánh đèn đúng tông - đến mức có vẻ như không còn thực sự nhìn thấy ai khác. Mọi story đều bắt đầu bằng “mình thấy...”, “mình chọn...”, “mình biết ơn...”, và ít khi còn chừa chỗ cho một đối thoại thực sự với người đọc. Hình ảnh Hà Trúc, theo thời gian, không còn là tấm gương để soi vào - mà là một khung tranh được đóng kín, không cho ai bước vào cùng. Khi một nhân vật công chúng vừa chia sẻ cuộc sống xa xỉ, vừa nói bằng một giọng điệu có phần cao ngạo, người xem rất dễ cảm thấy mình bị đặt thấp hơn. Và cảm giác bị “ở dưới” một ai đó chính là thứ khó chịu nhất. Không ai muốn bị dạy dỗ về sự “biết ơn mỗi ngày” từ một người vừa khoe túi hiệu, vừa đăng caption “cái đẹp bắt đầu từ bên trong” trong khi bên ngoài thì đang quá chỉn chu đến mức xa rời thực tế. Nó khiến người đọc cảm thấy bị dẫn dắt vào một cuộc chơi mà họ không đủ tiền để mua vé. Sự “mắc mệt” của Hà Trúc - những chi tiết nhỏ như bó hoa cưới, thái độ trên phân khi chia sẻ về đồ hiệu và đồ bình dân (dù người mua cũng phải bỏ tiền triệu để sở hữu) hay phản ứng thái quá với lời chê - trở thành cú nổ cuối cùng. Nó không còn là chuyện của một người, mà là phản chiếu của rất nhiều người từng im lặng nhìn theo. Và khi họ nhận ra rằng cô cũng có khuyết điểm, cũng sai, cũng có thể nói quá, cũng có thể làm lố, thì có một cảm giác trỗi dậy: Cuối cùng thì cô ấy cũng giống chúng tôi, vậy tại sao lại phải gồng lên ra vẻ hơn chúng tôi? Nỗ lực của Hà Trúc có đáng bị phủ định sạch trơn? Ở một góc nhìn khác, có thể nói: Hà Trúc là người làm nghề rất nghiêm túc. Dù hình ảnh mà cô theo đuổi có thể không còn hợp số đông, thì không thể phủ nhận cô đã và đang làm đúng những gì một influencer chuyên nghiệp cần làm - thậm chí làm ở mức độ cao hơn bình thường: Tạo dựng một thế giới thẩm mỹ nhất quán, duy trì hình ảnh thương hiệu cá nhân xuyên suốt, và khiến người ta nhớ đến mình không lẫn đi đâu được trong hàng vạn người mặc váy trắng xách túi Chanel. Trong thế giới mạng xã hội, ai cũng có thể trở thành “người có ảnh hưởng” nếu sở hữu một chút visual, một ít caption cảm hứng và vài hợp đồng quảng cáo. Nhưng không phải ai cũng làm được cái điều Hà Trúc đã làm: Xây dựng và duy trì một thế giới quan thẩm mỹ nhất quán suốt gần một thập kỷ. Điều đó không đến từ cảm hứng vu vơ, mà đến từ một sự kiểm soát cực kỳ chi tiết - và sự tự ý thức cao độ về hình ảnh. Từ tone màu, ánh sáng, chữ ghi chú “handwritten style”, cách đặt máy ảnh… tất cả đều cho thấy một người phụ nữ tự đạo diễn lấy cuộc sống mình theo một kịch bản đã định. Điều đó có thể khiến người ta cảm thấy xa lạ, nhưng cũng đồng thời là bằng chứng cho thấy: đây là một “content creator” đúng nghĩa - người không chỉ chia sẻ cuộc sống, mà còn sản xuất hình dung về cái đẹp. Việc bị đánh giá là “khó làm việc” không tự động biến một người thành người xấu. Trong ngành nghề sáng tạo, rất nhiều người thành công là những người từng bị gắn mác “khó chịu”, “kiểm soát”, “kỹ tính quá mức” - từ stylist, đạo diễn, cho tới KOLs. Nếu một influencer xuất hiện trước công chúng 365 ngày/năm, mỗi hình ảnh đều đại diện cho cả thương hiệu cá nhân lẫn uy tín thương mại với các brand, thì việc kiểm soát là điều bắt buộc. Hà Trúc không làm những content ngẫu hứng. Cô làm chiến dịch. Và như bất kỳ một giám đốc sáng tạo nào, cô có toàn quyền định hình hình ảnh của chính mình - kể cả khi điều đó khiến người khác thấy không thoải mái. Các brand lựa chọn tiếp tục hợp tác với cô là minh chứng rằng: sự “khó” đó tạo ra giá trị. Một chiến dịch đẹp, bài đăng chuẩn chỉnh, tone thương hiệu khớp với thẩm mỹ tổng thể - đó là điều mà bất kỳ marketer nào cũng mơ....","SPR_COMBO[vi]Cơn bão Threads tuần qua về Hà Trúc như một buổi họp tổ dân phố online.

urn:li:share:7352684138874728448,"  How are your customers' trust patterns dependent on your brand color choices? Why is tech always blue, finance obsessed with green, and food/retail addicted to red, orange, and yellow? This isn't just design. It's color psychology meeting consumer trust patterns. And every industry leans into it, intentionally. Let's break it down: → Tech = Blue Blue signals intelligence, trust, and calm. It creates a sense of security, perfect for companies managing your data, identity, or future. Brands like IBM, Intel Corporation, Meta, and LinkedIn all use it to say: “We're stable. You're safe.” → Finance = Green Green connects to money, growth, and reassurance. It's both literal and emotional, invoking prosperity, steadiness, and renewal. Used by companies like Fidelity Investments, TD, and Mint to subtly reinforce financial well-being. → Retail & Food = Red Red drives action. It increases appetite, creates urgency, and attracts immediate attention. Fast food, retail sales, and entertainment brands? Red is everywhere. Think The Coca-Cola Company, Netflix, Target, McDonald's. → Luxury = Black Black is power. Sophistication. Timeless elegance. It doesn't beg for attention, it commands it. Luxury brands like CHANEL, Prada Group, and Rolls-Royce use it to say: “This isn't for everyone.” → Wellness & Beauty = Soft pinks, beige, and muted tones These colors evoke a sense of calm, warmth, and subtlety. They encourage trust and emotional ease, key for skincare, wellness, and beauty brands. Glossier, Inc., Savage X Fenty, and Aesop are all built on these soft signals. → Sustainability & Ethical Brands = Earthy greens and browns These hues reflect nature, purity, and authenticity. They communicate grounded values and ethical responsibility. Think Patagonia, The Honest Company, Whole Foods Market. → Crypto, Web3, AI = Purple, gradients, futuristic tones Purple signals imagination, innovation, and depth. Often mixed with neon gradients, it positions brands as next-gen, visionary, and untethered from tradition. Brands like OpenAI, Discord, and Avalanche heavily lean in this direction. Color isn't decoration. It's a strategy. It's psychology. It's positioning. It's the first thing your audience feels, before they read a single word. If your brand's colors are chosen by “what looks cool,” instead of “what builds belief,” You may already be misunderstood. Color isn't just about standing out, it's about fitting in, where it matters most.

The Freaky Friday 2 star served major Barbiecore energy in a dreamy outfit that included a sorbet pink tweed Chanel bag. We've been swooning over the bag ever since, so we had to track down this to copy the look. Earlier this spring, Lohan looking like she just walked out of a Polly Pocket summer dream. Her look? A lavender mini dress, pink oval Celine sunglasses, clear PVC Chanel heels, Anita Ko gold statement earrings and a tweed Chanel bag. Her designer pick is almost impossible to find (and afford), but thankfully, this isn't. Get the for just at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication but are subject to change. Channeling Chanel's signature preppy charm, this bag is made with a structured silhouette, a tweed fabric and luxe gold hardware. It has a chic chain strap to cleverly doubles as both a shoulder bag and a crossbody. It comes in a bright sorbet-pink tweed-like fabric (perfect for cute summer looks), along with two color-infused shades: white and black. From hair clips and lip gloss to compact mirrors and mini perfumes, this bag is roomy enough to fit all of your everyday must-have's. However, it's still compact enough to stay sleek and lightweight. With no inner pockets, you're free to organize the interior how you see fit. This luxe bag elevates your everyday style, whether you're wearing a flowy sundress or office-approved trousers. For brunch, you can pair it with a ruffled mini dress and kittens heels or with a crisp button-down and your go-to denim for drinks with the girls. Whether you're reviving Y2K style or simply want to add a pop of pink that feels luxurious for summer, this nails it. It has the same playfully pink energy Lohan brought to her look — just without the five-figure price tag. No A-list budget required for this find, you can pick it up for just $28 on Amazon.

""They're delighted,” Rihanna said of the baby on the way. “I've always wanted a girl. But God knows best, right? And I love my boys.” A source told PEOPLE earlier this month that Rihanna and Rocky are ""thrilled"" to become parents to a third child, adding that they've ""really embraced this chapter and their bond has only deepened since becoming parents.""

Hastings gave away a penalty when he appeared to leave early while trying to charge down a field-goal attempt from Tanah Boyd in the dying stages of the Warriors' 20-15 victory. With the Knights leading 15-14, Boyd sprayed his attempt to level the score at 15-15 and missed. But the Warriors challenged the call in what appeared to be complete desperation. The Warriors felt Hastings might have contacted Boyd's legs - or the ball - which would have been a penalty or line drop-out either way. Andrew Johns stayed silent as referee Grant Atkins explained to Newcastle captain Dane Gagai why the Bunker official gave the Warriors a penalty. Image: Getty/Channel 9 But the Bunker official found that Hastings wasn't square at marker when he raced out to pressure Boyd's kick. The Warriors were awarded a penalty, and even though Boyd missed the ensuing shot at goal, they still got the ball back in prime field position. The Knights managed to block another field-goal attempt from Boyd, but the ensuing ricochet went straight to Leka Halasima, who raced away to score a stunning try for the win. Even though Boyd missed the penalty goal, Knights fans were still fuming because it meant the Warriors had possession from the ensuing 20m drop-out. Jackson Hastings didn't look square, but Chanel Harris-Tavita also walked off the mark. Image: Channel 9 Knights fans fume over Jackson Hastings penalty Many felt Hastings was hard done-by because Chanel Harris-Tavita walked off the mark when he played the ball - making it appear as though Hastings wasn't square. However the crucial replays seemed to show the Knights player was only slightly to the side of the ruck - but enough to break the rules. Speaking in commentary for Channel 9, Phil Gould said it was ""terrible"" for the Knights. And Newcastle legend Johns had a very telling reaction.

mov_2B9B7A85FC20F32BFF32228A2AB64ED3,"  Zepto co-founder Aadit Palicha last week announced the 10-minute delivery for luxury cosmetic brands-- Estée Lauder's M.A.C., The Ordinary and Clinique--on the platform. From discounted offerings to previously elusive luxury and global brands, e-commerce and quick commerce platforms are witnessing a multifold surge in beauty and skincare product sales amid soaring demand. In fact, capitalizing on this trend, Zepto co-founder Aadit Palicha last week announced the 10-minute delivery for luxury cosmetic brands-- Estée Lauder's M.A.C., The Ordinary and Clinique--on the platform. After observing a surge in demand for existing beauty brands like Maybelline, Lakmé, and Faces Canada, Mamaearth, Renee, Swiss Beauty, and SUGAR Cosmetics, Zepto decided to expand its portfolio by including luxury brands as well, to offer users a wider range of options, said Devendra Meel, Chief Business Officer at Zepto. According to a report by Bengaluru-based consultancy firm Redseer, India's beauty industry is expected to reach $34 billion by 2028, driven by rising disposable incomes, increased consumer aspirations, and the influence of social media and e-commerce. Highlighting changing consumer behaviour, Amazon Beauty, Director Siddharth Bhagat told Storyboard18 about a strong shift towards tech-enabled, trend-led and personalised experiences for the cosmetics and skincare products. He said that faster deliveries, influencer-driven discovery, and the rise of D2C and international brands are further fueling the momentum. ""Amazon has witnessed a 12x growth in cosmetics due to the recent success of newly launched brands in 2025,"" Bhagat added. Nykaa, the pioneer in building a beauty-centric digital commerce platform, said its beauty business has grown 25 percent on a year-on-year basis, recording a revenue of Rs 7,251 crore for fiscal year 2025. Nykaa's beauty vertical includes e-commerce, physical retail, its house of brands, as well as an eB2B business. Nykaa's closest competitor, Myntra, has also ramped up its beauty segment on the platform to capitalise on the demand. Deepak Joshi, Senior Director - Category Management, Beauty and Personal Care, Myntra said the platform's dedicated 'Beauty' segment has outpaced the online beauty market by two-fold, registering more than 50 percent consistent year-on-year increase in monthly active users. ""Currently, Myntra Beauty boasts more than 2,900 brands,"" Joshi added. 'Tier-2 demand surge' Industry experts have acknowledged that tier-2 cities have emerged as a crucial market for platforms, driving demand for both affordable and premium cosmetics and skincare products. Meel from Zepto said that while quick commerce has largely remained metro-centric, traction for beauty products has notably increased in Tier-2 cities as well. Myntra's Joshi also noted that nearly half of the beauty buyers on the platform come from tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Besides, He also mentioned that Myntra's quick commerce service, M-Now, witnessed a 1.4x spike in demand for beauty products on Mother's Day in 2025. Notably, Vishal Chaturvedi, Vice President, The Body Shop, Asia South, said that quick commerce has delivered exceptional results for the company, almost doubling its growth compared to last year. ""Our specially curated selection of packed gift boxes and mini packs has seen strong sales on the quick commerce platform,"" Chaturvedi said. 'Rise of K-Beauty' In the competitive beauty market, digital commerce platforms have expanded their portfolio by adding luxury and premium beauty offerings, particularly Korean beauty (K-beauty) brands. According to the Amazon spokesperson, the K-Beauty category on the platform has witnessed a 75 percent year-on-year growth. According to Bhagat, K-beauty products primarily resonates with urban and digital-savvy women, aged between 20 and 35 years. ""The urban women have embraced K-beauty products to a larger extent, especially from cities like Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Pune"". Moreover, women from tier-2 cities are also exploring the K-beauty products through trial SKUs like sheet masks and minis, he added. Bucking the trend, Bhagat said Amazon has observed that a rising cohort of male consumers are also experimenting with Korean skincare, particularly around functional solutions like cleansers, serums, and sunscreens. A range of K-beauty brands have entered into Indian market via digital commerce platforms, such as COSRX, Laneige, and Beauty of Joseon, TIRTIR, Medicube, and Skin1004. Meanwhile, Myntra said that they have witnessed a 150 percent YoY growth in K-beauty category. Beyond K-beauty, several international luxury beauty brands are also capturing Indian consumers' attention through digital channels. Nykaa has a dedicated segment, called Nykaa Luxe, which offers a wide range of cosmetics and skincare products from luxury brands such as Armani beauty, Chanel, L'Oréal Luxe, Eucerin, Dior, Tom Ford, sol de janerio, among others. The company noted that the average annual spend by its top 10% customers is $395 on premium beauty products. Following suit, other platforms like Tira and Tata CliQ have also expanded their beauty portfolios. Myntra's quick commerce venture also offers a selection of international and premium beauty brands, including YSL and Estee Lauder. A report by global consultancy firm Kearney underscored that the luxury beauty accounts for about 4 percent share of the overall beauty and personal care market. In contrast, developing Asian peers, such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia, see luxury beauty holding a 20-25 market share. However, when it comes luxury beauty market, offline stores have outpace online platforms, according to Kearney. The firm said that 70 percent of luxury beauty sales came from the offline channel in the past year. ""Specialty stores, with beauty-focused multi-brand retailers such as Sephora and Nykaa, contribute to 25 percent of the luxury beauty market, followed by boutiques or standalone brand stores, such as MAC, Forest Essentials, and Dior, with 20 percent of the market,"" the report added.","Zepto co-founder Aadit Palicha last week announced the 10-minute delivery for luxury cosmetic brands-- Estée Lauder's M.A.C., The Ordinary and Clinique--on the platform.
