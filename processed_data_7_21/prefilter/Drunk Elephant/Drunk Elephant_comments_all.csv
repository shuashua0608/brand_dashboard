1m1lhgm,"  Hi there, I discovered this subreddit today and thought it might be the right place to tell my story and ask for advice. Sorry it's gonna be long. It's been several months now that I feel what I think is limerence for someone and I don't know how to get out of it. I don't even know if I want to get out of it actually, but it has a growing impact on my mental health that scares me. I am also engaged with a girl who is not that person and we are about to get married in weeks. At the end of last year, my manager decided to leave the company I work for. I had been in there for a year and little by little we realized we had things in common, especially we love the same band. Also she really defended me when another manager harassed me and said to me in a vocal message I should jump out of a window. That's when we started to get closer together. Then came her farewell party, we got a bit drunk but not that much. I got alone with her and asked her what was her favorite song of our band. We realized the had the same song. I am seeing that band live soon so I told her she should check her phone on that day because I'd call her. That's the moment she jumps into my arms and tells me she's gonna miss me so much, that she loves me, that we're gonna see each other again, that she's still going to be here for me. Kisses my neck though. My heart skipped a beat. If an elephant walked into the room, I wouldn't have noticed it. Suddenly she wasn't my manager anymore, but someone I had strong feelings for. I am an idiot for not trying to kiss her that day. But she's also with someone who was in the adjacent room during that moment. And she's older than me, like 10 years older. Plus there was kind of still a relationship of authority at that moment. We then started talking a lot by message, telling each other about our days and stuff, reacting on any story we posted. It became, to me at least, a ritual and having a notification of her started to be my shot of dopamine. It started to feel like love for me, more than friendship. We saw each other again, started to talk more about our personal lives, our past too. It felt like we have a bond together. I was thinking about telling her my feelings, I was about to do it. And then she got pregnant. Since then I obviously did not tell her. But we still talk almost everyday, we see each other like twice a month, I feel alive each time and then the days after, I feel really down. We like to surprise each other, give presents and stuff. She knows my relationship with my fiancée isn't going really well though. The thing is, I am thinking about that girl every minute of my life now. If we don't talk for a day, I am depressed. I wonder what she does, I post stories waiting for her reaction, I wonder if she thinks about me all the time. I adjust my schedule all the time just to see her. What she thinks about anything I do or like is more important than what I even personally think. I fantasize about what could have happen if I kissed her, or if we met earlier in our lives. When we don't see each other for two weeks I miss her like it's been years. I don't know what to do but I really don't want to cut her off. I want her to stay in my life. I love her from the bottom of my heart. And I am pretty sure nothing will ever happen now. I am scared of spending my life with the wrong person and that I can't do anything about it. Yesterday night I thought about jumping out of that window. I am seeing a psychologist though. I just want your thoughts and advice.","Hi there, I discovered this subreddit today and thought it might be the right place to tell my story and ask for advice. Sorry it's gonna be long.

作者| tt 
想了解全球化妆品行业发生了什么？ 本周(2025年7月14日—7月18日)全球资讯第366期，将聚焦联合利华入局AI、品牌入驻丝芙兰进行市场扩张、雅诗兰黛开设新职位并任命首位首席数字和营销官等内容展开。 雅诗兰黛新设职位迎变！ 又一家韩妆公司启动清算！ 裁员行列再添一位巨头！ 联合利华全方位入局AI！ 丝芙兰成品牌扩张跳板？ 香水领域再 “上新”
2025年已过半，在全球化妆品产业中，国际美妆企业们在应对全球经济不确定下挑战不断。 与此同时，为了提高营销和效率，AI是企业们绕不开的一个话题。 另外，从区域市场来看，东南亚仍然被国际美妆企业看好，欧莱雅和联合利华先后任命了印度高层，以期寻求新增长。 雅诗兰黛新设职位迎变！ 7月16日，雅诗兰黛官网宣布任命 Aude Gandon为首席数字和营销官。 该任命自2025年8月1日起生效。 值得注意的是，此职位为雅诗兰黛首次设立。 同时，Aude Gandon将直接向总裁兼首席执行官Stéphane de La Faverie汇报工作，并加入公司的执行团队。 △图源：雅诗兰黛官网 
据悉，Aude Gandon拥有全球视野和营销专业知识，未来她将领导公司数字、营销和媒体生态系统的转型，定制品牌组合战略，并将监督全球数字商务。 她的任命反映了雅诗兰黛致力于发展以消费者为中心的方法，并加强以营销为商业增长引擎的承诺。 △图源：雅诗兰黛官网 
Stéphane de La Faverie评价道：“Aude是一位杰出且成就斐然的全球营销领导者，在面向消费者的主要业务方面拥有丰富的经验。” Aude Gandon的早期职业生涯包括在Publicis Worldwide、McCann和Leo Burnett等全球广告公司担任高级职务，且与欧莱雅、宝洁美妆和LVMH在内的世界级美容和奢侈品客户均有合作。 在加入雅诗兰黛之前，Aude Gandon还在雀巢担任全球首席营销官，领导公司在188个市场和2000多个品牌进行数字化转型。 同时，她还实施了新的运营模式，推出了许多全球内容工作室，包括Google、Meta、Amazon和Netflix在内的主要技术平台建立了战略合作伙伴关系。 对于此次加入雅诗兰黛，Aude Gandon表示：“我期待与雅诗兰黛的团队合作，以增强我们的数字能力，加深消费者联系，并推动跨品牌和渠道的增长。” 又一家韩妆公司启动清算！ 7月15日，据韩网newsis报道，LG生活与健康护理(以下简称：LG)清算了其基因分析子公司“Mizen Story”。 △图源：newsis 
公开信息显示，LG和Macrogen于2016年12月合资60亿韩元(人民币约3096万元)成立了Mizen Story，双方持股比例各为 50%。 此后，LG分别于2019年3月和6月两次收购了剩余全部股权，将 Mizen Story 转变为旗下的全资子公司。 据了解，Mizen Story可以提供分析个人皮肤和头发基因的服务，并在此基础上提供定制的化妆品和健康功能食品。 虽然当时存在需求缺口，但是由于资金和人力等实际原因，Mizen Story并没有进入正轨。 此后，该公司在业绩方面也表现不佳。 当Mizen Story成为LG子公司时，它的销售额为0韩元，但运营赤字达到了13.12亿韩元(人民币约676.99万元)。 到2024年，其销售额仅为3300万韩元(人民币约17.03万元)，但赤字达到8.63亿韩元(人民币约445.31万元)。 尽管运营赤字并不大，但其母公司LG也可能已经被其影响。 对此，LG的一位官员表示：“我们认为基因检测服务是有限的，并决定清算它。” 裁员行列再添一位巨头！ 业绩的下滑不仅影响公司的业务发展，还会波及到企业员工的就业问题。 7月17日，据WWD报道，资生堂美洲也开始裁员。 值得注意的是，此次裁员资生堂并未给出具体人数。 △图源：WWD 
资生堂在一份声明中表示：“资生堂美洲已经进行了业务转型，以恢复增长和盈利能力。 作为这一过程的一部分，我们做出了取消公司内部某些职位的艰难决定，我们感谢离职的同事们对资生堂美洲的贡献，我们将为这些员工提供过渡支持。” 此外，资生堂临时首席执行官Alberto Noé也表示：“如今，资生堂美洲在多个方面都面临着深刻的挑战。 尽管我们尽了最大努力，但到2024年，资生堂业务表现已大幅下降，2025年的前景仍然黯淡。” 美洲市场的裁员或许也与资生堂的业绩相关。 其在5月发布的第一季度业绩中透露，美洲市场有19%的降幅，主要系Drunk Elephant销售额降幅超过60%。 “高通胀和经济不确定性给全球美容市场带来更广泛挑战。 各种因素导致了裁员的决定。 裁员将影响多个业务、职能和地点的许多员工。” Alberto Noé补充道。 值得注意的是，此次裁员信息是在Instagram帐户@esteelaundry首次发布的一份内部备忘录中所披露的。 联合利华全方位入局AI！...",SPR_COMBO[zh] 本周，联合利华入局AI、露华浓推出新香水、雅诗兰黛迎来首位首席数字和营销官、资生堂美洲裁员。 来源| 聚美丽 作者| tt 想了解全球化妆品行业发生了什么？ 本周(2025年7月14日—7月18日)全球资讯第366期，将聚焦联合利华入局AI、品牌入驻丝芙兰进行市场扩张、雅诗兰黛开设新职位并任命首位首席数字和营销官等内容展开。 雅诗兰黛新设职位迎变！ 又一家韩妆公司启动清算！ 裁员行列再添一位巨头！ 联合利华全方位入局AI！ 丝芙兰成品牌扩张跳板？ 香水领域再 “上新” 2025年已过半，在全球化妆品产业中，国际美妆企业们在应对全球经济不确定下挑战不断。 与此同时，为了提高营销和效率，AI是企业们绕不开的一个话题。 另外，从区域市场来看，东南亚仍然被国际美妆企业看好，欧莱雅和联合利华先后任命了印度高层，以期寻求新增长。 雅诗兰黛新设职位迎变！ 7月16日，雅诗兰黛官网宣布任命 Aude Gandon为首席数字和营销官。 该任命自2025年8月1日起生效。 值得注意的是，此职位为雅诗兰黛首次设立。 同时，Aude Gandon将直接向总裁兼首席执行官Stéphane de La Faverie汇报工作，并加入公司的执行团队。 △图源：雅诗兰黛官网 据悉，Aude Gandon拥有全球视野和营销专业知识，未来她将领导公司数字、营销和媒体生态系统的转型，定制品牌组合战略，并将监督全球数字商务。 她的任命反映了雅诗兰黛致力于发展以消费者为中心的方法，并加强以营销为商业增长引擎的承诺。 △图源：雅诗兰黛官网 Stéphane de La Faverie评价道：“Aude是一位杰出且成就斐然的全球营销领导者，在面向消费者的主要业务方面拥有丰富的经验。” Aude Gandon的早期职业生涯包括在Publicis Worldwide、McCann和Leo Burnett等全球广告公司担任高级职务，且与欧莱雅、宝洁美妆和LVMH在内的世界级美容和奢侈品客户均有合作。 在加入雅诗兰黛之前，Aude Gandon还在雀巢担任全球首席营销官，领导公司在188个市场和2000多个品牌进行数字化转型。 同时，她还实施了新的运营模式，推出了许多全球内容工作室，包括Google、Meta、Amazon和Netflix在内的主要技术平台建立了战略合作伙伴关系。 对于此次加入雅诗兰黛，Aude Gandon表示：“我期待与雅诗兰黛的团队合作，以增强我们的数字能力，加深消费者联系，并推动跨品牌和渠道的增长。” 又一家韩妆公司启动清算！ 7月15日，据韩网newsis报道，LG生活与健康护理(以下简称：LG)清算了其基因分析子公司“Mizen Story”。 △图源：newsis 公开信息显示，LG和Macrogen于2016年12月合资60亿韩元(人民币约3096万元)成立了Mizen Story，双方持股比例各为 50%。 此后，LG分别于2019年3月和6月两次收购了剩余全部股权，将 Mizen Story 转变为旗下的全资子公司。 据了解，Mizen Story可以提供分析个人皮肤和头发基因的服务，并在此基础上提供定制的化妆品和健康功能食品。 虽然当时存在需求缺口，但是由于资金和人力等实际原因，Mizen Story并没有进入正轨。 此后，该公司在业绩方面也表现不佳。 当Mizen Story成为LG子公司时，它的销售额为0韩元，但运营赤字达到了13.12亿韩元(人民币约676.99万元)。 到2024年，其销售额仅为3300万韩元(人民币约17.03万元)，但赤字达到8.63亿韩元(人民币约445.31万元)。 尽管运营赤字并不大，但其母公司LG也可能已经被其影响。 对此，LG的一位官员表示：“我们认为基因检测服务是有限的，并决定清算它。” 裁员行列再添一位巨头！ 业绩的下滑不仅影响公司的业务发展，还会波及到企业员工的就业问题。 7月17日，据WWD报道，资生堂美洲也开始裁员。 值得注意的是，此次裁员资生堂并未给出具体人数。 △图源：WWD 资生堂在一份声明中表示：“资生堂美洲已经进行了业务转型，以恢复增长和盈利能力。 作为这一过程的一部分，我们做出了取消公司内部某些职位的艰难决定，我们感谢离职的同事们对资生堂美洲的贡献，我们将为这些员工提供过渡支持。” 此外，资生堂临时首席执行官Alberto Noé也表示：“如今，资生堂美洲在多个方面都面临着深刻的挑战。 尽管我们尽了最大努力，但到2024年，资生堂业务表现已大幅下降，2025年的前景仍然黯淡。” 美洲市场的裁员或许也与资生堂的业绩相关。 其在5月发布的第一季度业绩中透露，美洲市场有19%的降幅，主要系Drunk Elephant销售额降幅超过60%。 “高通胀和经济不确定性给全球美容市场带来更广泛挑战。 各种因素导致了裁员的决定。 裁员将影响多个业务、职能和地点的许多员工。” Alberto Noé补充道。 值得注意的是，此次裁员信息是在Instagram帐户。 联合利华全方位入局AI！...,2025-07-19 11:05:25,zh,WEB,,esteelaundry首次发布的一份内部备忘录中所披露的,,,1,False,True,"The comment contains a specific mention of Drunk Elephant in the context of Shiseido's financial performance, noting a significant sales decline (over 60%) in the Americas market.

UgyYWkIO-X1DhcV7XVp4AaABAg,"  Hey kass I've been a subscriber for a pretty long time and I think my favorite labubu would've have to be dada. I know a lot of people think it's creepy but I think the eyes are just adorable. I think a really fun idea for a video could be titled something like this, “SIBLING UNBOXING BATTLE: TikTok Mystery Boxes! 💥📦” Each sibling gets a TikTok-inspired mystery box filled with random viral items (trending products, weird Amazon finds, aesthetic gadgets, slime, mini waffle makers, LED glasses, etc.). They take turns unboxing and scoring each other's items on a scale of “TikTok Hype Level.” The twist? They don't just open it — they have to use or try the item on the spot… no matter how ridiculous it is. Round 1: The Aesthetic Item •Each sibling unboxes one cute/fun viral item (like a mini sunset lamp, cloud projector, kawaii stationery). •They have 30 seconds to make a mini TikTok with it. •Other siblings rate it: “Would this go viral? Y/N?” Round 2: The Weird Amazon Find •Think: magnetic slime, fidget toys, voice-changer mic, fake bugs, or something oddly specific. •Try to guess what it is before opening. •If you guess wrong, the others get to prank you with the item. Round 3: The Mini Challenge Item •Box includes a trending TikTok game or product (e.g., TikTok jelly fruit, tiny kitchen, spinning wheel of dares). •Everyone has to participate in a mini challenge with it. •Last sibling to finish the challenge gets a sticker labeled “TikTok Fail” on their forehead. Final Round: The Viral Clone •Each sibling pulls out one random viral product knock-off (e.g., fake Stanley cup, mini ring light, faux Drunk Elephant dupe). •Try it out, give an honest (and funny) review. •End by voting whose box was most “TikTok-worthy.” And a twist you could add could be, Add a “Secret Item” planted by a parent or older sibling — something cringey from childhood (a baby photo, old toy, embarrassing drawing) hidden inside the TikTok fun. This adds humor and surprise. This is why it works: •Combines unboxing, competition, chaos, trends — everything TikTok loves. •Encourages reactions, duets, and stitching. •Perfect for multiple videos — each box = one TikTok. I think this might just be one of my best idea yet. I really hope to win this, but if I don't good luck to everyone else. ❤❤","Hey kass I've been a subscriber for a pretty long time and I think my favorite labubu would've have to be dada.
