1E5CC5E6F41CB49B75088E3749C263A1,"  Since returning to public life after cancer treatment last year, Catherine, Princess of Wales, has thrown herself back into her royal duties - showcasing an array of stellar outfits in the process. Her summer style has been a masterclass in on-trend elegance, and she's relied on the dresses, hats, shoes and jewellery already in her wardrobe. Yet the 43-year-old's look has subtly changed in other ways.

mov_BAABFC754377580B79B5BCA2D755EF30,"  Rihanna put an elegant twist on lingerie styling and added exaggerated proportions to her Saint Laurent look for the premiere of the animated film “Smurfs” in Los Angeles on Sunday. The Savage x Fenty founder attended the premiere alongside her sons, three-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and two-year-old Riot Rose Mayers, both of whom wore Dior Men suits. Rihanna was wearing a look from Saint Laurent's fall 2025 ready-to-wear collection, which debuted during Paris Fashion Week last March. The Grammy Award-winning artist's attire featured a black dress with lacy, lingerie-inspired detailing at the bust. The lace detailing transitioned into a silky smooth fabric. The look featured a drop-waist element to accentuate the singer's baby bump, which she debuted at the 2025 Met Gala last May.

Happy Birthday, Rihanna: See Her Fashion Moments Through the Years, Photos View Gallery Launch Gallery: Happy Birthday, Rihanna: See Her Fashion Moments Through the Years, Photos","Rihanna put an elegant twist on lingerie styling and added exaggerated proportions to her Saint Laurent look for the premiere of the animated film “Smurfs” in Los Angeles on Sunday. The Savage x Fenty founder attended the premiere alongside her sons, three-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and two-year-old Riot Rose Mayers, both of whom wore Dior Men suits. Rihanna was wearing a look from Saint Laurent's fall 2025 ready-to-wear collection, which debuted during Paris Fashion Week last March. The Grammy Award-winning artist's attire featured a black dress with lacy, lingerie-inspired detailing at the bust. The lace detailing transitioned into a silky smooth fabric. The look featured a drop-waist element to accentuate the singer's baby bump, which she debuted at the 2025 Met Gala last May.

On Sunday, July 13, the singer brought her two sons, RZA, 3 and Riot, 23 months, for a special night out at the Smurfs premiere in Los Angeles. While the evening was a celebration of Rihanna's new acting gig — she voices Smurfette in the animated film — it also turned into a runway show once the trio stepped onto the carpet. The 37-year-old Fenty Beauty founder, who is expecting her third child with A$AP Rocky, made a statement in a bump-baring Saint Laurent Fall 2025 gown with lace cups, a full skirt and an olive green ribbon cinching her waist. She teamed it with a leather moto jacket and pink glam topped with a high bun.

Turns out, her little ones were also dressed to the nines in miniature menswear looks drawn directly from Jonathan Anderson's first collection for Dior Homme, which debuted on June 27 during Paris Men's Fashion Week. Riot wore a custom toddler's version of one of Anderson's ensembles that featured a green single-breasted jacket, a white shirt with a matching bow tie and flared white shorts. Although, the model's fisherman sandals were traded out for adorable oxford shoes. RZA's outfit — which comprised of a pink button-up shirt and tie and dark green cargo pants — appeared to be an interpretation of one of the Dior runway designs.

A Milan Court has put Loro Piana into a judicial administration procedure concerning alleged worker exploitation in the Italian luxury brand's supply chain. Loro Piana in a statement on Monday evening said it “acknowledges the notification received from the Court of Milan's Preventive Measure Section today regarding labor practices by undisclosed and unauthorized subcontractors of one of its suppliers.” The Italian luxury company stated that “in breach of its legal and contractual obligations, the supplier did not inform Loro Piana of the existence of these subcontractors. Loro Piana was made aware of this situation on May 20, and, as a result, the maison terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours.” Furthermore, “Loro Piana firmly condemns any illegal practices and reaffirms its unwavering commitment to upholding human rights and compliance with all applicable regulations throughout its supply chain. Loro Piana is committed to ensuring that all its suppliers comply with the maison's highest quality and ethical standards in line with its Code of Conduct. In this perspective, Loro Piana has been constantly reviewing and will continue to strengthen its control and audit activities.” According to media reports, Loro Piana sells cashmere jackets with a price tag of 3,000 euros, which, through its subcontractors, would allegedly actually cost only 100 euros. The firm denied this claim. “The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier, nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.” Looking ahead, Loro Piana concluded by stating that it “expresses its full willingness to cooperate with the relevant authorities on this matter and intends to provide the utmost support for any further investigations.” Loro Piana is controlled by the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and is helmed by chief executive officer Frédéric Arnault, who succeeded Damian Bertrand last month. Bertrand is now chairman of the brand and has moved to become deputy CEO of Louis Vuitton. This is only the latest luxury brand to incur in such a probe. Dior, also part of LVMH, and the Giorgio Armani Group have also been investigated for allegedly using suppliers who subjected workers to poor conditions, including inadequate wages, and potentially misleading consumers about their commitment to ethical standards, labor practices and artisanal production. Both brands have seen the judicial administration procedures lifted after taking steps to improve their supply chain and labor practices. In February, a Milan court ordered the revocation of the judicial administration imposed since April last year on Giorgio Armani Operations, a unit of the namesake designer's fashion group, over the labor practices of its Chinese-owned subcontractors. At the time, the Armani Group said in a statement that the decision to revoke the judicial administration was made because the company has taken all the necessary corrective action and “already had a structured and tested system of controls and protection of its supply chain.” The revocation came ahead of the one-year deadline initially expected, it pointed out. The statement underscored that the decision was also made because the court recognized the group's craftsmanship as Armani's suppliers “are often to be identified as highly qualified artisans, especially regarding Italian production, characterized by the highest level of sophistication and quality.” Last year, judges also placed an Italian subsidiary of Dior, which produced handbags for the French brand, under the same form of special administration, again for lack of control over its supply chain. In May, the French fashion house was cleared of any wrongdoing and said it remains “committed to upholding our values of transparency and respect throughout our supply chain. This further underscores the maison's steadfast and historic dedication to pursuing both rigorous Made in Italy products and the highest standards of ethics and excellence.” Alviero Martini was also investigated over alleged worker exploitation, and in May, a unit of Valentino specialized in bags was placed under judicial administration for a year by the Milan court after worker abuse was uncovered at subcontractors. Following the move, Valentino said it had intensified its supplier evaluation process across its supply chain in recent years and would cooperate with the relevant authorities to “fully understand the circumstances that have led to the measures taken by the judiciary in this specific case.”","Referring to ""undisclosed and unauthorized subcontractors of one of its suppliers,"" the Italian luxury company stated that ""in breach of its legal and contractual obligations, the supplier did not inform Loro Piana of the existence of these subcontractors.""

Rihanna put a fresh spin on a beloved silhouette — a crop top and low-rise bottom — with the white set by Alaïa's Pieter Mulier, per Vogue. The top's hood draped down into a high neckline, but left room for the singer's bold diamond earrings to peek through. The floor-length skirt featured a sculptural roll of padding around the waistband, creating a flared look at her hips. Rihanna completed the look with black rectangular shades and a stack of diamond bracelets. BACKGRID Rihanna on July 13. The white look was her second of the night: earlier at the Smurfs premiere, Rihanna donned another drop-waist silhouette, this time in a deep-brown shade. The singer, who voices ""Smurfette"" in the upcoming animated film, arrived in a mermaid dress from Saint Laurent's Fall 2025 collection: a delicate lace bodice and a voluminous full skirt, with an olive green ribbon sitting at the waist. She paired the dress with an oversized leather jacket of similar hue, and piled her hair into a high updo. Her two sons, Riot, 1 ½, and RZA, 3, joined her for the premiere — and also showed up in designer looks. Both boys sported looks from Jonathan Anderson's debut collection for Dior Homme, which recently unveiled during Paris Men's Fashion Week on June 27.

mov_72986CA310AC3B29CFD8ABD43F4EE16C,"  The biggest airport serving Italy's fashion capital of Milan has strengthened its high-end retail offer by introducing French heavyweights Dior and Louis Vuitton to anchor its luxury line-up with the largest boutiques at the gateway. Milan Malpensa Airport—which handled almost 30 million passengers last year, up 11%—is continuing its strategy of establishing itself as a premier European destination for high-end shopping. The operator, SEA Milan Airports, which also runs the smaller airport of Milan Linate, is stepping up its luxury offer in line with the city's rising popularity as a place to shop tax-free. According to tax refund specialist Global Blue, between December 2024 and February 2025), Milan accounted for 9% of total tax-free sales in Continental Europe with an average spend of €2,240 ($2,615), bettered only by Paris with a 22% share and average spending of €2,660 ($3,105). Both the Dior and Louis Vuitton boutiques are directly operated by the brands and have significant footprints at about 4,800 and 6,100 square feet, respectively. They take the number of luxury brands at Malpensa to 22, not including various corners and pop-ups within Avolta's large duty-free stores at the airport. The two new arrivals are strategically located in one of the most prominent areas of Terminal 1, and their eye-catching storefronts are now the first to be seen by passengers as they exit the security area into the retail spaces. Other big-name boutiques in T1 include Armani, Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Bulgari, Damiani, Hermès, Ferragamo, Moncler, Tod's and Zegna, many of them centered around a Davide Oldani Cafè. Luigi Battuello, chief commercial officer of SEA, commented: “With the arrival of Dior and Louis Vuitton, Malpensa cements its status as a benchmark for premium airport shopping. The investment by these iconic brands reflects our vision of an increasingly international, modern gateway—credible to partners and attentive to the needs of global travellers.” Milan lures global luxury shoppers Last year, T1 had the most international passengers of any SEA terminal and/or airports at 30%. European passengers accounted for 21%, North Americans 4%, and North Mediterranean Africa and the Middle East passengers, 2%. Intercontinental air traffic at Malpensa has been growing again and should support Dior and Louis Vuitton, both of which have been expanding at key hub airport like Qatar's Hamad International and others. In the first five months of 2025, luxury sales increased by a solid 18% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by the rise in high-spending international travelers. Average transaction value also rose by more than 9% year-over-year. This builds on an already strong 2024 for luxury, which was up a very healthy 21%. As with most airports in Europe, high-end retail sales drivers are non-European Union passengers, particularly from Asia and the Middle East. They account for over 80% of luxury purchases. T1 is, by far, the strongest terminal for non-EU customers. In 2024, across the SEA network (Malpensa and Linate combined), sales rose by 15% reaching record commercial revenue of €470 million ($550 million). Food and beverage ticked up higher at 16.6%. Malpensa has created a high-end commercial district at the airport, claiming to have a shopping experience “on par” with Milan's downtown Quadrilatero della Moda fashion district, where streets like Via Monte Napoleone are world famous and a magnet for luxury shoppers from all over the world. Global Blue ranks Milan ahead of Florence and Rome as the most strategic destination for international travel shopping in Italy. The fashion capital benefits from Italy's global reputation for fashion and craftsmanship, although this is being tarnished by scrutiny into alleged abuse of workers through subcontracting practices. Loro Piana, an LVMH house known for cashmere items, became the fifth high-end label in Italy to be put under judicial administration following investigations that started in 2023.","The biggest airport serving Italy's fashion capital of Milan has strengthened its high-end retail offer by introducing French heavyweights Dior and Louis Vuitton to anchor its luxury line-up with the largest boutiques at the gateway. Milan Malpensa Airport—which handled almost 30 million passengers last year, up 11%—is continuing its strategy of establishing itself as a premier European destination for high-end shopping. The operator, SEA Milan Airports, which also runs the smaller airport of Milan Linate, is stepping up its luxury offer in line with the city's rising popularity as a place to shop tax-free. According to tax refund specialist Global Blue, between December 2024 and February 2025), Milan accounted for 9% of total tax-free sales in Continental Europe with an average spend of €2,240 ($2,615), bettered only by Paris with a 22% share and average spending of €2,660 ($3,105). Both the Dior and Louis Vuitton boutiques are directly operated by the brands and have significant footprints at about 4,800 and 6,100 square feet, respectively. They take the number of luxury brands at Malpensa to 22, not including various corners and pop-ups within Avolta's large duty-free stores at the airport. The two new arrivals are strategically located in one of the most prominent areas of Terminal 1, and their eye-catching storefronts are now the first to be seen by passengers as they exit the security area into the retail spaces. Other big-name boutiques in T1 include Armani, Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Bulgari, Damiani, Hermès, Ferragamo, Moncler, Tod's and Zegna, many of them centered around a Davide Oldani Cafè. Luigi Battuello, chief commercial officer of SEA, commented: “With the arrival of Dior and Louis Vuitton, Malpensa cements its status as a benchmark for premium airport shopping. The investment by these iconic brands reflects our vision of an increasingly international, modern gateway—credible to partners and attentive to the needs of global travellers.” Milan lures global luxury shoppers Last year, T1 had the most international passengers of any SEA terminal and/or airports at 30%. European passengers accounted for 21%, North Americans 4%, and North Mediterranean Africa and the Middle East passengers, 2%. Intercontinental air traffic at Malpensa has been growing again and should support Dior and Louis Vuitton, both of which have been expanding at key hub airport like Qatar's Hamad International and others. In the first five months of 2025, luxury sales increased by a solid 18% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by the rise in high-spending international travelers. Average transaction value also rose by more than 9% year-over-year. This builds on an already strong 2024 for luxury, which was up a very healthy 21%. As with most airports in Europe, high-end retail sales drivers are non-European Union passengers, particularly from Asia and the Middle East. They account for over 80% of luxury purchases. T1 is, by far, the strongest terminal for non-EU customers. In 2024, across the SEA network (Malpensa and Linate combined), sales rose by 15% reaching record commercial revenue of €470 million ($550 million). Food and beverage ticked up higher at 16.6%.

July 15, 2025, 1:05am Macy's may be holding on to its longtime position as the top U.S. retailer by share of fragrance sales, but plenty of other shifts are afoot when it comes to who's winning the category. According to YipitData, Macy's accounted for 31.8 percent of fragrance sales during the month of May, indicating a 14.7-point lead from the category's next-biggest retailer during the period, Ulta Beauty. While significant, that lead is several points less than it was, say, two years prior in 2023, when Macy's accounted for more than 40 percent of fragrance sales during the same month. This shift is in part due to the nascent growth of alternative fragrance retailers as formidable competitors in the space. There's Amazon, which, per YipitData, accounted for 14.9 percent of fragrance sales in May across the platform's first- and third-party sellers (tracking after Sephora, which accounted for 15.5 percent during the same period). TikTok Shop, too, wasn't on the map at all in the U.S. until halfway through 2023, yet today the e-tailer — which has propelled brands from Lattafa to Phlur to virality — goes head-to-head with Target in terms of share of fragrance sales, actually outpacing Target slightly in May. Year-to-date, the top three fragrance brands at Sephora have been Kayali, Sol de Janeiro and YSL Beauty, in that order. For the month of May, Valentino overtook YSL for the number-three spot, while in April, Chanel's Chance Eau Splendide Eau de Parfum was the retailer's top-selling new stock keeping unit across the store. On Amazon, which YipitData reports has gained modest but steady share in fragrance since 2023, winning brands range from value-driven to designer, a dynamic which the platform's top two brands in May — Lattafa and Versace — quintessentially represent. Other top 10 brands on Amazon include Sol de Janeiro, Nautica and Dior (which, like all brands owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, does not officially sell on the platform). So far in 2025, fragrance has been the fastest-growing category in beauty, as has been the case since 2021. According to Circana, the category grew 4 percent in the prestige market and 8 percent in mass during the first quarter of this year.

The Asia Luxury Goods Market is anticipated to see massive growth, increasing from USD 135.25 billion in 2024 to USD 192.17 billion by 2033, with a CACR of 3.98%. The development is driven by increasing disposable income, increased brand consciousness, and an increasing middle-class population in nations like China, India, and Japan. Enhanced digital shopping channels and travel are also increasing the demand for high-end and premium luxury brands in the market. Luxury products command a wide popularity base with strong demand in regions such as Asia, North America, and Europe. In the past few years, new markets such as China, India, and the Middle East have seen growth at a fast rate because of increasing disposable incomes and online luxury consumption. Luxury products are not only consumed for personal use but also as gifts, investments, and collectibles. The shift towards experiential luxury, such as travel and personalized services, also reflects international luxury consumers' evolving tastes. Drivers of Growth in the Asia Luxury Goods Market Rising Middle Class and Disposable Incomes Asia's increasing middle class is fueling the luxury goods industry. With rising disposable income, customers are seeking premium products as symbols of prestige and markers of individual achievement. China and India are witnessing a surge in high-income consumers who value quality and brand prestige highly. This demographic shift is expanding the customer base for luxury products, leading to increased sales and market penetration in the region. Nearly 65% of the middle class will reside in Asia by 2030, approximately 3.5 billion people. Digital Transformation and E-commerce Expansion The rapid rise of digital technologies has reshaped the Asian luxury retail environment. E-commerce sites and social media platforms are now vital marketing channels for brands to engage with consumers, especially younger generations. Online sales of luxury products are on the rise, as brands are spending in digital showrooms, live-streamed experiences, and custom-made digital experiences to drive maximum customer engagement and sales. Lancome, an L'Oreal group, introduced Lancome Happiness Nights initially in 2021 by offering a live-in-experience immersion from its store on Paris's Champs-Elysees. Dior offered access to its VIP July 2022 fashion show and the possibility of discussing 'live' with make-up specialists and getting guidance on beauty tips. Live-shopping will be accounting for about 20% of worldwide online purchases by 2026, McKinsey finds in the wake of a survey. Tourism and Duty-Free Shopping Tourism plays a significant role in driving the Asian luxury market. Japan and South Korea, among other nations, receive tourists who propel luxury sales via duty-free shopping. The appeal of tax-free buys and carefully selected merchandise available at airports and tourist areas boosts luxury sales. Additionally, the restart of international travel as a result of the decline of the pandemic will also propel this segment. For instance, as reported by the industry, duty-free sales in Japan generated USD 450.7 Million in May 2024, where duty-free products totaling around 566,000 purchases were made by shoppers, whose products mainly included high-value duty-free items such as luxury bags and jewelry. Challenges in the Asia Luxury Goods Market Counterfeit Products and Brand Dilution The explosion of counterfeit luxury goods poses a significant risk to brand reputation and consumer trust. Pirated versions, offered at lower prices, devalue brands and deter prospective customers. Luxury brands need to invest in anti-counterfeiting measures, including blockchain technology and authentication services, to protect their reputation and maintain product authenticity. Economic Uncertainty and Market Volatility Economic fluctuations such as currency devaluation and inflation may influence consumer spending on luxury goods. For instance, China's luxury market slowed down in 2024 with reduced domestic spending and increased tourist shopping abroad. Such volatility necessitates luxury brands to be agile, adapting strategies to make them robust during economic downturns.

mov_23EF8CE44131F7DB4C0BF33D6C26E01A,"  Italian fashion house Loro Piana, owned by French giant LVMH, has been placed under court administration for allegedly facilitating the exploitation of workers by subcontractors. In a statement, the carabinieri police said the company had been deemed “incapable of preventing or curbing labour exploitation within the production cycle by failing to implement adequate measures to verify the actual working conditions or the technical capacities of its contractors”. An investigation found the fashion house entrusted the production of its clothing, including cashmere jackets, to a company without production facilities. That firm outsourced the work to another company, which in turn used workshops in Italy employing Chinese workers to save costs, the statement said. In these workshops, irregular workers were exploited without respecting health and safety rules, particularly regarding wages, working hours, breaks and holidays, investigators found. The judges of the Milan court found that Loro Piana “negligently facilitated” the exploitation, according to the police statement. The court however stressed that the one-year administration was intended as “preventative”, not a punishment, according to the court document seen by AFP. It was aimed at “combating the unlawful contamination of healthy businesses by subjecting them to judicial oversight” where they can be removed from “criminal infiltration”. In a statement, Loro Piana said it had terminated ties with its supplier within 24 hours of discovering the existence of its subcontractors on May 20, and was fully cooperating with authorities. “Loro Piana strongly condemns any illegal practices and reaffirms its ongoing commitment to protecting human rights and complying with all applicable regulations throughout its entire supply chain,” it said. The investigation began in May following a complaint from a Chinese worker who claimed he was beaten by his boss after demanding payment of back wages, police said. The police carried out inspections in factories run by Chinese citizens in the area surrounding Milan, finding violations of workplace rules as well as illegally built dormitories and unsanitary conditions. Proceedings were brought against two Chinese nationals who owned workshops, two Italians for violations of workplace health and safety standards, and seven workers without residence permits. The court also imposed fines totalling over 181,000 euros ($211,000) and administrative penalties of around 60,000 euros. The operations of two Chinese workshops were also suspended “for serious safety violations and the use of undeclared labour”, the police statement said. Loro Piana was acquired by LVMH in 2013, and is currently led by Frederic Arnault, son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault. The company did not comment on the proceedings in Milan. The Italian justice system has already carried out similar proceedings against other fashion houses including Armani. In May, the Italian competition authority cleared luxury brand Dior — also owned by LVMH — of violations in working conditions but required it to pay a two-million-euro fine towards “victims of exploitation”.

1m0k6i8,"  While the world was busy with Amazon Prime Day and Flipkart sale(I did end up buying Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Headphones and Logitech G29 Racing Wheel), I decided to pull the trigger on the fragrance which got me into this world - Creed Aventus and added a bunch of others to my ever-growing collection (attaching pics of the new purchases and the overall collection as well) BACKGROUND (Might be a slightly lengthy storytime, I recommend reading through the non-sense but feel free to skip to the review section if you want): I got into fragrances through my flatmate. He had a 200ML Dior Sauvage which I liked. I started researching the top fragrances and found the man, the myth, the legend: Jeremy Fragrance. Creed Aventus was a regular part of his videos and I was always intrigued by it. I managed to get my nose on it in airports and offline stores and loved it, but always found it to be too expensive for what was being offered. That was a time I was big on clones and thought they offer the same value as the 20k niche brands. But as we all experience in our fragrance journeys, there comes a time when the clones start to smell cheap and we start appreciating the quality and nuance we get by paying that extra amount of money for designer or niche fragrances. Soon clones smell alcoholic and synthetic, no matter the brand and that's the stage I'm in, where CDNIN doesn't do the job anymore. The day finally came, when I pulled the trigger on my fragrance journey ever-present aspiration of Creed Aventus and graduated in my fragrance journey finally REVIEW: 1. Creed Aventus (F batch): The smoky pineapple DNA still gets me. Amazing pineapple opening. Projects heavily for the first 4 hours. Drys down to a smoky pineapple smell and lasts 6-8 hours on skin and 12 hours on clothes. Still an amazing compliment puller and an all occasion, all weather scent. Love the smell, got a ton of compliments in office and highly recommend. The quality and finesse of the original cannot be replicated by any of the clones out there and I've tried them all. Still a beast mode fragrance. 10/10 will recommend if you have the budget 2. Kilian Roses on Ice: Have been obsessed with this DNA since a few months. Smells like a fresh cucumber with a gin and tonic touch to it. Super fresh and uplifting. Perfect for summers and monsoon. Again, an expensive fragrance, recommend this only if you have extra money lying around. Projects and lasts like a beast, as expected from a high quality brand like Kilian 3. Fraganote After Shave: All Fraganote fragrances have magnetic caps and amazing bottles with one of the best pressurized atomisers I've seen. I bought this thinking it'll be like Old Spice, and though it shares some similarities, it's still it's own blend. An original creation and not a clone of anything. Proud and amazed by Fraganote for sticking to creating original scents profiles and not succumbing to being a clone house, as most brands tend to do at this price point. Coming to the fragrance, a nice clean barbershop scent, lasts long and projects well. Perfect for office 4. Fraganote Not Just Mango: Super unique, the only Mango fragrance I've ever smelled. That being said, it can be polarizing, smells like a mango ice-cream bar. Lasts long and is only suited for parties where you want to be noticed and stand out for being different 5. Fraganote Pineapple Club: A good pineapple scent. Nothing like Creed Aventus or Hacivat, has its own DNA, and does stand out. Smells like freshly cut pineapple but the note is very subtle, and smells super fresh. Can be a good office scent All Fraganote fragrances lasted well and projected well. Again, I understand the financial decision of fragrance houses operating in this price range to stick to clones and smells you know will work, saving R&D costs and turning a profit at fraction of the original price. Extremely bold for Fraganote to create their own fragrances at 1200 per 50 ML price and experiment. Hope they keep doing this and bring unique scents to our noses","While the world was busy with Amazon Prime Day and Flipkart sale(I did end up buying Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Headphones and Logitech G29 Racing Wheel), I decided to pull the trigger on the fragrance which got me into this world - Creed Aventus and added a bunch of others to my ever-growing collection (attaching pics of the new purchases and the overall collection as well) BACKGROUND (Might be a slightly lengthy storytime, I recommend reading through the non-sense but feel free to skip to the review section if you want): I got into fragrances through my flatmate.

mov_A4B1FF7CC0C5A3DFB57B35B953D8FC83,"  The 2025 MLB All-Star festivities are upon us, with the sport's biggest stars descending on Atlanta this week. Before the AL and NL All-Stars got into uniform for Tuesday night's game, the players and their families arrived in style on the red carpet. Who was best-dressed and who missed the mark? Yahoo Sports breaks it all down below: Ronald Acuña Jr. is as reliable as they come on the All-Star red carpet. As the video below calls out, he's put together some incredible looks over the years, and this year was no different. As usual, the bling was blinding, with Acuña sporting a circular Atlanta-themed pendant he said he designed himself. I wasn't familiar with your game, Tarik Skubal. The AL starting pitcher brought high fashion to the carpet in an all-black look featuring Dior, Valentino and Jil Sander. The chains and sunglasses complete the cool, effortless vibe. Skubal may not have known what he was wearing, but whoever is dressing him, keep it up. We see you, Aaron Judge! The Yankees star naturally incorporated pinstripes into his look, rocking a sleek summer-vibe suit paired with leather boots in a combination that just works. His wife, Samantha, complements the look with her cream-colored peplum detail minidress. Continuing with the summer-white theme, Yoshinobu Yamamoto channeled Hollywood glam with this sharp, formal look. The details, from the tie accessory to the watch, are on point. Yankees star Jazz Chisholm Jr. always shows out, and this year was no different as he sported a very on-trend belted suit jacket, plus a set of brooches.

1m1k8uf,"  ## Fashion Roundup: July 16, 2025 The fashion world on July 16, 2025, offered a blend of glamour, cultural preservation, and the ever-present influence of celebrity collaborations. From the opulence of Bollywood costume design to the stylish convergence of global icons, the day's news highlights the evolving landscape of style. **Bollywood's Extravagant Costumes: A Celebration of Heritage** One of the key narratives emerging from the day's fashion news centers on the artistry and expense behind Bollywood film costumes. The industry's dedication to creating visually stunning and historically accurate wardrobes was showcased, moving beyond mere fashion and delving into cultural preservation and cinematic storytelling. Film productions are increasingly investing heavily in costume design, recognizing its critical role in immersing audiences in the narrative and enhancing the overall cinematic experience. The article specifically highlighted some of the most iconic and expensive costumes in Bollywood history. The red bridal lehenga worn by Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the film *Jodhaa Akbar* stands out as a significant example. The lehenga, a testament to India's rich textile heritage, has achieved global recognition, finding a permanent place in fashion history and recently being added to the Academy Museum's ""Colour in Motion"" exhibition. This underscores the growing recognition of Bollywood costumes as works of art and cultural artifacts, solidifying their place in fashion's legacy. This development demonstrates the growing importance of costume design and its recognition as a critical element of film success, while also promoting cultural heritage through the lens of fashion. **Celebrity Collaborations and Style Crossovers:** Another significant trend shaping the fashion news cycle on July 16th was the ongoing influence of celebrity endorsements and style crossovers. The convergence of global icons, in particular, drove significant attention, demonstrating how celebrities can influence trends on social media platforms. The announcement of a collaboration between Formula 1 legend Lewis Hamilton and BTS member Jimin sparked considerable excitement within their combined fanbases. Hamilton's subtle acknowledgement of Jimin wearing an outfit from his Dior menswear collection on Instagram Stories was enough to ignite the internet. The post, accompanied by a handshake emoji and the simple caption ""my @dior collection (sic),"" immediately sent waves of enthusiasm through both ARMY (BTS fans) and motorsport enthusiasts. This demonstrates the power of celebrity endorsements and the potential for individual style choices to influence and drive trends across different spheres of culture. This type of engagement illustrates how social media has become a critical platform for showcasing fashion and solidifying celebrity style, showcasing the significance of brand collaboration within the industry. **Fashion Journalism and Current Trends:** The day's fashion news was rounded out by the ongoing efforts of the fashion journalism landscape. A subscription-based newsletter, ""Fashion Statement,"" offered a curated overview of current trends, commentary, and solutions to wardrobe dilemmas. This newsletter showcases the need for journalists to compile information for their readers. The newsletter and fashion journalism, in general, provides context, insight, and analysis of the fashion industry, which assists its readers in navigating the complexities of the world of style. **Key Takeaways:** The fashion news of July 16, 2025, provides several key takeaways for fashion enthusiasts and industry observers alike. First and foremost, it highlights the significance of integrating cultural and historical contexts into fashion. The inclusion of the *Jodhaa Akbar* lehenga in the Academy Museum's exhibition underscores the importance of preserving heritage and celebrating the artistry of costume design. Secondly, the story reflects the increasing power of celebrity influence, highlighting the crucial role of collaborations and endorsements in shaping trends. The convergence of Lewis Hamilton and Jimin demonstrates how celebrity personalities and brands can be leveraged to reach wider audiences. This continues to grow the importance of social media as a means of communication and trendsetting within the fashion space. Finally, the news summarizes the ongoing evolution of fashion journalism in providing the consumer with reliable and easy-to-digest information to help make the trends more accessible for everyone. In conclusion, the fashion landscape on July 16th, 2025, presented a multifaceted view, demonstrating a strong appreciation for artistry, cultural heritage, and the ever-present influence of celebrity culture, all of which will continue to shape the industry for years to come.

The post, accompanied by a handshake emoji and the simple caption ""my collection (sic),"" immediately sent waves of enthusiasm through both ARMY (BTS fans) and motorsport enthusiasts. This demonstrates the power of celebrity endorsements and the potential for individual style choices to influence and drive trends across different spheres of culture. This type of engagement illustrates how social media has become a critical platform for showcasing fashion and solidifying celebrity style, showcasing the significance of brand collaboration within the industry. **Fashion Journalism and Current Trends:** The day's fashion news was rounded out by the ongoing efforts of the fashion journalism landscape.

mov_057C48B10872CD48C228586C820DDDBA,"  Season three of The Summer I Turned Pretty kicks off on Wednesday. The night before three of the top cast members, whose characters are in a love triangle on the weepy teen saga, talked to The Tonight Show about which one will end up with beauty Isabel 'Belly' Conklin. The stars of the hit show are Lola Tung (as Belly), Gavin Casalegno (who plays Jeremiah) and Christopher Briney (who stars as brooding hunk Conrad). 'Season 2 ended with a major cliffhanger. This was a big deal. I mean, your character, Belly, chose Jeremiah over Conrad,' Jimmy Fallon said  before asking Tung what she thought about that ending. 'I'm all for her following her heart,' the actress shared as she said she was 'Team Belly.' Belly was careful to not give any secretive plot details away. She continued: 'And she's doing what she needs to do in the moment, and following her heart in that moment and in every moment.' In a snippet shared during the show, viewers see Belly watching Jeremiah play Twister when Conrad calls him. Jeremiah asks Belly to answer and she and Conrad have an awkward exchange. When asked about Season 3, Tung said, 'I think it's a lot more of the emotional rollercoaster you're used to, I guess, and also, you know, there's a little time jump, so we meet the characters in a little bit of a more mature place, I think.' Season three takes place four years after season two ended. While on The Tonight Show Tung wore a John Galliano for Dior corset dress from a 2001 collection, along with a pair of 2013 Dior Mary Jane pumps as she accessorized with Panconesi earrings. In a trailer for the show's third and final season, Conrad is seen asking Belly's best friend Taylor (played by Rain Spencer) for advice about his plan to come back into Belly's life. It's clear he is ready to win her over again. The first two episodes of season 3 of The Summer I Turned Pretty will premiere on Prime Video on Wednesday, July 16. Season three will consist of 10 episodes. The program, which had viewers crying hard enough to give themselves migraines, has become one of Amazon Prime Video's most popular shows. Amazon and MGM Studios' head of television, Vernon Sanders, issued a statement to elaborate on the success of the coming-of-age series. 'We've been delighted to see the passion with which fans have embraced The Summer I Turned Pretty, making Summer Fridays an entertainment phenomenon,' he said. Sanders went on to speak about how The Summer I Turned Pretty, which was created by Jenny Han, had quickly become a fan-favorite program. 'This charming, deeply heartfelt series has shown the breadth of our customer base, appealing to a young, diverse set of viewers. Jenny Han is a gifted storyteller, whose fans have been clamoring for the third chapter of this story,' he stated. The Summer I Turned Pretty is based on Han's book of the same name, which was originally released in 2009. The book was followed up by a pair of sequels that were published in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The series is centered on Isabel 'Belly' Conklin, a teenage girl who ends up in a love triangle with a pair of brothers.","Season three of The Summer I Turned Pretty kicks off on Wednesday.

44DF2738300840B12C56DCAB4CD23D30,"  Appearances at Wimbledon and a French state visit symbolize a new kind of style. Earlier this year, when Catherine, the Princess of Wales, returned to the public eye after her treatment for cancer, The Sunday Times of London reported that she was doing so with a caveat: She wanted to focus on her work, not her clothes. Her office would no longer share information about what she wore. Cue shock and horror. Even if it was understandable, given what she had been through, and even if the report was later disputed by the palace itself, it sent tremors through the fashion-watching community. That was partly because the princess could change the fortunes of a designer or a brand simply by wearing a dress. And it was partly because she had long used her place in the attention economy to shine a light not just on British products, but on issues like sustainability by remaking and rewearing pieces from her closet, and even renting the occasional evening gown. Mostly, though, it was because the clothes are an expression of her role as a symbol -- of the country and that fine line between continuity and modernization. Stepping back from one suggested she was stepping back from the other. It's a weird thing to essentially be an avatar, but it's the job. As her appearance at the Wimbledon men's and women's finals, and at the French state visit, demonstrated, however, Catherine may be more selective about her appearances (she did skip Ascot), but she is no less strategic. She is simply being Catherine 3.0. There she was, after all, at the state visit, welcoming Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron in a blush-colored Dior suit with a New Look jacket and a skirt covered in net, just brushing her calves. The brand is both classic French and about to be led by a designer from Northern Ireland who was trained in Britain. It was a considered nod to political alliance (the kind she has practiced since marrying Prince William) that she repeated at the French state banquet, wearing a red Givenchy gown with a built-in cape sweeping down from her shoulders. It was regal, sure, but also strategic, given that Givenchy is now designed by Sarah Burton, the British designer who made Catherine's wedding gown and who has been her collaborator on numerous high-profile public occasions. Talk about entente. And there Catherine was at the Wimbledon women's final in a cream jacket and long pleated skirt, a coolly appropriate riff on tennis whites and her position as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club. So, too, the royal blue ankle-length Roksanda dress she wore to the men's final was perfectly coordinated with Prince William's blue blazer, Prince George's blue suit and Princess Charlotte's white dress trimmed in blue, all creating a literal picture of family unity. All demonstrating that Catherine is as attuned as ever to the role image-making plays in her job. That's not new. What is new, however, is the style in which she is doing it, and its consistency. Her skirts have gotten longer, her jackets more tailored, her silhouette more streamlined. The effect of dropping her hemlines even a few inches is both oddly nostalgic and sophisticated, gently protective. A reminder that she is dressing for the long game. Like the lanky pantsuits she had adopted for her everyday appearances, her style is shaping up as a new formula for dressing. As recognizable, in its own way, as the monochrome formula that served Queen Elizabeth II so well: shoes-to-coat-to-dress-to-hat in one shade. And it brings a new dimension to the symbolism inherent in Catherine's role. She is representing not just the next generation of the royal family, which itself represents tradition. She is representing the idea of elegance emerging from adversity, an idea that has both micro and macro associations. Who couldn't use some of that right about now?","Appearances at Wimbledon and a French state visit symbolize a new kind of style.

mov_1480FE2F66456D821BEA3DE7B6C837E6,"  Quick Answer Who makes Dior jewellery? Dior's high jewellery is designed and crafted in France, but not all of the brand's jewellery is made there. For special collections and intricate handwork, Dior collaborates with skilled artisans all over the world, including India. Costume jewellery and components may be produced or assembled elsewhere, including in China. The Illusion of 100% “Made in France” Luxury brands like Dior sell more than jewellery; they sell an image. “Made in France” suggests artisans working in light-filled Parisian workshops, hand-setting diamonds in silence. And while that's partly true for Dior's Haute Joaillerie line, it's far from the whole picture. Today's luxury industry runs on global production. To keep up with demand, and to access the best traditional craftsmanship, Dior, like many luxury maisons, relies on a mix of in-house ateliers and long-standing external partners across continents. Read – Jewellery Trends for 2025 – From Fashion to High Jewellery Dior's Mumbai Collection: A Testament to Indian Artistry One of the most visible acknowledgements of Dior's global sourcing came with the Fall 2023 Mumbai Collection. The show, staged in front of the Gateway of India, celebrated the deep creative friendship between Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior's former artistic director, and Karishma Swali, director of Chanakya ateliers and the Chanakya School of Craft. For over two decades, Chanakya has produced exquisite hand-embroidery, textile art, and jewellery detailing for Dior's most intricate pieces. In the Mumbai Collection, Indian artisans weren't behind the scenes—they were the stars. The show featured: Jewellery and embroidery entirely handmade in India Craft rooted in centuries-old techniques, passed down through generations A spotlight on female empowerment through Chanakya's work with women artisans This collaboration is a counter-narrative to the typical outsourcing story. It's not about cutting costs; it's about preserving vanishing traditions and elevating them on a global stage. Who Makes Dior Jewellery—Really? Let's break it down: Type of JewelleryWhere It's MadeHaute Joaillerie (Fine Jewellery)Designed and crafted in Paris, often with French-sourced gemsSpecial collaborations (e.g. Mumbai Collection)Handcrafted in India, especially at Chanakya ateliersCostume jewelleryOften assembled in Europe, with components possibly sourced from China or Thailand At the helm of Dior's jewellery design is Victoire de Castellane, the long-time Artistic Director of Dior Joaillerie. Known for her bold, storytelling-rich aesthetic, Castellane has transformed the house's jewellery into miniature fairy tales of colour, movement, and meaning. Interestingly, she's also the sister of Mathilde Favier, the influential Head of PR Worldwide at Dior Couture, a dynamic sibling duo shaping both the image and the sparkle of the Dior universe. India's Historic Role in Jewellery Making India isn't new to high jewellery; in fact, it's where the world once looked for it. For centuries, India was a global centre for gemstone trade, diamond cutting, and gold craftsmanship. The Mughal Empire left behind a legacy of lavish, intricate jewels combining Persian, Hindu, and Islamic artistry. British royalty, including Queen Elizabeth II, received gifts of jewellery from Indian maharajas, such as the legendary Hyderabad Necklace, a diamond masterpiece that remains one of the Queen's most famous pieces. Today, cities like Jaipur and Surat continue this legacy, the latter being home to 90% of the world's diamond cutting and polishing.

Transparency in Luxury: Still a Work in Progress RJC (Responsible Jewellery Council) certifications don't always guarantee fair labour practices Most brands don't disclose full details of their supply chains...","Quick Answer Who makes Dior jewellery? Dior's high jewellery is designed and crafted in France, but not all of the brand's jewellery is made there. For special collections and intricate handwork, Dior collaborates with skilled artisans all over the world, including India. Costume jewellery and components may be produced or assembled elsewhere, including in China. The Illusion of 100% “Made in France” Luxury brands like Dior sell more than jewellery; they sell an image. “Made in France” suggests artisans working in light-filled Parisian workshops, hand-setting diamonds in silence. And while that's partly true for Dior's Haute Joaillerie line, it's far from the whole picture. Today's luxury industry runs on global production. To keep up with demand, and to access the best traditional craftsmanship, Dior, like many luxury maisons, relies on a mix of in-house ateliers and long-standing external partners across continents. Read – Jewellery Trends for 2025 – From Fashion to High Jewellery Dior's Mumbai Collection: A Testament to Indian Artistry One of the most visible acknowledgements of Dior's global sourcing came with the Fall 2023 Mumbai Collection. The show, staged in front of the Gateway of India, celebrated the deep creative friendship between Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior's former artistic director, and Karishma Swali, director of Chanakya ateliers and the Chanakya School of Craft. For over two decades, Chanakya has produced exquisite hand-embroidery, textile art, and jewellery detailing for Dior's most intricate pieces. In the Mumbai Collection, Indian artisans weren't behind the scenes—they were the stars. The show featured: Jewellery and embroidery entirely handmade in India Craft rooted in centuries-old techniques, passed down through generations A spotlight on female empowerment through Chanakya's work with women artisans This collaboration is a counter-narrative to the typical outsourcing story. It's not about cutting costs; it's about preserving vanishing traditions and elevating them on a global stage. Who Makes Dior Jewellery—Really? Let's break it down: Type of JewelleryWhere It's MadeHaute Joaillerie (Fine Jewellery)Designed and crafted in Paris, often with French-sourced gemsSpecial collaborations (e.g. Mumbai Collection)Handcrafted in India, especially at Chanakya ateliersCostume jewelleryOften assembled in Europe, with components possibly sourced from China or Thailand At the helm of Dior's jewellery design is Victoire de Castellane, the long-time Artistic Director of Dior Joaillerie. Known for her bold, storytelling-rich aesthetic, Castellane has transformed the house's jewellery into miniature fairy tales of colour, movement, and meaning. Interestingly, she's also the sister of Mathilde Favier, the influential Head of PR Worldwide at Dior Couture, a dynamic sibling duo shaping both the image and the sparkle of the Dior universe. India's Historic Role in Jewellery Making India isn't new to high jewellery; in fact, it's where the world once looked for it. For centuries, India was a global centre for gemstone trade, diamond cutting, and gold craftsmanship. The Mughal Empire left behind a legacy of lavish, intricate jewels combining Persian, Hindu, and Islamic artistry. British royalty, including Queen Elizabeth II, received gifts of jewellery from Indian maharajas, such as the legendary Hyderabad Necklace, a diamond masterpiece that remains one of the Queen's most famous pieces. Today, cities like Jaipur and Surat continue this legacy, the latter being home to 90% of the world's diamond cutting and polishing. So when Dior entrusts Indian ateliers like Chanakya with delicate embroidery and jewellery-making, it's not outsourcing, it's recognising generations of skill and prestige. China's Role: The Fast-Paced Side of Luxury China, on the other hand, plays a different role.

mov_503981BBB338F350B0CB3E22064C4C86,"  ABSTRACT Nina Christen designed some of the most influential shoes of the last decade. Now she has a line of her own. FULL TEXT Back in late 2018, a lifetime ago in fashion, a radical shift happened in footwear. Square-toed clunkers - sandals defined by exaggerated, spatula-like soles that jutted out from under the foot and pumps with bulbous stubbed toes - were shown in Daniel Lee's first collection for Bottega Veneta. At first sight, the shoes were hideous. Within months, they were on the feet of nearly every celebrity, editor, influencer and luxury V.I.C. in the land. Retailers like Vince Camuto and Shein promptly issued dupes of the popular Lido sandal, a simple slide in a blown-up interpretation of Bottega's signature intrecciato woven leather. Lyst declared them the ""hottest shoes in the world"" in 2019.

Now she has a line of her own. FULL TEXT Back in late 2018, a lifetime ago in fashion, a radical shift happened in footwear. Square-toed clunkers - sandals defined by exaggerated, spatula-like soles that jutted out from under the foot and pumps with bulbous stubbed toes - were shown in Daniel Lee's first collection for Bottega Veneta. At first sight, the shoes were hideous. Within months, they were on the feet of nearly every celebrity, editor, influencer and luxury V.I.C. in the land. Retailers like Vince Camuto and Shein promptly issued dupes of the popular Lido sandal, a simple slide in a blown-up interpretation of Bottega's signature intrecciato woven leather. Lyst declared them the ""hottest shoes in the world"" in 2019. ""It's funny what you can make people wear in fashion if it's done the right way,"" said Nina Christen, the Swiss shoe designer responsible for the Lido. Ms. Christen's distinctive touch has quite literally been all over some of the most influential shoe design trickling down from luxury houses for the better part of the last decade.

mov_9E3C81F41361729195AF80AB490A9CF9,"  A recent controversy surrounding Italian luxury label Prada has put the spotlight on how global fashion giants engage with India - a country whose rich artistic traditions have often suffered because of its inability to cash in on them. Prada got into trouble in June after its models walked the runway in Milan wearing , a handcrafted leather shoe made in India. The sandals are named after Kolhapur - a town in the western state of Maharashtra where they have been made for centuries - but the Prada collection did not mention this, prompting a backlash. As the controversy grew, Prada issued a statement saying it acknowledged the sandals' origins and that it was open to a ""dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans"". Over the past few days, a team from Prada met the artisans and shopkeepers in Kolhapur who make and sell the sandals to understand the process. Prada told the BBC that it held a ""successful meeting"" with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture, a prominent industry trade group. The statement also indicates that Prada may potentially collaborate in future with some manufacturers of Kolhapuri footwear. While it's not clear what form this collaboration may take, it's a rare example of a global fashion giant acknowledging that it failed to credit local artisans and the craft it was piggybacking on. Many big brands have been routinely accused of drawing inspiration from Indian, and wider South Asian, traditions in their quest to reinvent and stay relevant - but without crediting the source. Earlier this year, spring designs from Reformation and H&M after many said that their outfits appeared heavily inspired by South Asian garments. Both brands issued clarifications - while H&M denied the allegations, Reformation said its design was inspired by an outfit owned by a model with whom it had collaborated for the collection. And just two weeks ago, Dior was criticised after its highly-anticipated Paris collection featured a gold and ivory houndstooth coat, which many pointed out was crafted with mukaish work, a centuries-old metal embroidery technique from northern India. The collection did not mention the roots of the craft or India at all. The BBC has reached out to Dior for comment. Some experts say that not every brand that draws inspiration from a culture does so with wrong intentions - designers around the world invoke aesthetics from different traditions all the time, spotlighting them on a global scale. In the highly competitive landscape of fashion, some argue that brands also don't get enough time to think through the cultural ramifications of their choices. But critics point out that any borrowing needs to be underpinned by respect and acknowledgement, especially when these ideas are repurposed by powerful global brands to be sold at incredibly high prices. ""Giving due credit is a part of design responsibility, it's taught to you in design school and brands need to educate themselves about it,"" says Shefalee Vasudev, a Delhi-based fashion writer. Not doing so, she adds, is ""cultural neglect towards a part of the world which brands claim to love"". Estimates vary about the size of India's luxury market, but the region is widely seen as a big growth opportunity. Analysts from Boston Consulting Group say the luxury retail market in India by 2032. Powered by an expanding and affluent middle class, global luxury brands are increasingly eyeing India as a key market as they hope to make up for weaker demand elsewhere. But not everyone shares the optimism. Arvind Singhal, chairman of consultancy firm Technopak, says a big reason for the seeming indifference is that most brands still don't consider India a significant market for high-end luxury fashion. In recent years, many high-end malls with flagship luxury stores have opened up in big cities - but they rarely see significant footfall. ""Names like Prada still mean nothing to a majority of Indians. There is some demand among the super-rich, but hardly any first-time customers,"" Mr Singhal says. ""And this is simply not enough to build a business, making it easy to neglect the region altogether."" Anand Bhushan, a fashion designer from Delhi, agrees. He says that traditionally, India has always been a production hub rather than a potential market, with some of the most expensive brands in Paris and Milan employing Indian artisans to make or embroider their garments. ""But that still does not mean you can just blatantly lift a culture without understanding the history and context and brand it for millions of dollars,"" he adds. The frustration, he says, is not focused on any one label but has been building for years. The most memorable misstep, according to him, took place during the Karl Lagerfeld ""Paris-Bombay"" Métiers d'Art collection, showcased in 2011. The collection featured sari-draped dresses, Nehru-collared jackets and ornate headpieces. Many called it a fine example of cultural collaboration, but others argued it relied heavily on clichéd imagery and lacked authentic representation of India. Others, however, say no brand can afford to write off India as insignificant. ""We might not be the fastest-growing luxury market like China, but a younger and more sophisticated generation of Indians with different tastes and aspirations is reshaping the landscape of luxury,"" says Nonita Kalra, editor-in-chief of online luxury store Tata CliQ Luxury. In the case of Prada, she says the brand seemed to have made a ""genuine oversight"", evident from the lengths to which it has gone to rectify its mistake. For Ms Kalra, the problem is a broader one - where brands based in the west and run by a homogenous group of people end up viewing consumers in other parts of the world through a foreign lens. ""The lack of diversity is the biggest blind spot of the fashion industry, and brands need to hire people from different parts of the world to change that,"" she says. ""But their love and respect for Indian heritage is genuine."" The question of cultural appropriation is complex, and the debates it sparks online can seem both overblown and eye-opening. And while there are no simple answers, many feel the outrage around Prada has been a great starting point to demand better accountability from brands and designers who, until now, have largely remained unchallenged. It is an opportunity for India, too, to reflect on the ways it can support its own heritage and uplift it. Weavers toil for weeks or months to finish one masterpiece, but they often work in precarious conditions without adequate remuneration and with no protection for their work under international intellectual property laws. ""We don't take enough pride and credit our own artisans, allowing others to walk all over it,"" Ms Vasudev says. ""The trouble also is that in India we have simply too much. There are hundreds of different craft techniques and traditions - each with its constantly evolving motif directory going back centuries,"" says Laila Tyabji, chairperson of Dastkar, which promotes crafts and craftspeople. ""We bargain and bicker over a pair of fully embroidered juthis (shoes) but have no issues over buying a pair of Nike trainers at 10 times the price - even though the latter has come off an assembly line while each juthi has been painstakingly and uniquely crafted by hand,"" she says. And while that continues, she says, foreign designers and merchandisers will do the same....","A recent controversy surrounding Italian luxury label Prada has put the spotlight on how global fashion giants engage with India - a country whose rich artistic traditions have often suffered because of its inability to cash in on them.

mov_E5231A270BBCF114FD0CBFB1A38BCA07,"  A recent controversy surrounding Italian luxury label Prada has put the spotlight on how global fashion giants engage with India - a country whose rich artistic traditions have often suffered because of its inability to cash in on them. Prada got into trouble in June after its models walked the runway in Milan wearing a toe-braided sandal that looked like the Kolhapuri chappal, a handcrafted leather shoe made in India. The sandals are named after Kolhapur - a town in the western state of Maharashtra where they have been made for centuries - but the Prada collection did not mention this, prompting a backlash. As the controversy grew, Prada issued a statement saying it acknowledged the sandals' origins and that it was open to a ""dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans"". Over the past few days, a team from Prada met the artisans and shopkeepers in Kolhapur who make and sell the sandals to understand the process. Prada told the BBC that it held a ""successful meeting"" with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture, a prominent industry trade group. The statement also indicates that Prada may potentially collaborate in future with some manufacturers of Kolhapuri footwear. While it's not clear what form this collaboration may take, it's a rare example of a global fashion giant acknowledging that it failed to credit local artisans and the craft it was piggybacking on. Many big brands have been routinely accused of drawing inspiration from Indian, and wider South Asian, traditions in their quest to reinvent and stay relevant - but without crediting the source. Earlier this year, spring designs from Reformation and H&M ignited a fiery debate on cultural appropriation after many said that their outfits appeared heavily inspired by South Asian garments. Both brands issued clarifications - while H&M denied the allegations, Reformation said its design was inspired by an outfit owned by a model with whom it had collaborated for the collection. And just two weeks ago, Dior was criticised after its highly-anticipated Paris collection featured a gold and ivory houndstooth coat, which many pointed out was crafted with mukaish work, a centuries-old metal embroidery technique from northern India. The collection did not mention the roots of the craft or India at all. The BBC has reached out to Dior for comment. A team from Prada met makers and sellers of Kolhapuri sandals this week [ANI] Some experts say that not every brand that draws inspiration from a culture does so with wrong intentions - designers around the world invoke aesthetics from different traditions all the time, spotlighting them on a global scale. In the highly competitive landscape of fashion, some argue that brands also don't get enough time to think through the cultural ramifications of their choices. More in Business But critics point out that any borrowing needs to be underpinned by respect and acknowledgement, especially when these ideas are repurposed by powerful global brands to be sold at incredibly high prices. ""Giving due credit is a part of design responsibility, it's taught to you in design school and brands need to educate themselves about it,"" says Shefalee Vasudev, a Delhi-based fashion writer. Not doing so, she adds, is ""cultural neglect towards a part of the world which brands claim to love"". Estimates vary about the size of India's luxury market, but the region is widely seen as a big growth opportunity. Analysts from Boston Consulting Group say the luxury retail market in India is expected to nearly double to $14bn by 2032. Powered by an expanding and affluent middle class, global luxury brands are increasingly eyeing India as a key market as they hope to make up for weaker demand elsewhere. But not everyone shares the optimism. Arvind Singhal, chairman of consultancy firm Technopak, says a big reason for the seeming indifference is that most brands still don't consider India a significant market for high-end luxury fashion. In recent years, many high-end malls with flagship luxury stores have opened up in big cities - but they rarely see significant footfall. ""Names like Prada still mean nothing to a majority of Indians. There is some demand among the super-rich, but hardly any first-time customers,"" Mr Singhal says. ""And this is simply not enough to build a business, making it easy to neglect the region altogether."" Many big global labels have opened up showrooms in Indian cities in recent years [BBC] Anand Bhushan, a fashion designer from Delhi, agrees. He says that traditionally, India has always been a production hub rather than a potential market, with some of the most expensive brands in Paris and Milan employing Indian artisans to make or embroider their garments. ""But that still does not mean you can just blatantly lift a culture without understanding the history and context and brand it for millions of dollars,"" he adds. The frustration, he says, is not focused on any one label but has been building for years. The most memorable misstep, according to him, took place during the Karl Lagerfeld ""Paris-Bombay"" Métiers d'Art collection, showcased in 2011. The collection featured sari-draped dresses, Nehru-collared jackets and ornate headpieces. Many called it a fine example of cultural collaboration, but others argued it relied heavily on clichéd imagery and lacked authentic representation of India. Others, however, say no brand can afford to write off India as insignificant. ""We might not be the fastest-growing luxury market like China, but a younger and more sophisticated generation of Indians with different tastes and aspirations is reshaping the landscape of luxury,"" says Nonita Kalra, editor-in-chief of online luxury store Tata CliQ Luxury. In the case of Prada, she says the brand seemed to have made a ""genuine oversight"", evident from the lengths to which it has gone to rectify its mistake. For Ms Kalra, the problem is a broader one - where brands based in the west and run by a homogenous group of people end up viewing consumers in other parts of the world through a foreign lens. ""The lack of diversity is the biggest blind spot of the fashion industry, and brands need to hire people from different parts of the world to change that,"" she says. ""But their love and respect for Indian heritage is genuine."" Prada's toe-braided sandal - which strongly resembles the Indian Kolhapuri - was showcased in Milan last month [Reuters] The question of cultural appropriation is complex, and the debates it sparks online can seem both overblown and eye-opening. And while there are no simple answers, many feel the outrage around Prada has been a great starting point to demand better accountability from brands and designers who, until now, have largely remained unchallenged. It is an opportunity for India, too, to reflect on the ways it can support its own heritage and uplift it. Weavers toil for weeks or months to finish one masterpiece, but they often work in precarious conditions without adequate remuneration and with no protection for their work under international intellectual property laws. ""We don't take enough pride and credit our own artisans, allowing others to walk all over it,"" Ms Vasudev says....","A recent controversy surrounding Italian luxury label Prada has put the spotlight on how global fashion giants engage with India - a country whose rich artistic traditions have often suffered because of its inability to cash in on them.

Ini bukan sembarang mode karena menandai debut rancangan Jonathan Anderson, direktur kreatif baru Dior.  Melansir Marie Claire, Kamis, 17 Juli 2025, Anderson dan tim menghabiskan waktu lebih dari 100 jam untuk membuatnya, karena mereka melipat setiap bahan untuk rok dengan tangan. Satu bagian rok ini dibuat tetap datar, sebuah gambaran yang jelas dari sudut pandang Anderson yang tidak biasa terhadap bentuk klasik. Foto-foto di balik layar memperlihatkan rok pannier hoop di atas salah satu pinggul, sementara yang lain dibiarkan tanpa rok dalam. Atasan bertali spageti Jisoo BLACKPINK tampak sangat cantik, dengan pita tebal di atas satin monokrom. Namun, Anderson sedikit memiringkan pita tersebut, mirip dengan bagaimana ia melapisi dasi jas di atas kerah yang tersorot pada koleksi busana pria Spring 2026. Untuk bagian aksesori, Jisoo menambahkan sentuhan grunge pada pakaian femininnya dengan sepatu bot setinggi lutut dari studio Prancis dengan harga 2,2 ribu dolar AS (sekitar Rp35 juta). Sepatu ini terbuat dari kulit mengkilap dan memiliki tumit tebal, cocok untuk menunjang penampilan panggung idola berusia 30 tahun tersebut. Pemilik nama Kim Jisoo ini jadi duta global Dior untuk mode dan kecantikan pada Maret 2021. Sejak itu, ia dikenal sebagai ""Human Dior"" karena sering mengenakan barang label tersebut. Hubungannya dengan Dior tampaknya tetap kuat di era Anderson, dengan Jisoo menulis di unggahan Instagram-nya, baru-baru ini, ""Tidak sabar untuk mengenakan lebih banyak gaya."" Pelantun lagu FLOWER ini tidak pernah melewatkan pesta Dior selama masa jabatan mantan direktur kreatif Maria Grazia Chiuri. Ia telah menghadiri setiap peragaan busana sejak September 2021, sambil membintangi berbagai kampanye mode dan kecantikan. Baru-baru ini, Jisoo mengamankan tempat duduk di barisan depan untuk presentasi Dior Fall/Winter 2025. Sebelum pertunjukan, ia melambaikan tangan pada para penggemar, mengenakan blus putih berkorset, rok hitam berenda, dan sepatu bot bertali. Jisoo memiliki tas D-Journey, D-Motion, dan D-Vibe, tapi saat itu, ia membawa tas Lady Dior yang langka. Jisoo adalah penggemar berat Dior seumur hidup, terlepas dari siapa yang memimpin. Ia kemungkinan besar sudah mengonfirmasi kehadirannya di peragaan busana wanita perdana Anderson pada Oktober 2025. Tampilan Jisoo di panggung baru-baru ini menggenapi kebahagiaan BLINK, sebutan penggemar grup tersebut. Setelah penantian yang terasa seperti selamanya, keempat personel BLACKPINK akhirnya kembali beraktivitas sebagai grup. Ini bukan sekadar konser comeback biasa. Mengutip Times of India, Jumat (18/7/2025), BLACKPINK merupakan girl group K-pop pertama yang tampil di Stadion Goyang, Korea Selatan, dengan 78 ribu penggemar hadir selama dua malam pertunjukan. Jumlah ini mencetak rekor jumlah penonton terbanyak yang pernah dicapai artis K-pop mana pun. Jumlah itu lebih banyak daripada jumlah penonton di beberapa kota. Tiga hari setelah konser, tepatnya pada 8 Juli 2025, Jisoo membagikan perasaannya di media sosial. Ia menulis, ""Terima kasih pada semua BLINK dan semua yang telah bergabung dengan kami untuk menyambut awal musim panas yang hangat! Tur Dunia DEADLINE Dimulai!! Kami kembali!"" Namun, yang benar-benar menyentuh hati semua orang adalah pesan spesialnya untuk para penggemar di seluruh dunia. Foto-foto yang dipublikasikannya adalah potret yang membuat penggemar bahagia, seperti  momen di panggung, foto candid di ruang ganti, dan foto-foto panggung epik yang membuat Anda ingin berada di sana. Dari gaun mini uniknya yang bertali hingga busana panggung yang anggun, Jisoo menampilkan penampilan yang sangat baik.

mov_1AC0A931F3C2FC93F52212F7399E3B1A,"  It has been a busy year for the luxury world. Arguably, it has been an even busier year for me. While I am still processing this life parenthesis, it is time to get this blog back on track. Indeed, I took the decision to carve more time to go back to what I like most: art and fashion. To start off this come back, I want to discuss the arrival of Jonathan Anderson at Dior. In early June, JWA was confirmed at the helm of one of my favorite luxury houses. This applies to both men and women. Kim Jones (formerly doing Dior Men) and Maria Grazia Chiuri (Women) will be missed, and I cannot wait for their future endeavors. Similarly, JWA will be dearly missed at Loewe which skyrocketed both culturally and commercially under his leadership. Let's see what the future holds for the Madrid Maison. Hôtel des Invalides, Courtesy Dior JWA is not new to the intersection of art and fashion. He collaborated with numerous contemporary artists while at Loewe: Lara Favaretto, Lynda Benglis or Anthea Hamilton are among my favorites. He gave them a stage. But this time, his approach is slightly different. At Loewe, Anderson had almost a cultural blank state in terms of references beyond the house codes. This was despite Loewe being the oldest fashion house of the LVMH group. But Dior comes with a rich history and cultural capital. A series of star designers before him have built on this. And in fact, the fashion, the communication, and the staging of the Men's show were about inspirations and references, not getting contemporary artists under the spotlight. « When I thought about how to expand the horizons of the Maison, I thought about Christian Dior, whom, after the Second World War, looked back to the past to create the New Look » said Anderson. Yet, the subversiveness of JWA's style transpires in the designs, showing his willingness to bridge tradition and modernity. Dior Men by Jonathan Anderson, Courtesy Numéro Magazine The fashion is where this tension is the most prominent. The Dior Delft dress and its folds inspired a wide androgynous pair of shorts. The collars on straight shirts were purposely crooked while perfectly ironed. Ties were mixed with Canadian tuxedos. Delicate flowers adorned heavy Irish-inspired knits. Bows and jellyfish-leather shoes flirted and traditional tailcoats cohabited with chunky sneakers. Soft pinks and grey hues, among Mr. Dior's signature colors, sprinkled the looks through the show. References to traditional inspirations went beyond the house of Dior with tote bags referencing Dracula by Bram Stocker (1897), Les Liaisons dangereuses by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos (1782), Bonjour tristesse by Françoise Sagan (1954) and a sentence Dior by Dior. Maybe a wink at the storytelling abilities of a designer who was as much of an artist as a publicist. Jean-Michel Basquiat by Andy Warhol, 1982, © Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat.

mov_2B9B7A85FC20F32BFF32228A2AB64ED3,"  Zepto co-founder Aadit Palicha last week announced the 10-minute delivery for luxury cosmetic brands-- Estée Lauder's M.A.C., The Ordinary and Clinique--on the platform. From discounted offerings to previously elusive luxury and global brands, e-commerce and quick commerce platforms are witnessing a multifold surge in beauty and skincare product sales amid soaring demand. In fact, capitalizing on this trend, Zepto co-founder Aadit Palicha last week announced the 10-minute delivery for luxury cosmetic brands-- Estée Lauder's M.A.C., The Ordinary and Clinique--on the platform. After observing a surge in demand for existing beauty brands like Maybelline, Lakmé, and Faces Canada, Mamaearth, Renee, Swiss Beauty, and SUGAR Cosmetics, Zepto decided to expand its portfolio by including luxury brands as well, to offer users a wider range of options, said Devendra Meel, Chief Business Officer at Zepto. According to a report by Bengaluru-based consultancy firm Redseer, India's beauty industry is expected to reach $34 billion by 2028, driven by rising disposable incomes, increased consumer aspirations, and the influence of social media and e-commerce. Highlighting changing consumer behaviour, Amazon Beauty, Director Siddharth Bhagat told Storyboard18 about a strong shift towards tech-enabled, trend-led and personalised experiences for the cosmetics and skincare products. He said that faster deliveries, influencer-driven discovery, and the rise of D2C and international brands are further fueling the momentum. ""Amazon has witnessed a 12x growth in cosmetics due to the recent success of newly launched brands in 2025,"" Bhagat added. Nykaa, the pioneer in building a beauty-centric digital commerce platform, said its beauty business has grown 25 percent on a year-on-year basis, recording a revenue of Rs 7,251 crore for fiscal year 2025. Nykaa's beauty vertical includes e-commerce, physical retail, its house of brands, as well as an eB2B business. Nykaa's closest competitor, Myntra, has also ramped up its beauty segment on the platform to capitalise on the demand. Deepak Joshi, Senior Director - Category Management, Beauty and Personal Care, Myntra said the platform's dedicated 'Beauty' segment has outpaced the online beauty market by two-fold, registering more than 50 percent consistent year-on-year increase in monthly active users. ""Currently, Myntra Beauty boasts more than 2,900 brands,"" Joshi added. 'Tier-2 demand surge' Industry experts have acknowledged that tier-2 cities have emerged as a crucial market for platforms, driving demand for both affordable and premium cosmetics and skincare products. Meel from Zepto said that while quick commerce has largely remained metro-centric, traction for beauty products has notably increased in Tier-2 cities as well. Myntra's Joshi also noted that nearly half of the beauty buyers on the platform come from tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Besides, He also mentioned that Myntra's quick commerce service, M-Now, witnessed a 1.4x spike in demand for beauty products on Mother's Day in 2025. Notably, Vishal Chaturvedi, Vice President, The Body Shop, Asia South, said that quick commerce has delivered exceptional results for the company, almost doubling its growth compared to last year. ""Our specially curated selection of packed gift boxes and mini packs has seen strong sales on the quick commerce platform,"" Chaturvedi said. 'Rise of K-Beauty' In the competitive beauty market, digital commerce platforms have expanded their portfolio by adding luxury and premium beauty offerings, particularly Korean beauty (K-beauty) brands. According to the Amazon spokesperson, the K-Beauty category on the platform has witnessed a 75 percent year-on-year growth. According to Bhagat, K-beauty products primarily resonates with urban and digital-savvy women, aged between 20 and 35 years. ""The urban women have embraced K-beauty products to a larger extent, especially from cities like Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Pune"". Moreover, women from tier-2 cities are also exploring the K-beauty products through trial SKUs like sheet masks and minis, he added. Bucking the trend, Bhagat said Amazon has observed that a rising cohort of male consumers are also experimenting with Korean skincare, particularly around functional solutions like cleansers, serums, and sunscreens. A range of K-beauty brands have entered into Indian market via digital commerce platforms, such as COSRX, Laneige, and Beauty of Joseon, TIRTIR, Medicube, and Skin1004. Meanwhile, Myntra said that they have witnessed a 150 percent YoY growth in K-beauty category. Beyond K-beauty, several international luxury beauty brands are also capturing Indian consumers' attention through digital channels. Nykaa has a dedicated segment, called Nykaa Luxe, which offers a wide range of cosmetics and skincare products from luxury brands such as Armani beauty, Chanel, L'Oréal Luxe, Eucerin, Dior, Tom Ford, sol de janerio, among others. The company noted that the average annual spend by its top 10% customers is $395 on premium beauty products. Following suit, other platforms like Tira and Tata CliQ have also expanded their beauty portfolios. Myntra's quick commerce venture also offers a selection of international and premium beauty brands, including YSL and Estee Lauder. A report by global consultancy firm Kearney underscored that the luxury beauty accounts for about 4 percent share of the overall beauty and personal care market. In contrast, developing Asian peers, such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia, see luxury beauty holding a 20-25 market share.
