mov_D0B92F8FAF1CDDEFA7165705DDD75DB3,"  Princess Charlotte made her third Wimbledon appearance this weekend, alongside Prince William and Princess Kate. Her outfit especially stood out: a white frilled dress with black piping, which subtly matched a look worn by her mother in 2022. But this was not just a case of twinning; the outfit was a carefully styled nod to Kate's past wardrobe, her designer relationships, and even Charlotte's own personality. From the bespoke dress to her silver charm bracelet, nearly every detail of Charlotte's ensemble carried a deeper reference or sentimental value. Custom dress with Royal history Charlotte's white summer dress was custom-made by Sarah Burton, the designer responsible for Kate's 2011 wedding gown. It featured soft frill detailing at the hem and precise black V-line stitching. These are design elements closely resembling a certain white Emilia Wickstead dress Kate wore at the Guards Polo Club in 2022. Burton, now at Givenchy, also dressed Kate in a dark red gown at a State Banquet earlier this month. Her recent involvement with both royals hints at a growing fashion mentorship between Kate and her daughter. For footwear and accessories, Charlotte wore Camilla Elphick flats and Finlay & Co sunglasses, another overlap with Kate's past Wimbledon appearances. Charm bracelet with personal touches Charlotte's silver Pandora bracelet added more clues. One charm was set with a green stone—her May birthstone—while another was a miniature Nala from The Lion King, possibly referencing her known love for animated films. The third charm was a silver heart paired with an engraved disk. Though the inscription wasn't readable, it appeared to be custom-made. The disk likely contains a message from or about someone close to her, given that Pandora's official listings state that the charm is meant for a “personal stamp” or “message for someone special.” ALSO READ: IN PICS: Preity Zinta and Gene Goodenough enjoy Wimbledon date, Sara Tendulkar has a fun day with family","Princess Charlotte made her third Wimbledon appearance this weekend, alongside Prince William and Princess Kate.

mov_3669BA82B1B3CD13C135502499F3F431,"  LVMH shareholders have endured a torrid 2025 so far, with the French luxury group's stock market value sinking by a quarter over the last six months. The group, which counts Louis Vuitton, Dior and Givenchy among its stable of fashion brands, has seen shares sink by almost a third over the last 12 months as the global luxury rebound has probed sluggish. Last week Louis Vuitton announced it was targeted by a cyberattack for the third time in the past three months at the beginning of July, after Marks & Spencer, the Co-op and Harrods were all targeted earlier this year. Meanwhile, LVMH's drinks division, Moët Hennessy, is being gripped by a €1.3million court case brought by Maria Gasparovic, former chief of staff to executive Jean-Marc Lacave, who was sacked four months after reporting alleged sexual misconduct by senior colleagues. Despite these recent tribulations for the firm, analysts think shares could be due a rebound. LVMH revenues contracted 3 per cent to €20.3billion in the first quarter, from €20.7billion a year ago, well below analyst forecasts for sales growth of 2 per cent. Revenue in the firm's wines and spirits division, headed up by its Moët and Hennessy brands, declined 9 per cent to €1.3billion. Its largest category, fashion and leather goods, saw sales fall 5 per cent to €10.1billion, from €10.5billion previously. The firm, which was the first in its sector to post figures after the Donald Trump's 'liberation day' tariff announcements, said: 'In a disrupted geopolitical and economic environment, LVMH remains both vigilant and confident at the start of the year.' The French firm, which has a market capitalisation of almost €250billion, owns 75 luxury brands. It will publish its results for the first half of its 2025 financial year on 24 July. It isn't just LVMH that is feeling the pinch, the entire luxury sector is facing a similar downturn. After a post-pandemic peak that saw luxury brands surge on the back of huge demand, external pressures such as geopolitical uncertainty and economic slowdown have precipitated a downturn across the sector. During the course of 2024, the market dipped from €369billion to €364billion, according to figures from Bain & Company, with weaker demand, especially from China and the US, pushing the shrink. American luxury demand was down around 10 per cent in 2024 compared to its peak in 2022, according to data from Morningstar, while Chinese demand has slipped a quarter in compared with its pre-pandemic high point. Even so, LVMH has suffered a worse fate than many, with the firm underperforming luxury peers. Morningstar analysts said LVMH is currently trading below the broker's value estimate of €620 per share. At midday on Thursday, LVMH shares were trading at €496.05 per share. Since January, LVMH shares have fallen some 34 per cent, and was surpassed in value by Hermes, which became the largest luxury goods firm in April. Morningstar says this is a normalisation after the post pandemic boom, during which the firm said LVMH's valuation was stretched. At the time, LVMH was operating on a price to earnings ratio of 26. Now, having seen its share price half, its PE ratio on a one year rolling basis now stands at 20.2, according to figures form Stockopedia. In comparison, the new king of luxury, Hermes, is operating on a PE ratio of 50.8. Likewise, a number of other luxury goods firms have significantly larger PE ratios than LVMH, with Burberry standing at 48.2, EssilorLuxotica at 33.1 and Kering at 26.7. Jelena Sokolova, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said: 'We have seen luxury sector slowdowns many times before, but this time LVMH's valuation has been unfairly hit. 'The retailer is trading at its lowest forward earnings multiple in seven years and roughly half that of comparable wide-moat peers, which presents an opportunity for investors.' Morningstar added: 'Forward earnings multiples are at the lowest for the last seven years and are meaningfully below peers, offering around 30 per cent upside to our fair value estimate.' However, others argue that LVMH's downturn is far from an unfair reflection on the rest of the business. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, however, told This is Money: 'LVMH has lost its sparkle after a series of setbacks in recent years. It has focused too much on the aspirational market and these types of buyers have become more cash-conscious, watching their pennies rather than opening their wallets without a care in the world. 'In contrast, Hermes has explicitly focused on the ultra-rich and has enjoyed more resilient trading. LVMH might now be thinking hard about narrowing its customer focus as that could help to make its products more desirable, which is ultimately what luxury goods is all about.' LVMH still has exceptional brand strength, which Morningstar says will give it the edge against its peers. The group's brands making up 29 per cent of the luxury leather market, compared to just 8 per cent for Hermes. The firm's impressive storefronts and higher capital spending on retail may help its brands to stand out from their competition. The strength of the brand remains, with LVMH having seen fashion and leather sales grow slightly better than the wider sector last year, though this dipped in the first quarter of 2025. Coatsworth, however, said: 'LVMH has too many different interests. We're in an environment where companies are focusing on what they do best and jettisoning non-core assets. LVMH would be better if it just focused on fashion and got rid of the Sephora and DFS retail arms and its various food and drink operations.' LVMH's brand strength, unwieldy though it may be, could combine with the potential for an upswing in the sector after the slowdown of the past few years. Morningstar's Sokolova certainly thinks this is the case. She told This is Money: 'We expect the luxury industry to return to growth after the current - and last year's - slowdown, driven by normalisation of demand in the US as post-pandemic excess spending is flushed out - a trend we've seen since 2023 - and as Chinese real estate prices stabilize, boosting consumer sentiment. ' LVMH derives around 24 per cent of its sales from the US, where consumer sending has also stalled. Morningstar said: 'We estimate that post-pandemic excesses have been flushed out of the market, US luxury consumption should come back to growth from more normal levels. We expect US GDP to hold up stronger in the long term.' China accounts for a significant portion of LVMH's sales, with Asia (excluding Japan), accounting for 30 per cent of LVMH sales. China's economy is currently in a period of slow growth, with consumers remaining tight on spending. In the first quarter, LVMH revenue from China fell by 11 per cent, with the second quarter expected to follow suit. Sokolova said: 'Many Chinese spenders are still sitting on substantial savings following the pandemic. We expect LVMH to outperform the industry growth longer-term thanks to strength of the brands and substantial marketing budget....","LVMH shareholders have endured a torrid 2025 so far, with the French luxury group's stock market value sinking by a quarter over the last six months.

mov_C80B78691005640E32368BB7B77ABC7E,"  Meryll Rogge takes over at Marni, halting a backward trend. In the latest move in the unprecedented realignment of the fashion world, Meryll Rogge was appointed creative director of Marni on Tuesday. She will be responsible for women's wear, men's wear, accessories, store design and communications, replacing Francesco Risso, who left the Italian brand last month after almost 10 years. Ms. Rogge is the 17th new designer named to a big brand since mid-2024, but only the fourth woman. It's a striking imbalance in an industry that is still largely powered by women's wear and accessories, and one that was quick to pay lip service to diversity in recent years but has seemed to retreat from many of its pledges in terms of gender and race. Ms. Rogge will become the sole female designer in the stable of OTB, the holding company that also owns Maison Margiela, Jil Sander, Diesel and Viktor & Rolf and that reported sales of 1.7 billion euros in 2024, down 4 percent from 2023. Similarly, Louise Trotter, who will make her debut at Bottega Veneta in September, is the only female fashion designer at Kering, the luxury group that owns Gucci, Balenciaga and Saint Laurent, among other brands. The other two women who became creative directors of major fashion houses this year are Sarah Burton at Givenchy and Veronica Leoni at Calvin Klein. In a news release, Stefano Rosso, the Marni chief executive, called Ms. Rogge ""an exceptional creative talent and an inspiring woman."" A Belgian designer who started her career at Marc Jacobs before becoming head of women's design at Dries Van Noten and founding a namesake brand in 2020, Ms. Rogge, 40, shares a certain quirky practicality with Marni's founder, Consuelo Castiglioni. It was Ms. Castiglioni who transformed her husband's family fur company into a runway name beloved of bohemian intellectuals and art gallerists with a messy bent. In 2012, OTB bought a majority stake in the company, acquiring it fully in 2015. The next year, Ms. Castiglioni left, citing personal reasons, and Mr. Risso was named creative director. Though Mr. Risso's collections could be eye-poppingly imaginative, bristling with three-dimensional metal flowers or covered in what looked like finger paint, they could also seem self-indulgent - fun to look at but hard to wear. Ms. Rogge, who is relatively unknown outside the fashion world, became the first woman to be named designer of the year at the Belgian Fashion Awards in 2024 and was the recipient of the Andam Prize earlier this year, one of fashion's most prestigious awards. In explaining the selection, Guillaume Houzé, the president of Andam, cited Ms. Rogge's ability to turn ""ambiguity, hybridity and the unexpected into allies."" Like Ms. Castiglioni, she is also adept at marrying the conceptual to the commercial and has an affinity for color and the sort of print combinations that are alluring in their oddity. In the news release, Ms. Rogge called joining Marni ""both humbling and inspiring."" A spokeswoman for Marni did not specify when Ms. Rogge would unveil her first collection. She did say, however, that the designer planned to maintain her own line and split her time between the two brands.

Even if it was understandable, given what she had been through, and even if the report was later disputed by the palace itself, it sent tremors through the fashion-watching community. That was partly because the princess could change the fortunes of a designer or a brand simply by wearing a dress. And it was partly because she had long used her place in the attention economy to shine a light not just on British products, but on issues like sustainability by remaking and rewearing pieces from her closet, and even renting the occasional evening gown. Mostly, though, it was because the clothes are an expression of her role as a symbol -- of the country and that fine line between continuity and modernization. Stepping back from one suggested she was stepping back from the other. It's a weird thing to essentially be an avatar, but it's the job. As her appearance at the Wimbledon men's and women's finals, and at the French state visit, demonstrated, however, Catherine may be more selective about her appearances (she did skip Ascot), but she is no less strategic. She is simply being Catherine 3.0. There she was, after all, at the state visit, welcoming Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron in a blush-colored Dior suit with a New Look jacket and a skirt covered in net, just brushing her calves. The brand is both classic French and about to be led by a designer from Northern Ireland who was trained in Britain. It was a considered nod to political alliance (the kind she has practiced since marrying Prince William) that she repeated at the French state banquet, wearing a red Givenchy gown with a built-in cape sweeping down from her shoulders. It was regal, sure, but also strategic, given that Givenchy is now designed by Sarah Burton, the British designer who made Catherine's wedding gown and who has been her collaborator on numerous high-profile public occasions. Talk about entente. And there Catherine was at the Wimbledon women's final in a cream jacket and long pleated skirt, a coolly appropriate riff on tennis whites and her position as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club. So, too, the royal blue ankle-length Roksanda dress she wore to the men's final was perfectly coordinated with Prince William's blue blazer, Prince George's blue suit and Princess Charlotte's white dress trimmed in blue, all creating a literal picture of family unity. All demonstrating that Catherine is as attuned as ever to the role image-making plays in her job. That's not new. What is new, however, is the style in which she is doing it, and its consistency. Her skirts have gotten longer, her jackets more tailored, her silhouette more streamlined. The effect of dropping her hemlines even a few inches is both oddly nostalgic and sophisticated, gently protective. A reminder that she is dressing for the long game. Like the lanky pantsuits she had adopted for her everyday appearances, her style is shaping up as a new formula for dressing. As recognizable, in its own way, as the monochrome formula that served Queen Elizabeth II so well: shoes-to-coat-to-dress-to-hat in one shade. And it brings a new dimension to the symbolism inherent in Catherine's role. She is representing not just the next generation of the royal family, which itself represents tradition. She is representing the idea of elegance emerging from adversity, an idea that has both micro and macro associations. Who couldn't use some of that right about now?","Appearances at Wimbledon and a French state visit symbolize a new kind of style.

mov_BD15E6AF2E178969D175ED8CC1B4640F,"  KENT, OH. - The Kent State University Museum presents its summer exhibition titled Sparkle: The Style and Jewelry of Aileen Mehle. In honor of the Kent State University Museums 40th anniversary, this exhibition pays tribute to Aileen Mehle, a friend of the museum founders and widely syndicated society columnist. The exhibition features evening dresses and jewelry from Mehle that is being displayed in the museums historic Higbee Gallery from July 18, 2025, through Aug. 23, 2026. Aileen Mehle had so much taste and enthusiasm that it is fitting to pay tribute to her as we celebrate 40 years of the Kent State University Museum, stated Kent State University Museum Curator Sara Hume, Ph.D. Her career as a journalist attests to her brilliant wit and driving work ethic, yet she took extraordinary care in presenting herself appropriately for the variety of social occasions she reported on. She is an underappreciated style icon who is finally getting her due. Mehle, who lived from 1918 to 2016, wrote under the pseudonym Suzy Knickerbocker and enjoyed a career spanning five decades from the 1950s until her final column in 2005, which she wrote at the age of 87. This exhibition celebrates the sparkle of her style and the sparkle of her wit, Hume said. Mehle dressed in Pauline Trigère, Oscar de la Renta, Geoffrey Beene, Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy while wearing jewelry by David Webb, Cartier and Tiffany & Co. as well as bags by Judith Leiber and Bulgari. The exhibition features nearly two dozen vintage David Webb pieces. Aileen Mehle was the consummate David Webb collector: a self-assured woman of style who purchased countless treasures for herself and gave bejeweled gifts to her friends, noted Levi Higgs, David Webbs head of archives and brand heritage. Her records tell the story of a gregarious woman-about-town with impeccable taste and who embodied a bold and courageous sense of self-expression. Aileen Mehle was known for accessorizing her glamorous evening looks with dazzling statement jewelry, said Kent State University Museum Collections Manager/Registrar Joanne Fenn, who co-curated the exhibition with Hume. We are thrilled to debut her exceptional collection featuring work from influential jewelry designers such as Jean Schlumberger, Paloma Picasso, Bulgari and more. This exhibition promises to both inspire and engage students, offering a rare glimpse into the artistry and craftsmanship of these iconic creators. In an era before everyone could turn to social media to discover who was going where or who was seeing whom, Suzy, as Aileen Mehle was known to her devoted fans, kept us all abreast of the comings and goings as well as the juicy scandals of New Yorks social set, said Armand Limnander, executive editor of W. Her dazzling jewelry and clothing collection is testament to the time in which she lived and the world she inhabited. Among the approximately 20 dresses from the 1960s through the 1990s mounted in the exhibition is the beaded dress by Nilo de Paul that she wore to Truman Capotes Black and White Ball in 1966 alongside a selection of her jewelry that range from vintage earrings from the 1930s to statement necklaces and bracelets from the 1980s. Aileen aka Suzy moved in rarefied circles, or should I say, rarefied circles moved around Aileen. She was, in the years she wrote for WWD, almost always bedecked in frills and froth, sometimes with a boa wrapped around her, said James Fallon, chief content officer of Fairchild Media Group and WWD. But those soft outfits covered a steely reporter whose eyes never missed anything and whose ears heard every whisper of affairs, scandals and the latest social gossip. She was repeatedly asked to write a tell-all book about her life but would always respond that she knew too many secrets to tell them all. It is a cliché to say someone is one of a kind, but in Aileens case, there is no better description. This exhibition reflects the spirit of our 40th anniversary season honoring our history, showcasing our extraordinary collection and articulating a bold and engaging vision for our future, said Kent State University Museum Director Sarah Spinner Liska, Ph.D., J.D. The Sparkle: The Style and Jewelry of Aileen Mehle exhibition includes a specially designed installation an imagined, custom-built closet showcasing Mehles garments, offering an intimate and engaging glimpse into her iconic style.","KENT, OH. - The Kent State University Museum presents its summer exhibition titled Sparkle: The Style and Jewelry of Aileen Mehle.

Aileen Mehle had so much taste and enthusiasm that it is fitting to pay tribute to her as we celebrate 40 years of the Kent State University Museum, stated Kent State University Museum Curator Sara Hume, Ph.D. Her career as a journalist attests to her brilliant wit and driving work ethic, yet she took extraordinary care in presenting herself appropriately for the variety of social occasions she reported on. She is an underappreciated style icon who is finally getting her due. Mehle, who lived from 1918 to 2016, wrote under the pseudonym Suzy Knickerbocker and enjoyed a career spanning five decades from the 1950s until her final column in 2005, which she wrote at the age of 87. This exhibition celebrates the sparkle of her style and the sparkle of her wit, Hume said. Mehle dressed in Pauline Trigère, Oscar de la Renta, Geoffrey Beene, Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy while wearing jewelry by David Webb, Cartier and Tiffany & Co. as well as bags by Judith Leiber and Bulgari. The exhibition features nearly two dozen vintage David Webb pieces. Aileen Mehle was the consummate David Webb collector: a self-assured woman of style who purchased countless treasures for herself and gave bejeweled gifts to her friends, noted Levi Higgs, David Webbs head of archives and brand heritage. Her records tell the story of a gregarious woman-about-town with impeccable taste and who embodied a bold and courageous sense of self-expression. Aileen Mehle was known for accessorizing her glamorous evening looks with dazzling statement jewelry, said Kent State University Museum Collections Manager/Registrar Joanne Fenn, who co-curated the exhibition with Hume. We are thrilled to debut her exceptional collection featuring work from influential jewelry designers such as Jean Schlumberger, Paloma Picasso, Bulgari and more. This exhibition promises to both inspire and engage students, offering a rare glimpse into the artistry and craftsmanship of these iconic creators. In an era before everyone could turn to social media to discover who was going where or who was seeing whom, Suzy, as Aileen Mehle was known to her devoted fans, kept us all abreast of the comings and goings as well as the juicy scandals of New Yorks social set, said Armand Limnander, executive editor of W. Her dazzling jewelry and clothing collection is testament to the time in which she lived and the world she inhabited. Among the approximately 20 dresses from the 1960s through the 1990s mounted in the exhibition is the beaded dress by Nilo de Paul that she wore to Truman Capotes Black and White Ball in 1966 alongside a selection of her jewelry that range from vintage earrings from the 1930s to statement necklaces and bracelets from the 1980s. Aileen aka Suzy moved in rarefied circles, or should I say, rarefied circles moved around Aileen. She was, in the years she wrote for WWD, almost always bedecked in frills and froth, sometimes with a boa wrapped around her, said James Fallon, chief content officer of Fairchild Media Group and WWD. But those soft outfits covered a steely reporter whose eyes never missed anything and whose ears heard every whisper of affairs, scandals and the latest social gossip. She was repeatedly asked to write a tell-all book about her life but would always respond that she knew too many secrets to tell them all. It is a cliché to say someone is one of a kind, but in Aileens case, there is no better description. This exhibition reflects the spirit of our 40th anniversary season honoring our history, showcasing our extraordinary collection and articulating a bold and engaging vision for our future, said Kent State University Museum Director Sarah Spinner Liska, Ph.D., J.D.
