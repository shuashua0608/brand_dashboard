EAF08F5EC939AAFE9B96F88DE3FB95CB,"  MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage (I charge from £1,150 for mine). Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 (£19.55, www.amazon.co.uk), Olaplex No.8 (£22.40, www.sephora.co.uk) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer (£21, www.boots.com). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner (£27, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner (£26, www.harrods.com). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now £17.99, sha op.toni www.ndguy.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now £12, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo (£24.50, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment (£25). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

Nordstrom's 2025 Anniversary sale is basically the grand finale of the deal-packed month and will be live through Aug. 3. The Nordstrom Anniversary sale has been shoppable for select cardholders who get early access to the deals for a week now, but now it's open to the public. This is Nordstrom's biggest (and most anticipated) sale of the year—it's on par with their post-Thanksgiving deals. As per usual, Nordstrom's Anniversary sale catalog includes thousands of steep discounts across all categories, including designer clothing, luxury beauty exclusives, and elevated home decor staples from customer-favorite brands like La Mer, Barefoot Dreams, Allsaints, and Levi's, marked down up to 60 percent off. Plus, this year, Nordstrom has added over 100 new brands to the sale catalog that were off-limits in previous years, including Supergoop, Benefit, Osea, Moccamaster, Farm Rio, Naked Wardrobe, Proenza Schouler White Label, Cult Gaia, and L'Agence. Of course, there are also plenty of under $100 buys to score as well, including from brands like Augustinus Bader, Ugg, Spanx, T3, and New Balance.

Amazon Prime Day is over, but the new Black Friday in July tradition is still going strong. Nordstrom's 2025 Anniversary sale is basically the grand finale of the deal-packed month and will be live through Aug. 3. The Nordstrom Anniversary sale has been shoppable for select cardholders who get early access to the deals for a week now, but now it's open to the public. This is Nordstrom's biggest (and most anticipated) sale of the year—it's on par with their post-Thanksgiving deals. As per usual, Nordstrom's Anniversary sale catalog includes thousands of steep discounts across all categories, including designer clothing, luxury beauty exclusives, and elevated home decor staples from customer-favorite brands like La Mer, Barefoot Dreams, Allsaints, and Levi's, marked down up to 60 percent off. Plus, this year, Nordstrom has added over 100 new brands to the sale catalog that were off-limits in previous years, including Supergoop, Benefit, Osea, Moccamaster, Farm Rio, Naked Wardrobe, Proenza Schouler White Label, Cult Gaia, and L'Agence. Of course, there are also plenty of under $100 buys to score as well, including from brands like Augustinus Bader, Ugg, Spanx, T3, and New Balance. Items return to full price after Aug. 3, but in the past, popular items have sold out before the sale ends, so be sure to shop the sale ASAP.

This serum uses vitamin C, collagen, sodium hyaluronate, and lavender oil, all of which will help your skin look super glowy. Promising review: ""I ordered this product after a colleague had recommended it. I had developed some acne and scarring from wearing a face mask. Most of the acne was around my cheek area. Once masks weren't required anymore, I was a bit embarrassed by my skin's condition. I've only ever used face wash and didn't know the importance of moisturizing. This has helped clear up my skin and even it out. I've been using it for about four months now and only have very minimal scarring left. The price is worth it. I have actually been using it daily and use about 3–4 drops a day. Still have over half the bottle left. Definitely a good investment. It has a light fragrance and will help your skin look dewy without feeling oily."" —Lupita Luna Get it from Amazon for $31.50. 2. A skincare starter kit for those who need help setting up their routine. It comes with a gel cleanser, serum, and hydrating cream that'll help smooth your face and brighten it. It's glowy skin season, and there's no one I trust more for glowy skin than the Queen of Glow herself, J.Lo. Promising review: ""I usually don't order skin products from celebrities, but I happened to come across a review from a makeup artist who raved about this product. I decided to give it a try. These products are great. Leaves your skin soft and hydrated with a nice glow. Not greasy looking or shiny. I have applied foundation after applying, and it does not affect the foundation. Great product."" —christine Get the set from Amazon for $201. 3. A glowy sunscreen because once you start using this, you won't be able to stop (trust me, I know from experience.) Every single time I wear this glowy SPF, I instantly get a confidence boost, and everyone compliments me. I am a Glowscreen stan, I use this almost every day, and the amount of compliments I receive while wearing this are unreal. Like I said above, once I have this on, I feel like a glowing goddess, and it makes me want to do a mini photoshoot. So I hope it inspires you as much as it inspires me. Promising review: ""I have been on a search for a sunscreen that doesn't burn my eyes and skin, and I have finally found that with Supergoop. I don't wear much makeup on a daily basis, so this tinted sunscreen is what I use on the daily to give a tiny bit of glow. I actually went with the bronze because it is so sheer.

(Boots/Yahoo Life UK) No7 has just launched a new affordable skincare range, and I've spent weeks testing it to see if it's truly worth purchasing. The collection is called No7 Good Intent and comprises of eight products, all priced under £15, that promise a 'glass-skin' finish through items such as whipped cream cleansers, plumping jelly masks, and silky, soft milky toners, all packaged in very aesthetic pastel designs.

The new range has five categories, featuring products designed to cleanse, tone, treat, moisturise, and protect. It includes a cleansing balm, foam cleanser, milky toner, skin clarifying pads, skin calming pads, a nourishing mask, dewy moisturiser, and a glow-giving SPF, each providing radiance and hydration benefits. While No7 has focused on affordability, its lightweight and ultra-hydrating formulas, combined with premium packaging, make it look and feel far more expensive than it is. Plus, you can't beat its value for money, with the cheapest item being the Glow Guard SPF30 Suncream at just £7.95. I've tried a lot from No7 - I'm already a big fan of its best-selling Future Renew range, which uses peptides to combat skin damage and ageing, so I had high hopes when No7 Good Intent arrived at my door three weeks ago that I would love it just as much. I've thoroughly tested every product and here is my honest review, highlighting what truly deserves a place in your beauty routine and what you can confidently skip. No7 Good Intent review: What to buy and what to skip Boos 100100Expert Score This is a brilliant budget moisturiser, especially if you have oily, combination skin like me, which struggles with dehydration in the summer. I find my skin suffers in the heat, becomes congested from regularly wearing suncream, and feels too sticky if I use my richer creams that work well in winter. Going forward, I'm definitely repurchasing and sticking with this super affordable No7 gem. It's a lovely, lightweight gel formula packed with hydrating hyaluronic acid and camellia oil, leaving a radiant, yet not overly dewy finish. It absorbs quickly, so you can apply make-up immediately, without worrying about pilling. Locking in hydration, it also leaves skin feeling silky soft, and for a £14.95 moisturiser, it performs better than some more expensive options I've tried.

397059B84031EE2F45D751CA8833E1A2,"  by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage. Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 ((EURO)29.50, www.brownthomas.com), Olaplex No.8 ((EURO)29.50, www.arnotts.ie) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer ((EURO)24.45, www.lookfantastic.ie). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner ((EURO)31, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner ((EURO)30, www.boots.ie). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now (EURO)22.49, www.cloud10beauty.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now (EURO)14, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo ((EURO)28.20, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment ((EURO)28). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

So far my recent favorite is the HaruHaru Wonder Airyfit.

Photo-Illustration: The Strategist; Photos: Retailers Nordstorm's Anniversary Sale is one of my favorite sales of the year, so I went all in for today's end-of-week roundup. The beauty deals are always good, and you often find brands that don't get discounted throughout the year in the mix (like Natori, Bombas, and Ecco, to name a few). Speaking of beauty, we just got word that Ami Colé is closing down, so now's the time to stock up; its sale section is an extra 25 percent off until stock runs out. And if neither of those sales is for you, I found plenty more double discounts at Levi's, Madewell, Nordstrom Rack, and Anthropologie. Our best brief doesn't go on sale much, so I'd suggest stocking up while its 25 percent off. I finally hopped on the American Trench train and bought a pair of their socks a few weeks ago. I highly recommend; they're surprisingly breathable despite the thick sole and squishy upper part. This set of three is just $9 apiece. Sale items are an extra 40 percent off at checkout at Anthropologie. There are lots of options from Anthropologie's in-house lines, as usual, like this stretchy tank that's now $12. Sale styles are an extra 50 percent off at Levi's at the moment. If you must wear pants during the summer, I say go wtih the baggiest ones you can find — these Levi's are a strong contender. Another wide-leg, this time courtesy of Madewell, where lots of on-sale jeans are an extra 50 percent off with the code SUMMER. This is a good wash option if you don't want to pay hundreds for Japanese selvedge denim. These inky blue jeans since we wrote about them in March (a.k.a. Jeans Month) are also $50 — which is $7 cheaper than when I spotted them on sale last month. No code needed to score these jeans from Madewell's collection with Alexa Chung. Photo: Retailer Strategist contributor Sable Yong owns four pairs of these Gap jeans, which she says are, despite the semi-intimidating horseshoe shape, “casually flowy while not swallowing my footwear in their gaping maws.” If you're in the market for comfy shoes, the Nordstrom sale has quite a few options, like these unisex-fit dad sneakers from New Balance. Several actually cute Ecco sandals are on sale at Nordstrom, too, but you can also find the same discounts at Amazon and Zappos if you'd like two-day shipping. As for this heeled option, most sizes are $120 — but you're in luck if you're a size 10 to 10.5, because they're $88, a discount of 50 percent off! Everything in Camper's sale section is half off for members (which just requires you to sign up for emails). I'm eyeing these fisherman-esque sandals that have an especially cushy-looking sole. If you're looking for some non-basic swimsuits and coverups, Marie Oliver has some for up to 70 percent off. Continuing with some capsule wardrobe basics, this all-cotton tee is 40 percent off and comes in six nice neutrals. Two equally worthy denim shirts, depending on your wash preference. These unisex work shorts by Le Laboureur, a French family-owned brand that's been producing workwear since the 1950s, are over 40 percent off. They're made from cotton moleskin, a densely woven fabric with a sueded finish that develops a unique patina over time. We'll always recommend on-sale Supergoop! This three-pack of spritzable sunscreen is now just over $16 per bottle (normally $24). Under $100 La Mer alert! An excellent deal on Bathing Culture's moisture-trapping body oil. A nice-smelling natural deodorant that actually works, according to our associate editor Jeremy Rellosa. Sadly, Ami Colé is closing up shop. So its sale section, the Overflow Shelf, is an additional 25 percent off with the code OVERFLOW25. Grab the Telfar bag of lip gloss, a hydrating concealer, or a couple makeup brushes while you still can. Clearance items are an extra 25 percent off at Nordstrom Rack this weekend. I found some crazy-good deals on Hydro Flasks, like this 32-ounce bottle in white, indigo, and purple. (There's also one in teal on sale for $35.) Tekla who? Dorm essentials are 40 percent off at Urban Outfitters through the end of the weekend. I like this $41 cottage-inspired sheet set, which includes one pillowcase, a fitted sheet, and a flat sheet in the twin / twin XL size (bigger sizes come with two pillowcases). A huge step up from mesh laundry baskets. This is more apartment-y than dorm, but fun nonetheless. Finally, a fashion-forward apron. If you're shopping the Nordstrom sale, make sure to check out all the baby clothes on sale — there are a ton of cute onesies from brands we love like Magnetic Me and Pehr.

Bonus points: this one is portable, so you can carry it in your purse. Promising review: ""I travel frequently for work and keep this in my suitcase. Works great; I no longer carry a lint roller."" —Liza Przekop Get it from Amazon for $7.99 (available in four colors). 2. Vacuum up grease with dry shampoo because tbqh, it's been 84 years since your last proper shampoo. I Dew Care dry shampoo employs an effective trio of biotin, black ginseng, and root-boosting powder, and it comes in genius packaging with an attached puff for application that's as easy as dab, dab, dab. Pro tip: Apply just a bit of product, brush it out, and repeat. Putting too much product at once may lead to white residue. Promising review: ""I was looking for a dry shampoo that would be easy to use on the go for a trip I was taking. I had no issues taking this through TSA, and it was so easy to use on the go. You literally just pat the poof on your scalp and then rub the powder in. I do have black hair, so dry shampoo is usually very visible in my hair, but I didn't have a hard time. It did a really good job of soaking up all the oil and giving my hair volume. I'm not a fan of the price for the amount that you get, but it is lasting longer than I thought it would. I would definitely recommend and will purchase again."" —Teresa Get it from Amazon for $18. 3. If you only have five minutes to get dressed, throw on this tank and skirt set. It's the ideal duo for your next outing — whether that be a picnic, rooftop cocktail, or birthday party. Promising review: ""Purchased to wear to work with a soft pink blazer, and I got so many compliments. It looks way more expensive than what I paid. Great material, great color, and great fit. You can probably dress it down with flats also, but I wore heels."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $39.99 (available in women's sizes XS–XL and in 14 colors). 4. Condense your entire morning makeup routine with Maybelline Dream BB Cream, which hydrates, blurs pores, and evens out your overall complexion in a pinch (no more ""did I blend evenly?"" panic required). It also contains broad-spectrum SPF 30, i.e., you can rush out of the house knowing your complexion is simultaneously looking fresh *and* being protected. This lightweight product is great for normal and dry complexions, but may not be the perfect fit for oily skin. Promising review: ""So happy I finally found something that covers my rosy cheeks, blemishes, and large pores. I have combination skin: an oily T-zone but overall dry skin, and it works for my skin. The best part is that it has SPF 30 in it. My dermatologist does not stop stressing the importance of daily use of SPF on the face, so now I'm happy I can still cover up my pimples and protect my skin from harsh UV rays from the sun. It doesn't feel heavy on my face and doesn't make it look like I caked on a pound of foundation. I have used it for about three weeks already and have not noticed an increase in pimples or skin irritation."" —Davis Get it from Amazon for $7.99. 5. Here's a foolproof mathematical equation: tank or tee + wide-leg trousers = a chic everyday uniform. These are available in a slew of neutral colors (think: black, white, navy, dark green). And not only do these look chic, but they're a far cry in comfort from the stiff denim you're typically reaching for. Promising review: ""These have been my go-to pants since I received them! They look quite chic and tasteful....","Outfit headaches where? 1. Rely on this gel lint roller so you don't show up to that business meeting with a black blazer covered in pet fur. Bonus points: this one is portable, so you can carry it in your purse. Promising review: ""I travel frequently for work and keep this in my suitcase. Works great; I no longer carry a lint roller."" —Liza Przekop Get it from Amazon for $7.99 (available in four colors). 2. Vacuum up grease with dry shampoo because tbqh, it's been 84 years since your last proper shampoo. I Dew Care dry shampoo employs an effective trio of biotin, black ginseng, and root-boosting powder, and it comes in genius packaging with an attached puff for application that's as easy as dab, dab, dab. Pro tip: Apply just a bit of product, brush it out, and repeat. Putting too much product at once may lead to white residue. Promising review: ""I was looking for a dry shampoo that would be easy to use on the go for a trip I was taking. I had no issues taking this through TSA, and it was so easy to use on the go.

mov_79C4686A6D4004CF3871CFA02E032765,"  If you've fallen victim to bugs, stinky feet, sunburns, and any other summer woes, these products are here to save you. 1. A thermal phone case because your phone battery goes from 100% to 54% after being out in the hot sun for 30 minutes — and you haven't even used it. The chromium thermal barrier (similar to spacesuit technology!) will reflect 90% of the sun's rays, so the next time you want to take a quick selfie, you won't have to ""hot potato"" your phone. It works the same way to protect your phone in extreme cold, and it also provides excellent protection if your phone gets dropped or knocked over. Psst — you may have seen this on Shark Tank! Promising review: ""This is just what the doctor ordered for those who can't take their cell phones into their workplace. It works, as I can attest to that. When I put it away in the car before I go into work, it is at the mercy of the cold and heat. This pocket does exactly what it says it can do. It protects the cellphone from heat and cold. This is the slickest thing since sliced bread. It is worth the price for keeping my phone safe from the elements. I believe in it because in triple-digit heat, the phone is still touchable after you remove it, instead of being hot as hell. If that doesn't sell this, nothing will. Any naysayers shall be made into believers after they buy this. You can believe that. I do, and you can't fake reality. Take it from me, it works as advertised and it will save your cellphone from certain death from the elements."" —Mark Philpot Get it from Amazon for $34.99+ (available in three styles and two sizes). 2. And a phone umbrella that may look like just a novelty product at first, but it's actually pretty cool. Imagine being able to see your phone screen in the sun — with this adorable umbrella, you can! It'll shield your screen for better visibility, and reviewers also love using it for their Kindles! This may be the most genius summer product I've seen. Promising review: ""The inventor of this shade umbrella is a genius! A great way to see my phone when I'm at the pool. The umbrella provides shade for the entire phone. I have the giant iPhone Pro Max, and the full screen is shaded. I purchased 10 more of this shade umbrella to give as gifts. It's whimsical but gets the job done. No more squinting to see my phone screen when I'm out and about in the sun."" —Pam Kolnicki Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in 20 colors/styles). 3. And!!! A laptop tent if your laptop insists on overheating while you're working outside, even if you only have ONE tab open. (Like why?!) This nifty gizmo takes WFH to a new level. The reflective fabric prevents overheating and reduces sun glare from every angle so you'll ACTUALLY be able to see your screen. It can fit laptops up to 17 inches in diameter. It folds into its own carrying case with a handle and has pockets and openings on both sides! Promising review: ""I knew that this product was a great idea immediately after I saw the listing online. Having used it for a couple of days, I have to say that I am not disappointed. A few things I love about this product: 1. It allows me to work on my deck in the bright sun without my laptop being at maximum brightness.
