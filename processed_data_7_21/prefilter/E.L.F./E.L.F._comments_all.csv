The surprise album dropped on Friday, July 11, and features 21 songs. 'SWAG' quickly raced to #1 on Spotify and Apple's music charts. Several reports suggest it could secure 150,000 to 175,000 album equivalent units during its debut week. Morgan Wallen's 'I'm the Problem' dominates America's album chart. It has been at No.1 on the Billboard 200 for two months! Two songs on the album, 'Daisies' and 'All I Can Take', are also set for a big first week. 'Daisies' scored #1 on Spotify's U.S. and Global Song Debut charts while 'All I Can Take' claimed the #1 spot on Apple Music Song Debut charts. Several songs from the album will likely make it onto the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart, but it remains to be seen which one will top the chart. Alex Warren's 'Ordinary' is currently at #1.

Hailey recently sold the brand to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion in May. Reviews of Bieber's albums have been streaming in. Most fans are in love with the offering. ""Swag isn't just an album — it's Justin Bieber talking to his wife, his son, his real fans, and most of all, to himself,"" one fan wrote on X. ""It's him breaking free, saying whatever he wants. More than music, it's his declaration of independence."" Another X user said: ""Something I really love about Justin Bieber's album SWAG is how mature it is. It doesn't feel like an artist stuck in the past or an artist trying to make [TikTok] music two issue that [a lot] of 2010s artists are now struggling with."" However, some social media users gave it lukewarm reviews. ""So, like, this album is boring. The songs aren't necessarily bad but in terms of Justin, this is a chop.

1lzuzpa,"  I (23f) have been holding onto this for a few months to post so nobody would know it was me. It was a week day at the red ball store and I was only there that specific day because I had picked up a short shift to work in online order pickup. I had to go to the back room to grab an E.L.F. eyeliner for my batch that wasn't on the floor, but the convenient way off the floor was through a medium sized fridge room that's connected to the back instead of walking the entire length of the wall to the other backroom door. When I walked in, I saw them in the corner behind several large produce shipment boxes that had obviously been moved in there to conceal them. It was Kimberly (very late 20s f) and Dylan (19m). I'd seen them flirting a lot in the break room recently, so I guess it made sense. Unfortunately I saw, froze, and made an audible gasp, leading to them whisper-swearing, shuffling around to where I couldn't see anymore, pulling up his pants and acting like nothing happened, and they weren't there. They couldn't see me due to the boxes and the…position… they were in, but I could see them initially since I'm quite tall. I booked it out of there and to the eyeliner I needed for my order, and I did take the long way going back out, lol. I didn't know what to do for the rest of my shift, so I waited until I got home and finally decided to shoot an email to HR after discussing it with my best friend on facetime. I feel bad because it ultimately led to Dylan and another employee getting fired after they were caught by a team lead (who was specifically watching him for this reported behavior) in a different fridge behind a yogurt pallet a couple weeks later. Should I have just pretended I didn't see and not said anything? I feel guilty because it wasn't really my business, nobody was cheating, and generally I don't care about stuff like that, *but* it was pretty shocking to see at work and I was worried about minor TMs potentially walking in on that.","I (23f) have been holding onto this for a few months to post so nobody would know it was me.

I had to go to the back room to grab an E.L.F. eyeliner for my batch that wasn't on the floor, but the convenient way off the floor was through a medium sized fridge room that's connected to the back instead of walking the entire length of the wall to the other backroom door.

1m05fj8,"  **Note: I have already posted this in another makeup subreddit but barely got any advice. I'm hoping posting it here may help… I turn red in the face and I'm struggling to cover it up properly and effectively. So, for some context as to how this began: I started a medication last Christmas and with every medication comes their side effects as most would know. I didn't know that my medication would stop me from sweating as it was always cold in the house because it was winter, but once it started getting warmer, my face would turn red often even from the littlest bit of warmth. And I know some might say that's normal and unavoidable, but I've never had it happen as often and as severe as this. In previous years, including last year, my cheeks were the only part on my face that would frequently turn red from warmth. Nowadays, my medication causes my face to turn red when I'm even just a little bit too warm. The only way to help battle the redness without makeup (and also because I'm literally too overheated to function) is to cool myself down with air conditioning because nothing else helps. The reason I'm making this post is because I have been struggling with makeup lately to help cover up my redness (oftentimes before it happens), especially when I'm leaving the house. I've never turned this red before, and even if I did, it was usually only on my cheeks, not my entire face like it is nowadays thanks to the medication… I have dry and sensitive skin, and not a lot of products have worked for me, but for a couple months now, I have been using Jason Wu's Tinted Moisturizer Meets CC Cream and it's been the best base makeup product I've used in years! I've also switched from putting the green shade from the NYX Color Corrector palette all over my face (exhausting because it takes forever to work into the skin) to recently using Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (because I use their normal Age Rewind Concealer and I've loved it since forever). I have also purchased the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer since someone I know recommended it for my situation, but I haven't tried it yet since I don't understand how it helps… And no, this post isn't just me rambling about my struggles with makeup. I'm here asking for help from those who may have experience with these products, this situation, or those who have professional makeup advice for me. There's a few issues I've been having with my makeup lately: 1. I've found that sometimes touching my face will take my tinted moisturizer right off, or if my nail presses ever so slightly onto my skin, that it'll remove the makeup in that exact area. I've tried to combat this by setting my face with the only setting powder I own, which is one from E.L.F. I just don't remember the name. I've only done this method once and it seemed to have helped but I'm unsure about how much it helped. 2. If I don't apply enough of my chosen colour corrector (remember, I still haven't tried the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer yet) underneath my tinted moisturizer, then my redness will shine through later on and it makes me feel horrible about myself (I know many people have rosacea and other skin conditions that can cause mass redness, but I'm just remaining honest on how my type of redness makes me feel, so please don't take any offence as I don't mean any…). 3. To conclude this, I'm also heavily struggling with how to make this whole process simpler and less stress-inducing because I'm oftentimes trying to cover my redness before it actually appears, so I cannot tell how much green will help combat the red. Sometimes I've used too little and later my redness peeked through my makeup, or I've used too much and I've had to put on a lot of tinted moisturizer to cover it. It was also my first time using setting powder because I was scared it would cause me to dry out because of my skin type. I just need some advice… If anyone has any questions regarding what I mentioned, then please ask. I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions from anyone who is familiar with this or knows, professionally, how to help. I'm also on a tight budget as I barely make any money nowadays, so purchasing luxury beauty products or pricy items is something I'd very much like to avoid unless there's no other way. Sorry for this jumble of stuff. I've just been so frustrated lately and I've gotten very tired of spending a lot of time looking up how to help with these things and coming up with nothing, either because the advice found didn't help or wasn't the right solution to my problem. Thank you. ***TL;DR: I've been turning red in the face from a medication I take that stops me from sweating (meaning I cannot cool myself down).

mov_73E4ED1F1427B944611E55FC53EC0880,"  The beauty and personal care landscape continues to grow increasingly competitive in the advent of increased social selling, pushing industry stakeholders to pivot into increasingly creative, innovative efforts to reinvent category offerings. According to the recently released the new report by consumer insight firm NIQ, these efforts are paying dividends: e-commerce drove a 17.4% increase in beauty and health sales in 2024, with online now representing 42% of total category revenue. E-commerce, social selling, and the largest swing in category growth Among the trends tracked in NIQ's report, social media, wellness, personalization, and luxury, social media was highlighted as the most transformative force. “It's not just about visibility; TikTok is becoming a commerce channel itself,” said Anna Mayo, Vice President, Beauty Vertical at NIQ. Through “social selling (especially on TikTok Shop), rapid digital discovery, and retail consolidation around platforms like Amazon,” she told CosmeticsDesign USA, the beauty category has particularly benefited from the growing influence of impulse-driven purchases. As noted in NIQ's report, 68% of social buys are unplanned, with user-generated content as a main driver behind the conversion momentum. Leading beauty brands in this space, Mayo advised, are leveraging building blocks like “experiential digital storytelling, social-first product launches and agile fulfillment across platforms.” For example, brands such as e.l.f., Phlur, and Dove are developing launch strategies specifically tailored for social platforms. “This forces manufacturers to prioritize agility, trend responsiveness, and creator partnerships in product development and marketing,” she said. High-growth segments signal new consumer priorities The fragrance category was a notable outlier, according to the report, with a 20% year-over-year growth rate that was largely driven by viral trends and evolving consumer behavior, especially among Gen Z. For example, Mayo illustrated, “instead of having a signature scent, they are investing in a fragrance wardrobe, with scents for different moods and occasions, that can also be layered together.” Brands that are attuned to the demographic and behavioral shifts like this have responded by expanding hero fragrances into new product formats, such as body care, and intensifying social media campaigns. “With fragrance's emotional and identity-driven appeal, as well as its continued innovation in formats and storytelling, the category is well-positioned for continued growth,” she added. Several other emerging and previously underperforming segments also outpaced expectations in 2024. “Categories like first aid, lip care, and men's body care stood out with high-growth product launches,” she said. Products like Dr. Squatch lip balm and Band-Aid Pro Heal Bandages, for example, reflected a growing demand for “wellness-adjacent personal care” and innovation in functional and inclusive product design. Strategic innovation imperative for 2025 and beyond The impact of brand innovation, which the report noted contributed to nine percent of mass retail beauty sales, cannot be understated, said Mayo. Citing examples like Sol de Janeiro's Rio Deo and SheaMoisture's Even Tone Deodorant as evidence that consumers respond positively to new offerings from trusted brands, the data demonstrated that line extensions have been a successful endeavor for some beauty brands over the past year. “These cases show that consumers gravitate toward familiar, trusted brands offering new formats that match their values, whether that's wellness, inclusivity or luxury feel at mass price points,” she explained. However, she cautioned, while innovation is “a critical driver of brand growth, especially in times of economic uncertainty...the data shows that while line extensions dominate, not all innovation leads to incremental growth, so brands must be diligent in assessing whether new products are additive or potentially cannibalizing existing sales.” Ultimately, she concluded, “success will depend on staying agile, insight-driven, and culturally relevant, developing products that not only meet functional needs but also tap into emerging values and behaviors shaping the future of health and beauty.”","The beauty and personal care landscape continues to grow increasingly competitive in the advent of increased social selling, pushing industry stakeholders to pivot into increasingly creative, innovative efforts to reinvent category offerings.

This cult-classic, lightweight, slightly glossy shade is beyond ""holy grail"" status — it matches skin tones so beautifully that I'm personally starting to suspect witchcraft, after seeing so many TikToks of it subtly transforming entire beauty looks with just a few swipes. I was very adamant about not buying this for the longest time because I am stubborn about ""expensive"" beauty products, but this is worth every penny and then some. It's so lightweight and layerable, it's foolproof to apply, and I have yet to wear a single outfit it doesn't complement??? I love watching it instantly elevate a casual look or add simple elegance to dressy ones. I wear it every day now, and after weeks of use, I've barely made a dent. Also, and maybe this is just me, but I tend to get pigment on my teeth with a lot of lip products, and I've simply never had an issue with this magic stick. Anyway, watch this TikTok of someone using it on their lips AND cheeks, because I did and oops, this lipstick FELL into my cart. Promising review: ""I bought this on a whim and I loved it so much I went back and bought a few more so I could have one at the office, purse, etc. ... you never know when you need lipstick.

A hydrating E.l.f. lip balm which feels just as buttery soft as Laneige *and* has the same glossy finish to boot.

It's hydrating, lightweight, doesn't get sticky, and adds a perfect ~subtle~ gloss whether I'm using it alone or on top of a lip color. I love the vanilla flavor so much, it's got a similar vibe to the birthday cake flavor that Glossier sometimes carries."" Promising review: ""I have one in my car, one in my purse, and one at home.

mov_0A440AE19F198C9B6A9A0EFFB4306133,"  While most of us ditch our routine in the summer, I think I've found the product that's upped my makeup game Summer is hands down one of my favourite times of the year, mainly because I can skip the makeup routine, especially when a fresh tan gives that perfect sun-kissed glow. But let's be real: for those of us who feel a bit self-conscious about our skin, a little makeup can really help boost confidence while still keeping that holiday radiance alive. As someone with dry skin, finding a primer that doesn't cling to dry patches or add extra texture has always been a struggle. After a lot of trial and error, though, I think I've finally found the one: a lightweight, reliable primer that keeps my makeup in place all day and feels like second skin. Enter the Maybelline Grippy Serum. This product has completely revamped my makeup game, and it's super affordable too. At just £10 on Amazon, the combination of its ultra-blendable formula and Serum-To-Grip technology ensures your makeup stays put for up to 24 hours. It's a water-based primer that feels fresh and lightweight but never greasy, with zero white cast, making it suitable for all skin types. Plus, I find that it hydrates and plumps the skin, which creates the perfect base for makeup. Application is a easy too: simply apply a few drops with the dropper, then gently tap it in with your fingertips or a beauty blender. Within 20 seconds, the serum transforms into a grippy texture. What I love most is that as you apply your foundation, the primer gives your skin a natural, healthy glow, leaving you with a fresh, dewy finish, perfect for those summer nights. With the addition of 2% Niacinamide, it nourishes your skin while locking your makeup in place all day long, so you won't feel like it's just melting off. It's the ideal mix of skincare and makeup in one product. For money-saving tips, sign up to our Money newsletter here Indeed, lots of people on Amazon are finding similar results, with the product securing a strong 4.3 star rating. One customer shared: ""I actually love this, goes on really well and is nice and tacky in minutes. The added benefit of skincare is just an amazing quality. Foundation sits so well on top of this and lasts all day."" However, some people have pointed out that the primer may not be suitable for all, with one person saying: ""Lovely texture for more mature skin, was really excited to try this. Until I realised all of my foundations, tinted moisturisers and cc creams were silicone based and obviously water based primer repels silicone based formulas. So the makeup separated. It clearly says it in the title that it's water based, but I didn't realise that water and silicone don't play well."" If you're also a fan of silicone-based makeup and don't want to overhaul your entire makeup collection, LookFantastic offers the perfect solution: the NYX Professional Makeup Studio Perfect Primer - Clear. Priced at £10.99, this primer helps reduce unwanted shine and control excess oils while smoothing the skin for a flawless make up finish. More along the lines of the Maybelline Grippy Serum is the e.l.f. Power Grip Primer - a must try if you believe all the TikTok hype. Like the Grippy Serum, the formula goes tacky within 30 seconds, ensuring your makeup lasts all day long. Infused with hyaluronic acid, it moisturises, preps and smooths for a plump, flawless complexion. The best part? It's currently on sale at Amazon, dropping from £10 to £7.89.","While most of us ditch our routine in the summer, I think I've found the product that's upped my makeup game Summer is hands down one of my favourite times of the year, mainly because I can skip the makeup routine, especially when a fresh tan gives that perfect sun-kissed glow.

Application is a easy too: simply apply a few drops with the dropper, then gently tap it in with your fingertips or a beauty blender. Within 20 seconds, the serum transforms into a grippy texture. What I love most is that as you apply your foundation, the primer gives your skin a natural, healthy glow, leaving you with a fresh, dewy finish, perfect for those summer nights. With the addition of 2% Niacinamide, it nourishes your skin while locking your makeup in place all day long, so you won't feel like it's just melting off. It's the ideal mix of skincare and makeup in one product.

One customer shared: ""I actually love this, goes on really well and is nice and tacky in minutes. The added benefit of skincare is just an amazing quality. Foundation sits so well on top of this and lasts all day."" However, some people have pointed out that the primer may not be suitable for all, with one person saying: ""Lovely texture for more mature skin, was really excited to try this. Until I realised all of my foundations, tinted moisturisers and cc creams were silicone based and obviously water based primer repels silicone based formulas. So the makeup separated. It clearly says it in the title that it's water based, but I didn't realise that water and silicone don't play well."" If you're also a fan of silicone-based makeup and don't want to overhaul your entire makeup collection, LookFantastic offers the perfect solution: the NYX Professional Makeup Studio Perfect Primer - Clear. Priced at £10.99, this primer helps reduce unwanted shine and control excess oils while smoothing the skin for a flawless make up finish. More along the lines of the Maybelline Grippy Serum is the e.l.f. Power Grip Primer - a must try if you believe all the TikTok hype. Like the Grippy Serum, the formula goes tacky within 30 seconds, ensuring your makeup lasts all day long. Infused with hyaluronic acid, it moisturises, preps and smooths for a plump, flawless complexion. The best part?

The all-out celebration of women's sports will include thought provoking content sessions, live podcast tapings and a can't-miss industry after party co-hosted by the iconic New York City restaurant, Sei Less. Launched in 2024, iHeart Women's Sports has already made a significant impact in the women's sports media landscape. In just one year, iHeart has raised women's sports coverage from less than one percent in 2024 to more than 34 percent in 2025, reaching 89 million monthly listeners across nearly 500 broadcast radio stations. As women's sports viewership continues to rise, iHeartMedia has remained dedicated to ensuring fair representation in media, with 50 percent of all newly produced sports podcasts focusing on women's sports coverage. In the past year, 80 percent of iHeartMedia listeners ages 18-54 have said that women's sports are becoming more accessible. iHeart Women's Sports downloads are also in the top 10 percent of all iHeartPodcast downloads, further emphasizing the demand for this type of dedicated content. “I think we can safely say that women's sports is not just having a moment but rather is on a now-undeniable trajectory that has been building for years.

More details on “Fudd Around And Find Out” will be announced soon. Listen to the official trailer now HERE.

mov_71F997A4E99484BE53D89BE909FEA8B6,"  Prices on items like baby gear and home goods climbed at Walmart in recent weeks, while the cost of dozens of other products CNBC tracked remained the same. The trends are an indicator of where prices are changing, and aren't, as President Donald Trump's tariffs take hold. Nationwide inflation data has started to show tariffs hitting in some areas after months of mostly muted affects. Walmart, the largest U.S. retailer, said in May that tariffs would force it to raise prices on some items. SECAUCUS, N.J. — As customers walk the aisles of Walmart stores, there are some early signs that higher tariffs are changing pricing. The nation's largest retailer warned in May that it would have to raise prices for its shoppers as President Donald Trump's new duties drive up the cost of many imported goods. About two months later, some household items on Walmart's shelves have higher prices, according to a CNBC analysis. CNBC tracked prices of about 50 products across merchandise categories including apparel, electronics, toys and groceries over seven weeks at Walmart's Secaucus, New Jersey, location. About a dozen of the items CNBC followed increased in price during that time, including a frying pan, a pair of jeans and a car seat, according to the analysis. Many of those items are manufactured in countries that face significant tariff rates. Even in cases where prices on imported items increased, it's unclear if the moves were all or partly due to cost increases from tariffs. The price analysis offers a snapshot into what Trump's duties mean for consumers' wallets, a key concern since he started rolling out tariffs on dozens of U.S. trading partners earlier this year. While nationwide inflation data had seen a muted effect from tariffs in recent months, that showed some signs of changing in June. Though the consumer price index increased by 0.3% for the month and 2.7% year over year, the prices of tariff-sensitive segments like apparel and household furnishings rose at higher rates of 0.4% and 1%, respectively, from May. Walmart is a critical indicator of pricing trends for multiple reasons. It's the largest retailer in the U.S., a place where millions of Americans buy not only their regular groceries but also purchase furniture, shoes and other general items. It also explicitly warned that the tariffs were so high, it would be forced to raise prices. ""We're wired for everyday low prices, but the magnitude of these increases is more than any retailer can absorb,"" Chief Financial Officer John David Rainey said in an interview with CNBC. The discounter's comment sparked criticism from the White House, with Trump telling the company in a social media post to ""EAT THE TARIFFS."" Walmart is a single company. The store where CNBC tracked prices is one among more than 4,500 locations across the U.S., and its suppliers play a role in whether prices rise. Even so, the areas where CNBC saw price hikes at Walmart in many cases reflected trends in national data tracked by the government and research firms. It isn't just Walmart. Other retailers said this spring that they have raised or expect to hike prices, including Best Buy, Costco, Nike and E.l.f. Beauty. In a statement, Walmart said ""pricing fluctuations are a normal course of business and are influenced by a variety of factors."" ""We're committed to keeping prices as low as possible for as long as possible, including the over 6,500 rollbacks we're currently offering, in addition to managing inventory and reducing cost,"" its statement said. Where prices are changing — and staying the same Most of the items that CNBC tracked at Walmart stayed the same price. However, some products saw a noticeable increase. The price of a 12-piece set of pots and pans from Beautiful, a private-label kitchenware brand that's exclusive to Walmart and co-founded by Drew Barrymore, rose from $99 to $149. A 12-inch frying pan from Beautiful climbed from $24.97 to $31.97. In addition, the price of a Graco convertible stroller and car seat increased in price from $199.99 (then noted as a Walmart rollback, or limited-time discount from the $249 original price) to $299. Some items' packaging offered clues that tariffs could play a role in the hikes. The Beautiful pots and pans and Graco car seat are all made in China, according to labels on their packaging. Trump has put new 30% tariffs on goods imported from the country this year. Graco's parent company, Newell Brands, declined to comment on the price increase at Walmart. In its earnings call in late April, the company, which also owns Yankee Candle, Rubbermaid and other brands, said it has raised prices on its baby gear by about 20%. Most baby gear sold in the U.S. is made in China. The price of Levi Strauss Signature Jeans for Men increased by a dollar from $23.98 to $24.98 at the Secaucus Walmart, bringing it in line with the cost of similar women's jeans. On an earnings call in July, the company said it is absorbing some of the tariff costs and anticipates new duties will impact the business by $25 million to $30 million for the rest of the year, or 2 to 3 cents on earnings per share. Levi's CFO, Harmit Singh, told CNBC in an interview that most of Levi's goods come from countries like Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia. Goods from all of those countries currently face 10% tariffs, and Trump has proposed higher rates for some of those nations as of Aug. 1. Tags of the signature jeans sold by Walmart, which came in multiple styles and washes, said they were made in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Tanzania and Lesotho. Across retailers, prices have increased in some key categories, but their impact hasn't been as dramatic as some feared when Trump implemented new tariffs, said Marshal Cohen, chief retail advisor for Circana, a market research company that tracks consumer spending patterns across merchandise categories. Those items with elevated prices include coats and jackets, casual shorts, golf shirts, plush toys, and small household appliances, he said. Here's how much prices rose in some categories as of the week ended May 31, relative to the week ended March 8, according to Circana data: Juvenile products, cribs and furniture: +23 to 27% Polo or golf shirts: +21% Plush toys: +19% Casual dinnerware: +23%...","Prices on items like baby gear and home goods climbed at Walmart in recent weeks, while the cost of dozens of other products CNBC tracked remained the same.

mov_B5C4CA08A64A76DA30900E04180D60A1,"  “These young kids are fast, but they haven't made all the mistakes, and they're not scared yet.” This savage comment from Katherine Legge underlined her attitude towards her NASCAR Cup Series debut season. The British motorsports athlete has a rich experience, having participated in endurance classics like the Rolex 24 at Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring. That is why Legge endured the 'baptism of fire' in the Cup Series with a solid approach. A possible threat looming in her path was none other than Carson Hocevar. The 22-year-old sophomore driver has already ruffled the feathers of several Cup Series veterans this year. Katherine Legge may have been another one, but the 40-year-old racer handled it like an icon. Katherine Legge shrugged at the rabble-rouser Well, given Carson Hocevar's record, this can be a difficult thing to do. Encountering the No. 77 Chevrolet up close has led to crashes for Ryan Blaney, Ross Chastain, and Ricky Stenhouse Jr this season. All of them swore to get back at the Spire Motorsports driver who was particularly nonchalant about his actions. In last Sunday's Sonoma Raceway event, Hocevar crossed paths with Katherine Legge. The latter encountered a brake issue during qualifying, so she had to start last. During the race, her No. 78 Live Fast Motorsports crew had to warn her about Hocevar flying past her. “Watch the 77 here”, her crew chief said. Instead of dreading another rabble-rousing tactic, Legge had a smart response. In a recent episode of 'Rubbin is Racing', Large, Quigs, and Moonhead were discussing Katherine Legge's Sonoma race. Quigs at first highlighted the fact that stunned the NASCAR community recently. In four Cup races – Phoenix, Mexico City, Chicago, and Sonoma, Legge finished better than Carson Hocevar. Quigs said, “Katherine Legge has finished ahead of Carson Hocevar in all four Cup races she has qualified for.” Then he brought the spotlight to Legge's savage radio response to seeing Hocevar in Sonoma. She said, “What is he doing? …Looking for somebody to give him a decking. I don't think he wants to be the one starting a fight. I think even I could take him.” Eventually, Katherine Legge wound up finishing 31st, one spot ahead of Carson Hocevar. Although her best finish so far has only been 19th at the Chicago Street Race (the first top 20 finish by a female racer since Danica Patrick in 2018), Quigs lauded Legge for her lighthearted banter. “She said this just totally joking around with her spotter, but I kind of like it. You know, at some point, she doored Chase Elliott because he was, I guess, you know, racing her a little bit aggressively. I really don't care if Katherine Legge races again in the NASCAR Cup Series, but while she's here, at least she's having maybe a little bit of fun with it. So, congrats to her.” Clearly, Katherine Legge is attaining the respect of the NASCAR community, one step at a time. Presently, she is ready to take on a new challenge. Adding a new venue to her timeline When Katherine Legge first formulated her NASCAR schedule, people had many doubts. She was the first woman to run a NASCAR race since Danica Patrick. She was even apprehensive about the e.l.f. brand adorning her car with a pink shade: “Oh god, that's so cliché. Do we have to do a pink car?” Following her Phoenix start, Legge faced a backlash from fans for causing twin wrecks and ruining a rival's day. Legge was not spared from vulgarity and death threats for her start. Despite this, Legge doubled down on her effort and persisted. In the Chicago Street Race, she beat Corey Heim at qualifying and clinched a remarkable 19th-place finish. So now, she is ready for the next challenge. On Tuesday this week, the racer announced her plans to compete in the 2025 Brickyard 400. Katherine Legge already has experience at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, having run in the 2023 and 2024 Indy 500s. Now, she is excited to take it a notch further. “It's always an honor to drive at Indy, but having the chance to compete in both the Cup and Xfinity races thanks to Desnuda and Droplight is going to be epic. After racing in the Indy 500 in '23 and '24, I definitely felt a void not being there this year.” She added, “But adding races to my schedule is exactly what I've been working toward. Competing in as many events as possible and logging as many laps as I can.”...","“These young kids are fast, but they haven't made all the mistakes, and they're not scared yet.” This savage comment from Katherine Legge underlined her attitude towards her NASCAR Cup Series debut season.

mov_5C739BDA1778492665BB1429EBAA0B69,"  Some of the best growth stocks are in the consumer space, and with tariffs still very much front and center, many of these stocks remain well off their highs. Nibbling on these names, say with an initial $1,000 investment, can be a good place to start. Let's look at five consumer-focused stocks to buy now while they're still on sale. These are all solid companies with a lot of potential growth still in front of them. Image source: . 1. Amazon While Amazon (AMZN 0.39%) has rallied from its lows, the stock is still off its highs and attractively valued from a historical perspective. And if there were thoughts that tariffs were slowing consumer spending, the company just announced its largest ever Prime Day sales event. Expanded to four days, the company generated $24.1 billion in sales, according to Adobe Analytics. That's more than double the sales it saw last Black Friday. While Amazon showed it still has what it takes to drive retail sales, what's most exciting about the company is what is going on behind the scenes. Years of investment in logistics, automation, robots, and artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off, and making operations even more efficient. This is leading to cost savings and strong operating leverage. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market-share leader in cloud computing, where customers are using its services to build and deploy their own AI models and tools. It's also developed its own custom chips for training and inference, which gives it both performance and cost advantages. For long-term investors, Amazon is a great stock to own. 2. Alibaba Alibaba (BABA 1.29%) is a stock that remains on sale. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 11 times and has more than 30% of its market cap in cash and investments. The stock is not just cheap, but it's executing on multiple fronts. Its cloud business has now seen AI-related revenue more than double for seven consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, Apple's decision to use Alibaba's Qwen model to power Apple Intelligence in China could be a solid growth driver. The company's e-commerce business has also seen a solid turnaround. Alibaba invested to grow Taobao and Tmall's gross merchandise value, and now it's better monetizing its platforms through new software fees and AI tools. It's also just started with new initiatives to help further drive growth, including offering one-hour delivery and embedding shoppable Taobao links in posts on the popular Chinese Rednote app. In addition, the company continues to grow and scale out its international e-commerce segment, and it expects it to turn profitable soon. Alibaba is still in the midst of its turnaround story, and at its current valuation there's a lot of upside if it continues to execute. 3. E.l.f. Beauty A sudden slowdown in growth last quarter has put e.l.f. Beauty's (ELF 2.20%) stock on the sales rack. However, its pending acquisition of Rhode looks like it could be transformative. E.l.f. has already been one of the biggest winners in the mass-market cosmetics space, and now it's adding a fast-growing premium brand to its portfolio. Rhode generated $212 million in sales over the past year with barely any paid marketing, a limited product lineup, and selling only through its website. That's impressive. Rhode was already set to enter Sephora stores, and now e.l.f. will have the opportunity to plug Rhode into its existing retail relationships, including those with Ulta Beauty and Target, while ramping up product development and marketing. Hailey Bieber remains onboard as chief creative officer, which should help maintain brand momentum as the product line expands. The strategy is smart. Premium skincare brands such as Rhode are simply going to have better margins than mass-market color cosmetics. This is a big opportunity for the company going forward and a reason to own the stock long term. 4. JAKKS Pacific Toy company JAKKS Pacific (JAKK 1.13%) has quietly become one of the best turnaround stories in consumer products. Under CFO John Kimble — formerly of Mattel and Disney — the company has streamlined operations, improved operating margins, and returned to consistent profitability. Shares are up more than 200% over the past five years, but down 30% this year on tariff worries. The result is that the stock trades at just 8.5 times 2025 analyst earnings per share estimates and 6 times the 2026 consensus. And it's not like the company is struggling. Sales jumped 26% in Q1, fueled by licensed products tied to Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Disney's Moana 2. That momentum should continue with toy and costume launches tied to Dog Man, Minecraft, and Paw Patrol....","Some of the best growth stocks are in the consumer space, and with tariffs still very much front and center, many of these stocks remain well off their highs.

Alibaba is still in the midst of its turnaround story, and at its current valuation there's a lot of upside if it continues to execute. 3. E.l.f. Beauty A sudden slowdown in growth last quarter has put e.l.f. Beauty's (ELF 2.20%) stock on the sales rack. However, its pending acquisition of Rhode looks like it could be transformative. E.l.f. has already been one of the biggest winners in the mass-market cosmetics space, and now it's adding a fast-growing premium brand to its portfolio. Rhode generated $212 million in sales over the past year with barely any paid marketing, a limited product lineup, and selling only through its website. That's impressive. Rhode was already set to enter Sephora stores, and now e.l.f. will have the opportunity to plug Rhode into its existing retail relationships, including those with Ulta Beauty and Target, while ramping up product development and marketing. Hailey Bieber remains onboard as chief creative officer, which should help maintain brand momentum as the product line expands. The strategy is smart. Premium skincare brands such as Rhode are simply going to have better margins than mass-market color cosmetics. This is a big opportunity for the company going forward and a reason to own the stock long term. 4. JAKKS Pacific Toy company JAKKS Pacific (JAKK 1.13%) has quietly become one of the best turnaround stories in consumer products. Under CFO John Kimble — formerly of Mattel and Disney — the company has streamlined operations, improved operating margins, and returned to consistent profitability. Shares are up more than 200% over the past five years, but down 30% this year on tariff worries. The result is that the stock trades at just 8.5 times 2025 analyst earnings per share estimates and 6 times the 2026 consensus. And it's not like the company is struggling. Sales jumped 26% in Q1, fueled by licensed products tied to Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Disney's Moana 2. That momentum should continue with toy and costume launches tied to Dog Man, Minecraft, and Paw Patrol....",2025-07-18 09:41:33,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The comment discusses e.l.f.

mov_9CBB5B06146DA502DB5BE524AC35BE6C,"  The Seasons presents a sensory music journey that follows the life-changing music and moments of artists themed around a time machine. Airings at 11 p.m. on the 18th, KBS 2TV's The Seasons – Park Bo-gum's Cantabile features Super Junior, Sunwoo Jung-a, Paul Blanco, and Jisokuri Club, who each share their musical stories from their time. It is a warm journey that revisits life's moments that have served as the background of music, offering deep resonance to viewers. This broadcast also highlights Park Bo-gum's talents. With affectionate piano performances and questions that dig deep into the guests' music, he enriches the stage. The true value of Park Bo-gum's evolving musical entertainment shines in this broadcast, with witty ad-libs, clever hosting, and delicate empathetic remarks. Super Junior, the first Asian group to hold a solo concert in Saudi Arabia, reveals an incredible backstory, stating, ""We built the performance hall in a day and operated 200 air conditioners."" Despite concerns about whether their joints would hold up a decade ago, Super Junior brings 20 years of their debut onto the stage, wholly recalling the second generation of K-POP sensibilities. Notably, the stage for 'I Know,' composed by senior SM artist Kangta and prepared for the fandom E.L.F., will be unveiled for the first time. When Park Bo-gum confesses, ""I really liked the songs of K.R.Y (Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, Yesung) seniors because they aimed for old sentiments,"" the members react in surprise, saying, ""He's a rare young man. Could he really like a tragic group?"" Sunwoo Jung-a, who reappears after 18 episodes, humorously sets the stage with a flustered gesture at Park Bo-gum's surprise remark, ""I missed you."" She shares a candid behind-the-scenes story about her hit song 'Let's Run Away,' saying, ""It's a song I wrote after running away from home during a fight in my newlywed days,"" making the audience laugh and feel touched. On this day's broadcast, Sunwoo Jung-a mentions a song she'd like to sing directly for Park Bo-gum, creating an unexpected buzz in the venue. Accordingly, moments are expected where Park Bo-gum humorously quips, ""I'm sad, my own professor,"" eliciting laughter. The narrative of melancholy and recovery contained in her new album 'Chalan' will also be showcased in this broadcast. Paul Blanco, who appeared two years ago with long hair and a pink vest, returns to the KBS music stage. He reveals his reason for appearing, stating, ""I wanted to come back because the song I briefly performed here two years ago received a lot of love,"" adding, ""It was terrifying and nerve-wracking, to the extent I wanted to run away, but it was also a place that felt like a benefactor."" In fact, the video of 'That Kind of Thing,' sung by Paul Blanco, has garnered over 5 million views on the KBS official YouTube channel, creating a buzz. In response to Park Bo-gum's question about his real name, he reveals, ""Actually, my friends call me that because I look like 'Deoksu,'"" disclosing an unexpected nickname. He also humorously acknowledges that most of his album's title tracks are rated for mature audiences. Jisokuri Club, showcasing a unique genre called 'fishing pop,' expresses, ""I couldn't sleep thinking about meeting Park Bo-gum. We even fought over who would sit next to him,"" displaying their fandom. A member who attended the filming shares their overwhelming joy of being on stage, beginning a delightful time travel in the warm welcome of Park Bo-gum. A scene that catches the eye features Park Bo-gum being appealed to by the charm of fishing with the witty saying, ""Dopamine is seven times that of drugs and fishing is better than drugs."" A song reflecting the feelings of millions of ants who suffered losses in stocks evokes poignant empathy.

Beauty just made a transformative acquisition with Rhode. Cava has one of the biggest expansion opportunties in the restaurant space. Some of the best growth stocks are in the consumer space, and with tariffs still very much front and center, many of these stocks remain well off their highs. Nibbling on these names, say with an initial $1,000 investment, can be a good place to start. Let's look at five consumer-focused stocks to buy now while they're still on sale. These are all solid companies with a lot of potential growth still in front of them. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocksto buy right now. Continue Image source: Getty Images. 1. Amazon While Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has rallied from its lows, the stock is still off its highs and attractively valued from a historical perspective. And if there were thoughts that tariffs were slowing consumer spending, the company just announced its largest ever Prime Day sales event. Expanded to four days, the company generated $24.1 billion in sales, according to Adobe Analytics. That's more than double the sales it saw last Black Friday. While Amazon showed it still has what it takes to drive retail sales, what's most exciting about the company is what is going on behind the scenes. Years of investment in logistics, automation, robots, and  artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off, and making operations even more efficient. This is leading to cost savings and strong operating leverage. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market-share leader in  cloud computing, where customers are using its services to build and deploy their own AI models and tools. It's also developed its own custom chips for training and inference, which gives it both performance and cost advantages. For long-term investors, Amazon is a great stock to own. 2. Alibaba Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is a stock that remains on sale. It trades at a  forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 11 times and has more than 30% of its market cap in cash and investments. The stock is not just cheap, but it's executing on multiple fronts. Its cloud business has now seen AI-related revenue more than double for seven consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, Apple's decision to use Alibaba's Qwen model to power Apple Intelligence in China could be a solid growth driver. The company's e-commerce business has also seen a solid turnaround. Alibaba invested to grow Taobao and Tmall's gross merchandise value, and now it's better monetizing its platforms through new software fees and AI tools. It's also just started with new initiatives to help further drive growth, including offering one-hour delivery and embedding shoppable Taobao links in posts on the popular Chinese Rednote app. In addition, the company continues to grow and scale out its international e-commerce segment, and it expects it to turn profitable soon. Alibaba is still in the midst of its turnaround story, and at its current valuation there's a lot of upside if it continues to execute. 3. E.l.f.

mov_CDE1D311FBE394FAA4275BEB2FC22372,"  7 Beauty Products I Can't Survive Summer Without (Seriously, Take My Wallet) I really appreciate you checking out my blog! Just so you know, some of the links in this post are affiliate links. This means that if you buy something through them, I might earn a little bit of money, at no extra cost to you. There's absolutely no pressure to buy anything, but if you do, it genuinely helps support the time and love I put into writing these posts. Summer and I have a complicated relationship. I love the sunshine, the pool days, the iced coffees, and pretending I live in a Pinterest picnic. But I hate how my skin goes into oil factory mode, my makeup melts off faster than my motivation, and my hair turns into a fuzzball that could rival a lion's mane. Over the years, I've tried dozens of beauty products promising to “beat the heat,” but most of them let me down—like that one friend who always cancels last minute. So after way too much trial and error, I've found my ride-or-dies: 7 beauty products I literally cannot live without during the summer months. They're affordable, all on Amazon (because yes, I'm a Prime-addicted human), and they actually do what they claim. Let's get into it. 1. e.l.f. Power Grip Primer Buy on Amazon → Let me start by saying: this stuff is glue. In the best way possible. I used to skip primer because I thought it was a scam. But once summer hits and my foundation starts sliding off like it's auditioning for Cirque du Soleil, I need something to holdit together. This primer grips my makeup like it's its job (because it is) and gives me that smooth, hydrated finish without being greasy. Bonus: It feels just like a dupe for that expensive Milk Makeup one… but it's like $10. Win-win. 2. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Hyaluronic Acid Buy on Amazon → My skin gets confused in the summer. It's dry in patches, oily in others, and occasionally acts like it's mad at me for drinking iced coffee instead of water. This gel moisturizer saved me. It's light, cooling, and soaks in like a dream without leaving a film. I use it morning and night—and sometimes right after I come in from the heat, just to feel something soothing. It feels like giving my skin a tall glass of water. No breakouts, no sticky residue, just happy, bouncy skin. 3. NYX Bare With Me Concealer Serum Buy on Amazon → Foundation in the summer? No thank you. I'm not trying to bake a cake on my face. Instead, I've been living for this lightweight concealer serum. It's buildable, blends like a dream, and looks like skin—not like a mask. I use it under my eyes, around my nose, and on any little blemish trying to ruin my day. It doesn't crease, doesn't melt, and somehow makes me look like I actually slept last night. Which, spoiler: I didn't. 4. Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant Buy on Amazon → Let's talk clogged pores. Summer means sweat, sunscreen, and leftover makeup—and all that stuff loves to hang out in my pores like uninvited guests. I started using this exfoliant a few nights a week and noticed a huge difference. My skin looks smoother, my breakouts are way less intense, and those weird little bumps on my forehead? Gone. It's a holy grail product for a reason. Just make sure you wear sunscreen during the day (but you're already doing that, right? RIGHT?) . 5. Pacifica Underarm Deodorant Wipes Buy on Amazon → Okay, hear me out: I never thought I needed deodorant wipes… until I did. One day I was running late to a brunch, totally forgot deodorant, and grabbed one of these from my glove box out of desperation.

n3uc3ut,"  In terms of learning to paint your nails better, it all comes down to practice! [Here's an article with some tips & tricks from bloggers](https://www.nailcarehq.com/how-to-paint-nails) on how to paint your nails like a pro! You could also look up more videos on YouTube, as there are a ton of tutorials there as well! The main thing is learning polish control, making sure that there isn't too much polish on the brush but there's still enough that you can coat the entire nail without having to dip back into the bottle. This will come with practice & will change depending on the length of your nails. What I like to do is kinda wiggle the wand (what the brush is attached to) against the inside of the neck of the bottle to make sure there isn't a bunch of polish that's gonna drip down & then swipe most of the polish off one side of the brush. [Here's a little video to better explain!] (https://www.reddit.com/user/juleznailedithelps/comments/ka06vu/polish_control/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) When painting your nails, you're bound to end up with polish somewhere you don't want it to be. You can use a toothpick, a cuticle pusher, or anything small and pointed to kinda scrape the flooded polish out of your cuticles. After removing that excess polish, you can take a small brush (angled eyeliner brushes or small concealer brushes work great for this!) dipped in acetone to gently clean up any remaining polish on your cuticles. The $1 E.L.F. concealer/eyeliner brushes are a super popular option for clean up brushes! I also like to use a [dappen dish](https://www.sallybeauty.com/nails/acrylic-nails/glass-dappen-dish/SBS-154855.html) (you can also buy them on Amazon!) to pour my acetone into so I'm not having to dip into the big container of acetone (a few people have accidentally dropped their brushes in the bottle lol).","In terms of learning to paint your nails better, it all comes down to practice!

mov_C51F7BD90CFFA3B41A9B36434CA10BCB,"  ""I just wanna be a hot dad"" Last month, Rhode's new ""cover girl"" elicited a gasp in the Marie Claire office. Forget the women of the moment, Hailey Bieber's beauty brand tapped this year's hottest straight, male actor: Harris Dickinson, of Babygirl fame, to promote her new Glazing Mist. ""WHY WOULD A MAN BE THERE! [sic]"", wrote one Reddit user in response to the campaign on the forum ""LAinfluencersnark"", while another added, ""What does this have to do with skincare or make-up?"" Initially, yes, it raised an eyebrow coming from Rhode's strain of “clean girl” beauty, which is famed for birthing frivolous foodstuff-related trends, like 'glazed doughnut nails', 'latte make-up' and 'strawberry girl blush'. But really, tapping Hollywood in this way makes perfect sense for a brand that has always been ahead of the curve, as their recent $1 billion acquisition from e.l.f. Beauty proves. So, I wondered, was Rhode onto something more? Does Dickinson's appointment signal his demographic's growing interest in the industry? Mentally scanning my friendship group, I can see a real shift. Dipping a toe in beauty was once by way of brands like Bulldog, who strived to ""toughen"" up moisturiser so men and boys would actually use it—now, it's a rapidly growing market. Data from a recent YouGov BrandIndex shows that in the past four years, the skincare and cosmetics sector in Britain has grown exponentially amongst young men, aged 18-34, with 65 per cent of this cohort saying that looking physically attractive is important to them. You may like Indeed, one scan of the popular social satire Instagram accounts Socks House Meeting and Real Housewives of Clapton shows that the elevated man of today prizes his Malin+Goetz Peppermint Shampoo, Aesop Parsley Seed Cleanser and Haeckles Eco Marine Cream just as much as his Salomon trainers and the carabiner he hangs off his denim jorts. And even if the majority of men are not engaging in Patrick Bateman-level multi-step routines, they're making considered purchases, based on real research. When I ask London-based filmmaker Philip, 35, if he has had a growing interest in beauty, he replies, “Massively so. If anything, I have a suspicion of traditional men's grooming brands, unless it's high-end like Kiehl's—I rely more on what my girlfriend uses and recommends. It's not so much my age, it's growing awareness. I wish I had started putting effort in far earlier. I just want to age gracefully, and the big change has been understanding SPF. I don't want to damage my skin.” A friend who works in music PR, Henry, 29, tells me that his current skincare routine came from social media and getting closer to 30. “The algorithm is pushing a gym bro aesthetic that is relentless. My discover page is filled with hyper-masculine features and low body fat percentage, and I feel like I barely even interact.” He now buys curl creme and always keeps a “healthy stock” of The INKEY List moisturiser, caffeine eye cream, retinol and a tea tree face wash. “I have started [buying more beauty products in the past two years], mostly through word of mouth recommendations from female and male friends. Now that I'm almost pushing 30, I feel more of a need to take care of myself and my looks than ever, bizarrely. I think I just wanna be a hot dad.” For Philip and Henry, this shift has translated into regularly purchasing a few targeted skincare solutions to optimise or slow down age-related concerns, but other men are taking a different approach. Dr Tony Kaliya, the award-winning founder and medical director of the NEU Clinic (who is the expert behind my own Polynucleotide treatments), says there's been a definite uptick in straight men seeking cosmetic procedures, and that it increases year on year. Marie Claire Newsletter Celebrity news, beauty, fashion advice, and fascinating features, delivered straight to your inbox! By submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over. “What was once considered a female-dominated space is becoming far more gender-inclusive—men currently make up around 20–30% of my client base. Most are professionals aged between 30 and 55, although I've seen a rise in younger men coming in for preventative treatments. Once male patients start cosmetic treatments, almost all of them continue having more once they see the results.” Fellow aesthetics doctor and NHS GP, Dr Ahmed El Muntasar, agrees, saying that there's been a four hundred per cent increase in (mostly) straight men coming into his clinic for treatments. “Several factors contribute to this shift,” Dr Kaliya tells me. “Social media has played a huge role in normalising aesthetic treatments for men, and especially masculinising treatments such as chin and jawline filler. Increased visibility of male celebrities and influencers undergoing treatments has also helped break the stigma. And interestingly, the rise of high-definition Zoom calls during the pandemic made men more aware of their facial appearance, particularly lines and wrinkles, increasing the number seeking anti-wrinkle treatments such as Botox. There's also a growing cultural emphasis on optimisation—looking good is increasingly seen as part of performing well both professionally and socially.” And while the aesthetics doctor concedes that men have not faced the same scrutiny as women regarding appearance, the gap is closing, especially in competitive industries or highly visible roles. ""Men are expected to look youthful, energetic and well-groomed, and the ideal aesthetic has shifted too: strong jawlines, clear skin and well-balanced features are increasingly desirable. Most male clients aren't looking to look 'done' — they want to look like a more refreshed, well-rested version of themselves. Many are aiming to stay competitive in the workplace or dating scene without it being obvious."" As such, the most popular treatments amongst men, Dr El Muntasar explains, are collagen-stimulating treatments like Polynucleotides and JULAINE, dermal fillers for the under eyes, and Botox for fine lines and wrinkles. But ultimately, just as the beauty standard for women has grown exponentially since the advent of social media, it's having an effect on men too. Antonio, a photographer in his 30s, started getting Botox a few years ago, on top of overhauling his skincare routine to include SPF moisturiser, body oil and eye retinol. “I want to look a certain way to please myself in front of the mirror,"" he tells me.

If anything, I have a suspicion of traditional men's grooming brands, unless it's high-end like Kiehl's—I rely more on what my girlfriend uses and recommends. It's not so much my age, it's growing awareness. I wish I had started putting effort in far earlier. I just want to age gracefully, and the big change has been understanding SPF. I don't want to damage my skin.” A friend who works in music PR, Henry, 29, tells me that his current skincare routine came from social media and getting closer to 30. “The algorithm is pushing a gym bro aesthetic that is relentless. My discover page is filled with hyper-masculine features and low body fat percentage, and I feel like I barely even interact.” He now buys curl creme and always keeps a “healthy stock” of The INKEY List moisturiser, caffeine eye cream, retinol and a tea tree face wash. “I have started [buying more beauty products in the past two years], mostly through word of mouth recommendations from female and male friends. Now that I'm almost pushing 30, I feel more of a need to take care of myself and my looks than ever, bizarrely. I think I just wanna be a hot dad.” For Philip and Henry, this shift has translated into regularly purchasing a few targeted skincare solutions to optimise or slow down age-related concerns, but other men are taking a different approach. Dr Tony Kaliya, the award-winning founder and medical director of the NEU Clinic (who is the expert behind my own Polynucleotide treatments), says there's been a definite uptick in straight men seeking cosmetic procedures, and that it increases year on year.

By submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over. “What was once considered a female-dominated space is becoming far more gender-inclusive—men currently make up around 20–30% of my client base. Most are professionals aged between 30 and 55, although I've seen a rise in younger men coming in for preventative treatments. Once male patients start cosmetic treatments, almost all of them continue having more once they see the results.” Fellow aesthetics doctor and NHS GP, Dr Ahmed El Muntasar, agrees, saying that there's been a four hundred per cent increase in (mostly) straight men coming into his clinic for treatments. “Several factors contribute to this shift,” Dr Kaliya tells me. “Social media has played a huge role in normalising aesthetic treatments for men, and especially masculinising treatments such as chin and jawline filler. Increased visibility of male celebrities and influencers undergoing treatments has also helped break the stigma. And interestingly, the rise of high-definition Zoom calls during the pandemic made men more aware of their facial appearance, particularly lines and wrinkles, increasing the number seeking anti-wrinkle treatments such as Botox. There's also a growing cultural emphasis on optimisation—looking good is increasingly seen as part of performing well both professionally and socially.” And while the aesthetics doctor concedes that men have not faced the same scrutiny as women regarding appearance, the gap is closing, especially in competitive industries or highly visible roles. ""Men are expected to look youthful, energetic and well-groomed, and the ideal aesthetic has shifted too: strong jawlines, clear skin and well-balanced features are increasingly desirable. Most male clients aren't looking to look 'done' — they want to look like a more refreshed, well-rested version of themselves. Many are aiming to stay competitive in the workplace or dating scene without it being obvious."" As such, the most popular treatments amongst men, Dr El Muntasar explains, are collagen-stimulating treatments like Polynucleotides and JULAINE, dermal fillers for the under eyes, and Botox for fine lines and wrinkles. But ultimately, just as the beauty standard for women has grown exponentially since the advent of social media, it's having an effect on men too. Antonio, a photographer in his 30s, started getting Botox a few years ago, on top of overhauling his skincare routine to include SPF moisturiser, body oil and eye retinol. “I want to look a certain way to please myself in front of the mirror,"" he tells me.

mov_9DA69701F21B4EE9AC37DAB1FAFA4CE2,"  LOS ANGELES, July 19 — Hailey Bieber isn't letting her billion-dollar business success get caught up in husband Justin Bieber's old business drama. The model and entrepreneur clapped back at claims that the money she made from selling her skincare brand Rhode to e.l.f. Beauty had anything to do with her husband's financial dealings with former manager Scooter Braun. “The historic sale of Rhode is a huge accomplishment for Hailey and is completely separate from her husband and his business affairs,” her rep told Us Weekly yesterday. That statement came a day after TMZ reported Justin was allegedly holding off on paying back Braun's company, Hybe, until Hailey's massive Rhode deal went through. According to Us Weekly, the beauty brand sale, finalised in May, is worth up to US$1 billion (RM4.25 billion) —including US$600 million in cash, US$200 million in shares, and a potential US$200 million bonus if the brand meets certain targets. Hailey, 28, is still involved as chief creative officer and head of innovation. As for Justin, 31, he's said to have reached a US$31.5 million settlement with Braun for unpaid commissions and an advance tied to his cancelled Justice tour in 2022. He has yet to address the reports publicly. Braun and Justin officially ended their professional relationship in August 2023 after years of working together. Reflecting on the split during a June episode of the Diary of a CEO podcast, Braun, 44, said, “I understand, he probably wants to go on and show that he can do it. We worked together for so long and we had such extreme success... I think at this point that's what he's doing.” Justin, meanwhile, has kept a relatively low profile — until recently. Earlier this month, he surprise-released Swag, his first album in four years. The 21-track drop is more of a side project, according to Us Weekly, with a full-fledged pop record planned for early 2026. Even Braun gave the unexpected release his blessing, writing in an Instagram Story: “This is, without a doubt, the most authentically Justin Bieber album to date.” Despite the speculation and swirling headlines, Hailey's making it clear: her billion-dollar glow-up is all her own.","LOS ANGELES, July 19 — Hailey Bieber isn't letting her billion-dollar business success get caught up in husband Justin Bieber's old business drama.

mov_BE18076EF2AB75B4B8FD40C99C06CF84,"  by 19/07/2025 APEX / MEGA Justin Bieber, fresh off the release of his new album “Swag” and a series of carefully curated family photos, appears to be projecting an image of renewed confidence. However, beneath the surface, sources close to the pop star reveal a more complex reality: a struggle with persistent personal challenges, fluctuating moods, and growing tensions within his marriage to Hailey Bieber. The new album itself offers a glimpse into this internal conflict, featuring introspective interludes that feel strikingly candid, almost like therapy sessions laid bare. This vulnerability comes as Hailey Bieber's Rhode beauty brand experiences unprecedented success, recently securing a landmark $1 billion deal, adding another layer to the dynamic within the couple. Justin Bieber's Comeback: A Mask for Underlying Struggles? MEGA Released on July 11th, “Swag” was accompanied by a series of polished family portraits featuring Bieber, Hailey, and their 11-month-old son, Jack Blues. While the images portray a picture of domestic bliss, insiders suggest this carefully constructed facade may be concealing deeper turmoil. Reports indicate a pattern of increasingly frequent disagreements with paparazzi, subtle displays of friction between Justin and Hailey on social media, and erratic behavior in the months leading up to the album's launch. “He doesn't particularly handle [fame] well,” a source confided to Page Six. “Imagine being thrust into the spotlight at 14, constantly subjected to both adoration and intense scrutiny. It's a pressure cooker that breaks many people. I'm genuinely concerned for him.” Another celebrity insider echoed these concerns, stating Bieber “still has underlying issues” that continue to surface. Did You Know? : Justin Bieber first gained widespread recognition at the age of 15 after being discovered on YouTube by talent manager Scooter Braun. The Singer Gets Real About Fame, Family, and Finding His Way Raw Image LTD/MEGA Four years after the release of “Justice” and two years following the abrupt cancellation of his world tour due to health concerns, Bieber's latest project marks a shift in tone. Now a father, the 31-year-old artist presents a more subdued and introspective persona. The album notably features three interludes with comedian Druski, one of which, titled “Therapy Sessions,” provides a direct window into Bieber's struggles with public perception. “What's been a tough thing for me recently is feeling like I have had to go through a lot of my struggles as a human, as all of us do, really publicly,” Bieber shared during the interlude, with Druski acting as his counselor. “And so people are always asking if I'm OK, and that starts to really weigh on me. It starts to make me feel like I'm the one with the issues and everyone else is perfect.” Justin Bieber's Public Struggles, Marriage Woes, and a Family Under Scrutiny zz/XNY/starmaxinc. com/Newscom/MEGA A source familiar with Bieber's situation told Page Six that his recent social media posts have reflected a sense of frustration and inner turmoil. “If you have a friend and they're posting [like that] – I can tell he's angry just by looking at his posts,” the source explained. “He has mood swings – he's kind of an extreme personality in that sense.” The lyrics of “Walking Away” hint at potential strains in his marriage to Hailey, with lines like: “Days go by so fast, don't wanna spend them with you / So tell me why you're throwing stones at my back / You know I'm defenseless. Girl, we better stop before we say some sh–t / We've been testing our patience / I think we better off if we just take a break.” The couple has made concerted efforts to protect their son, Jack Blues, from the relentless glare of the paparazzi. However, some have questioned Bieber's decision to feature the 11-month-old on the album cover, even with his face obscured. “He obviously wants to protect his kid. But it's like 'Oh, we want privacy,' then they put the kid on album covers and books,” a celebrity insider observed. What do you think about the pressures of fame on young artists like Justin Bieber? And how can celebrities navigate the challenges of maintaining a private life while living in the public eye? With Hailey Bieber's Empire Rising, What's Next for Her Husband? MEGA Financially, the Bieber family appears secure, largely due to Hailey's thriving Rhode beauty brand. The company recently finalized a $1 billion deal with e.l.f. Cosmetics, including $800 million in cash and an additional $200 million contingent on future growth. This success has led to speculation about Justin Bieber's next move. The question of whether Bieber will embark on a tour to support “Swag” remains unanswered. Insiders suggest this decision is particularly significant given Hailey's company's rapid expansion. Those close to the singer believe a return to the stage could be beneficial for both his professional and personal well-being. “He needs to perform,” a celebrity insider stated....","by 19/07/2025 APEX / MEGA Justin Bieber, fresh off the release of his new album “Swag” and a series of carefully curated family photos, appears to be projecting an image of renewed confidence.

It starts to make me feel like I'm the one with the issues and everyone else is perfect.” Justin Bieber's Public Struggles, Marriage Woes, and a Family Under Scrutiny zz/XNY/starmaxinc. com/Newscom/MEGA A source familiar with Bieber's situation told Page Six that his recent social media posts have reflected a sense of frustration and inner turmoil. “If you have a friend and they're posting [like that] – I can tell he's angry just by looking at his posts,” the source explained. “He has mood swings – he's kind of an extreme personality in that sense.” The lyrics of “Walking Away” hint at potential strains in his marriage to Hailey, with lines like: “Days go by so fast, don't wanna spend them with you / So tell me why you're throwing stones at my back / You know I'm defenseless. Girl, we better stop before we say some sh–t / We've been testing our patience / I think we better off if we just take a break.” The couple has made concerted efforts to protect their son, Jack Blues, from the relentless glare of the paparazzi. However, some have questioned Bieber's decision to feature the 11-month-old on the album cover, even with his face obscured. “He obviously wants to protect his kid. But it's like 'Oh, we want privacy,' then they put the kid on album covers and books,” a celebrity insider observed. What do you think about the pressures of fame on young artists like Justin Bieber? And how can celebrities navigate the challenges of maintaining a private life while living in the public eye? With Hailey Bieber's Empire Rising, What's Next for Her Husband? MEGA Financially, the Bieber family appears secure, largely due to Hailey's thriving Rhode beauty brand. The company recently finalized a $1 billion deal with e.l.f. Cosmetics, including $800 million in cash and an additional $200 million contingent on future growth. This success has led to speculation about Justin Bieber's next move. The question of whether Bieber will embark on a tour to support “Swag” remains unanswered. Insiders suggest this decision is particularly significant given Hailey's company's rapid expansion. Those close to the singer believe a return to the stage could be beneficial for both his professional and personal well-being. “He needs to perform,” a celebrity insider stated....",2025-07-19 21:55:00,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The comment mentions e.l.f.
