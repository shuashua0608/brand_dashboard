mov_81422227036D91C8FD46BBC7501B3D0B,"  The best shampoos for dry hair can be total game-changers in your styling routine. Whether your hair is naturally dry or parched from excessive color treatments and heat styling, brittle strands are a stubborn bummer. And as you know by now, dryness doesn't discriminate—even oily scalps can lead to straw-like strands. Cherin Choi, a bicoastal hairstylist, emphasizes the importance of selecting a formula with ingredients that cater to the specific needs of dry hair, setting you up for long-term success. “Opt for shampoos containing nourishing oils, aloe vera, or hyaluronic acid to hydrate without weighing hair down,” she advises. That's why we combed through the backs of beloved bottles, checked in with experts to learn why they work, and made sure our editors gave them a good suds to see what the hype is all about. Our top pick was the HairStory New Wash, a lather-less shampoo (yes, that's right) that offers a milky cleanse hydrating enough to skip the conditioner if you please. Other options on this list will work overtime to repair your split ends, fight dandruff, and more. Best shampoos for dry hair, at a glance How we tested shampoo for dry hair AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron We tested shampoo for dry hair based on ingredients, texture, how well they lathered (and washed out), and how our hair felt post-wash and beyond. The best shampoos had ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides to deeply nourish, hydrate and detangle strands, and all gave us a nice thick and creamy lather. Finally, the ones that made this list kept our hair velvety smooth, flyaway and static free. Post two to three washes, our strands were soft, smooth and moisturized for days. Best Overall: New Wash by HairStory Courtesy of brand HairStory New Wash $46 Amazon Ingredient highlights: aloe vera leaf juice, evening primrose oil, sunflower seed oil Smells like: lightly floral Safe for color-treated hair: yes Size: 8 oz Hair Type: all While the idea of a non-foaming shampoo might raise an eyebrow (who doesn't love a rich lather?) , Hairstory's New Wash makes a compelling case. Too much foam can actually dry out your hair, which is why this formula transforms into a milky wash instead—cleansing, conditioning, supporting scalp health, and enhancing texture, all without harsh detergents. It's a favorite of Choi for good reason: it works on all hair types, plays nice with color-treated strands, and can even replace your conditioner if you're a one-and-done kind of washer. You're welcome to follow up with a conditioner, but we love the built-in convenience.

But take a deep breath—K18's Clarifying Shampoo might just be your hair's saving grace. It's a favorite of Choi and Ebony Knight, stylist and owner of Textured Press. “It's actually also a chelating shampoo, which means that it penetrates the outer layer of the hair shaft into the middle and removes metals and toxins—great for anyone who uses hard water to shampoo and condition hair,” Knight explains. “While this shampoo is suitable for all hair types, I found it to be extra useful for my fine hair, which tends to get oily at the root....","The best shampoos for dry hair can be total game-changers in your styling routine.
