1lzgi2e,"  This might be a dumb question, but the dilemma made no sense to me with the information about creatine and creapure i found online so i decided to ask here in case im missing something. I read that creapure is better than normal creatine but creatine is cheaper. I looked through a post about creatine in a subreddit about my country. Everyone said they sourced their creatine from this popular online shopping platform that's similar to amazon cause it was apparently the cheapest place. The website is selling optimum nutrition micronized creatine powder 300g for 36.80 dollars. But the decathlon in my country is selling creapure powder 300g for 24.90 dollars. Am i missing something obvious? Why did everyone in my country recommend to buy online when its clearly cheaper at decathlon? Is decathlon creapure considered bad or ineffective or something since its that much cheaper?","This might be a dumb question, but the dilemma made no sense to me with the information about creatine and creapure i found online so i decided to ask here in case im missing something.

I was in the same boat, “man I'm gonna go on a crazy cut, I wanna lose it all as fast as possible” (Maybe you're not thinking like that lmao who knows) But as someone who's been fat and is now fit my biggest piece of advice is to do a body recomp, which is losing weight through putting on muscle and losing fat. You can search up a calculator to figure this out since I'm not really sure the math behind it I never did this, and it was my biggest regret. First of all, get yourself some whey protein, Its like 40 bucks on amazon. I get “Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder, Double Rich Chocolate” Make sure you get a shaker bottle too with those little whisks balls in the cup The chocolate one tastes really good, but make sure you mix it with water, because mixing with milk is way too many calories. I like to have 2 scoops of protein powder in my drink, and I personally drink it 2 times a day Secondly, you're going to need to make an effort to EAT properly, get your protein in, try to eat your carbs at night, and get some health fats in. One great way to do this is by eating avocados, but don't eat too many because they are very calorie dense. 90% of getting built is made on your diet, and since you're going to be in a body recomp/cut, you're going to need to get accustomed to being hungry, and STANDING ON BUSINESS with your calories. At a minimum, find out the calories you SHOULD be eating for example 2300 calories a day, and count the calories you ACTUALLY eat, you will really be shocked once you start seeing what kind of shit you're eating, and it'll start a subconscious shift in your mind Also make sure get a gym membership, and go to the gym as frequently as possible, ideally 3-5 times a week, I like to use the push-pull-legs-push-pull-rest split, but that's just me AND MAKE SURE TO SHAVE THE BEARD. keep the goatee, but shave that fuckin Reddit beard that's coming in, I'm saying this out of love when I say that it does NOT look good, we've all been there.

mov_5025D84F9AE63522B9F3E7EE74ED15C8,"  SPR_COMBO[it]La creatina è uno degli integratori più utilizzati nel mondo del fitness e del bodybuilding. Nota per la sua efficacia nell'aumentare la forza e la massa muscolare, è anche oggetto di numerosi studi scientifici che ne confermano i benefici. Tuttavia, non tutte le forme di creatina sono uguali, e nemmeno le modalità di assunzione. In questa guida approfondita vedremo quale creatina scegliere , come usarla correttamente e quali effetti aspettarsi per ottenere il massimo sviluppo muscolare in sicurezza. Cos'è la creatina e come funziona nel corpo        La creatina è una molecola prodotta naturalmente nel corpo a partire da tre aminoacidi: arginina, glicina e metionina . Si trova principalmente nei muscoli, dove viene convertita in fosfocreatina , un composto che svolge un ruolo cruciale nella produzione di energia rapida (ATP) durante sforzi intensi e brevi, come il sollevamento pesi o gli scatti. Integrare creatina significa aumentare le riserve di fosfocreatina nei muscoli, permettendo di sostenere carichi di lavoro maggiori, stimolando più efficacemente la sintesi proteica e, nel tempo, la crescita muscolare . I benefici della creatina per l'aumento della massa muscolare     Ecco i principali vantaggi che rendono la creatina uno degli integratori più efficaci per l'ipertrofia:      Incremento della forza massimale e della potenza esplosiva    Maggiore volume di allenamento (più ripetizioni e serie)    Aumento della ritenzione intracellulare di acqua muscolare, che migliora l'anabolismo    Stimolazione indiretta della sintesi proteica grazie a sessioni più intense    Recupero muscolare più rapido tra una serie e l'altra     Quale tipo di creatina scegliere: le forme più diffuse a confronto     Non tutte le forme di creatina sono ugualmente efficaci. Vediamo le principali:         Conclusione : per la maggior parte delle persone, la creatina monoidrato (meglio se micronizzata ) resta la scelta migliore per rapporto efficacia/prezzo/sicurezza . Come assumere correttamente la creatina     Per sfruttare al meglio i benefici della creatina, è importante rispettare dosaggi e tempistiche adeguate. Esistono due approcci principali:     Fase di carico + mantenimento     Carico : 20 g al giorno divisi in 4 dosi da 5 g per 5–7 giorni    Mantenimento : 3–5 g al giorno per le settimane successive      Questo metodo accelera la saturazione muscolare ma non è obbligatorio. Potrebbero verificarsi gonfiore o disturbi intestinali nei soggetti sensibili. Assunzione costante     3–5 g al giorno, ogni giorno, senza fase di carico      Richiede circa 3 settimane per raggiungere la saturazione muscolare, ma è più tollerabile per molti. Quando assumere la creatina     Gli studi mostrano che l'assunzione post-allenamento , insieme a carboidrati e proteine, può ottimizzare l'assorbimento e favorire la sintesi muscolare. Consiglio pratico :  Prendi 3–5 g di creatina monoidrato dopo l'allenamento insieme a uno shake proteico o a una fonte di carboidrati semplici. Effetti collaterali, miti da sfatare e sicurezza    È pericolosa per i reni? Numerosi studi dimostrano che la creatina non danneggia i reni in soggetti sani. Chi ha problemi renali preesistenti dovrebbe consultare un medico. Fa ingrassare? No, ma può causare un leggero aumento del peso corporeo (1–2 kg) nelle prime settimane per effetto della ritenzione idrica intracellulare , un meccanismo favorevole alla crescita muscolare. Deve essere ciclizzata? Non è necessario interromperla ciclicamente. L'uso prolungato (fino a 5 anni) si è dimostrato sicuro e benefico se rispettati i dosaggi. Creatina e dieta: è sufficiente quella contenuta negli alimenti? Alimenti come carne rossa e pesce contengono circa 1–2 g di creatina ogni 500 g , quantità troppo bassa per raggiungere la saturazione muscolare senza integrazione. L'integratore è quindi altamente consigliato , specie per vegetariani e vegani che hanno livelli naturalmente più bassi. Con un uso costante e inserita in un contesto di allenamento strutturato e dieta iperproteica bilanciata , la creatina può diventare un alleato fondamentale per chi desidera sviluppare massa muscolare in modo efficace e sicuro .

Nota per la sua efficacia nell'aumentare la forza e la massa muscolare, è anche oggetto di numerosi studi scientifici che ne confermano i benefici. Tuttavia, non tutte le forme di creatina sono uguali, e nemmeno le modalità di assunzione. In questa guida approfondita vedremo quale creatina scegliere , come usarla correttamente e quali effetti aspettarsi per ottenere il massimo sviluppo muscolare in sicurezza. Cos'è la creatina e come funziona nel corpo La creatina è una molecola prodotta naturalmente nel corpo a partire da tre aminoacidi: arginina, glicina e metionina . Si trova principalmente nei muscoli, dove viene convertita in fosfocreatina , un composto che svolge un ruolo cruciale nella produzione di energia rapida (ATP) durante sforzi intensi e brevi, come il sollevamento pesi o gli scatti. Integrare creatina significa aumentare le riserve di fosfocreatina nei muscoli, permettendo di sostenere carichi di lavoro maggiori, stimolando più efficacemente la sintesi proteica e, nel tempo, la crescita muscolare . I benefici della creatina per l'aumento della massa muscolare Ecco i principali vantaggi che rendono la creatina uno degli integratori più efficaci per l'ipertrofia: Incremento della forza massimale e della potenza esplosiva Maggiore volume di allenamento (più ripetizioni e serie) Aumento della ritenzione intracellulare di acqua muscolare, che migliora l'anabolismo Stimolazione indiretta della sintesi proteica grazie a sessioni più intense Recupero muscolare più rapido tra una serie e l'altra Quale tipo di creatina scegliere: le forme più diffuse a confronto Non tutte le forme di creatina sono ugualmente efficaci. Vediamo le principali: Conclusione : per la maggior parte delle persone, la creatina monoidrato (meglio se micronizzata ) resta la scelta migliore per rapporto efficacia/prezzo/sicurezza . Come assumere correttamente la creatina Per sfruttare al meglio i benefici della creatina, è importante rispettare dosaggi e tempistiche adeguate. Esistono due approcci principali: Fase di carico + mantenimento Carico : 20 g al giorno divisi in 4 dosi da 5 g per 5–7 giorni Mantenimento : 3–5 g al giorno per le settimane successive Questo metodo accelera la saturazione muscolare ma non è obbligatorio. Potrebbero verificarsi gonfiore o disturbi intestinali nei soggetti sensibili. Assunzione costante 3–5 g al giorno, ogni giorno, senza fase di carico Richiede circa 3 settimane per raggiungere la saturazione muscolare, ma è più tollerabile per molti. Quando assumere la creatina Gli studi mostrano che l'assunzione post-allenamento , insieme a carboidrati e proteine, può ottimizzare l'assorbimento e favorire la sintesi muscolare. Consiglio pratico : Prendi 3–5 g di creatina monoidrato dopo l'allenamento insieme a uno shake proteico o a una fonte di carboidrati semplici. Effetti collaterali, miti da sfatare e sicurezza È pericolosa per i reni? Numerosi studi dimostrano che la creatina non danneggia i reni in soggetti sani. Chi ha problemi renali preesistenti dovrebbe consultare un medico. Fa ingrassare? No, ma può causare un leggero aumento del peso corporeo (1–2 kg) nelle prime settimane per effetto della ritenzione idrica intracellulare , un meccanismo favorevole alla crescita muscolare. Deve essere ciclizzata? Non è necessario interromperla ciclicamente. L'uso prolungato (fino a 5 anni) si è dimostrato sicuro e benefico se rispettati i dosaggi. Creatina e dieta: è sufficiente quella contenuta negli alimenti? Alimenti come carne rossa e pesce contengono circa 1–2 g di creatina ogni 500 g , quantità troppo bassa per raggiungere la saturazione muscolare senza integrazione. L'integratore è quindi altamente consigliato , specie per vegetariani e vegani che hanno livelli naturalmente più bassi. Con un uso costante e inserita in un contesto di allenamento strutturato e dieta iperproteica bilanciata , la creatina può diventare un alleato fondamentale per chi desidera sviluppare massa muscolare in modo efficace e sicuro .
