The surprise album dropped on Friday, July 11, and features 21 songs. 'SWAG' quickly raced to #1 on Spotify and Apple's music charts. Several reports suggest it could secure 150,000 to 175,000 album equivalent units during its debut week. Morgan Wallen's 'I'm the Problem' dominates America's album chart. It has been at No.1 on the Billboard 200 for two months! Two songs on the album, 'Daisies' and 'All I Can Take', are also set for a big first week. 'Daisies' scored #1 on Spotify's U.S. and Global Song Debut charts while 'All I Can Take' claimed the #1 spot on Apple Music Song Debut charts. Several songs from the album will likely make it onto the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart, but it remains to be seen which one will top the chart. Alex Warren's 'Ordinary' is currently at #1.

I waited months while she kept teasing us, and when she finally announced it was dropping on her website, I knew I had to have it. In March 2024, I placed my first Rhode order. I mean, I had to have the Lipcase, I needed it. I also grabbed the lip tints because I'd never bought from Rhode before.

I was always on the lookout for new stuff. At first, I only bought makeup because I was scared it might irritate my skin. I used to stick to dermatological brands like Vichy and La Roche-Posay. But I was still curious about their skincare, and I thought, why not try the Rhode kit? Plus, I really wanted that bubble bag, but at the time, it wasn't available.

mov_5C739BDA1778492665BB1429EBAA0B69,"  Some of the best growth stocks are in the consumer space, and with tariffs still very much front and center, many of these stocks remain well off their highs. Nibbling on these names, say with an initial $1,000 investment, can be a good place to start. Let's look at five consumer-focused stocks to buy now while they're still on sale. These are all solid companies with a lot of potential growth still in front of them. Image source: . 1. Amazon While Amazon (AMZN 0.39%) has rallied from its lows, the stock is still off its highs and attractively valued from a historical perspective. And if there were thoughts that tariffs were slowing consumer spending, the company just announced its largest ever Prime Day sales event. Expanded to four days, the company generated $24.1 billion in sales, according to Adobe Analytics. That's more than double the sales it saw last Black Friday. While Amazon showed it still has what it takes to drive retail sales, what's most exciting about the company is what is going on behind the scenes. Years of investment in logistics, automation, robots, and artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off, and making operations even more efficient. This is leading to cost savings and strong operating leverage. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market-share leader in cloud computing, where customers are using its services to build and deploy their own AI models and tools. It's also developed its own custom chips for training and inference, which gives it both performance and cost advantages. For long-term investors, Amazon is a great stock to own. 2. Alibaba Alibaba (BABA 1.29%) is a stock that remains on sale. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 11 times and has more than 30% of its market cap in cash and investments. The stock is not just cheap, but it's executing on multiple fronts. Its cloud business has now seen AI-related revenue more than double for seven consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, Apple's decision to use Alibaba's Qwen model to power Apple Intelligence in China could be a solid growth driver. The company's e-commerce business has also seen a solid turnaround. Alibaba invested to grow Taobao and Tmall's gross merchandise value, and now it's better monetizing its platforms through new software fees and AI tools. It's also just started with new initiatives to help further drive growth, including offering one-hour delivery and embedding shoppable Taobao links in posts on the popular Chinese Rednote app. In addition, the company continues to grow and scale out its international e-commerce segment, and it expects it to turn profitable soon. Alibaba is still in the midst of its turnaround story, and at its current valuation there's a lot of upside if it continues to execute. 3. E.l.f. Beauty A sudden slowdown in growth last quarter has put e.l.f. Beauty's (ELF 2.20%) stock on the sales rack. However, its pending acquisition of Rhode looks like it could be transformative. E.l.f. has already been one of the biggest winners in the mass-market cosmetics space, and now it's adding a fast-growing premium brand to its portfolio. Rhode generated $212 million in sales over the past year with barely any paid marketing, a limited product lineup, and selling only through its website. That's impressive. Rhode was already set to enter Sephora stores, and now e.l.f. will have the opportunity to plug Rhode into its existing retail relationships, including those with Ulta Beauty and Target, while ramping up product development and marketing. Hailey Bieber remains onboard as chief creative officer, which should help maintain brand momentum as the product line expands. The strategy is smart. Premium skincare brands such as Rhode are simply going to have better margins than mass-market color cosmetics. This is a big opportunity for the company going forward and a reason to own the stock long term. 4. JAKKS Pacific Toy company JAKKS Pacific (JAKK 1.13%) has quietly become one of the best turnaround stories in consumer products. Under CFO John Kimble — formerly of Mattel and Disney — the company has streamlined operations, improved operating margins, and returned to consistent profitability. Shares are up more than 200% over the past five years, but down 30% this year on tariff worries. The result is that the stock trades at just 8.5 times 2025 analyst earnings per share estimates and 6 times the 2026 consensus. And it's not like the company is struggling. Sales jumped 26% in Q1, fueled by licensed products tied to Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Disney's Moana 2. That momentum should continue with toy and costume launches tied to Dog Man, Minecraft, and Paw Patrol....","Some of the best growth stocks are in the consumer space, and with tariffs still very much front and center, many of these stocks remain well off their highs.

Cette saison encore, l'influenceuse impose son rythme avec une couleur inattendue qu'elle affiche subtilement, par petites touches, dans ses dernières apparitions. Ongles, accessoires, détails de maquillage… Tout semble indiquer que cette nuance bien précise s'apprête à teinter l'été 2025. Une couleur qui intrigue et s'impose déjà auprès des initiées. Rien d'étonnant quand on sait que la moindre tendance validée par Hailey Bieber finit souvent par coloniser les feeds Instagram avant de s'imposer dans les rayons des grandes enseignes. Jaune butter out, lemontini in : Hailey Bieber retourne la tendance Le butter yellow avait pourtant tout pour durer : pastel, flatteur et largement adopté sur les podiums de Chanel à Miu Miu, il s'était imposé comme la couleur du moment, embrassant vestes en toile, robes minimalistes et soies délicates. La mode semblait avoir trouvé dans cette nuance beurre une nouvelle base neutre pour l'été. Mais c'était sans compter sur l'intervention d'Hailey Bieber, qui, en une simple story Instagram, a signé la fin de règne du jaune doux. ""Le butter yellow est dépassé... respectueusement"", a-t-elle tranché, balayant la tendance d'un revers de main parfaitement manucurée. Depuis, un nouveau jaune s'impose en douce : plus franc, plus vif, presque citronné, il s'écarte du pastel pour injecter une touche acidulée dans le vestiaire estival. Baptisée lemontini, cette nuance plus affirmée s'annonce comme la couleur à suivre. Une prise de position qui bouscule les moodboards des stylistes et replace Hailey Bieber en arbitre redoutée des tendances. Jaune lemontini : la couleur qui électrise l'été 2025 Il fallait s'y attendre. Le jaune citron, longtemps resté en marge des podiums, signe son grand retour sous un nom un peu plus branché : lemontini. Une nuance fraîche et lumineuse, directement inspirée des étés méditerranéens, qui n'a rien d'une nouveauté mais que la mode redécouvre grâce à un coup de pouce inattendu. Jacquemus, Genny et quelques autres avaient amorcé le mouvement, glissant ici et là des touches de jaune acide dans leurs collections. Mais c'est Hailey Bieber qui, une fois encore, a transformé la tendance discrète en phénomène global. La fondatrice de Rhode a en effet joué la carte du jaune flashy pour rhabiller son célèbre baume à lèvres, lancé en édition spéciale sous le nom ""Lemontini"". Résultat : un simple tube citronné est devenu le nouvel accessoire fétiche des it-girls, qui s'affichent désormais toutes baume à la main, de Romee Strijd à Alexandra Saint Mleux. Derrière le succès de cette nuance ? Une stratégie marketing aussi millimétrée qu'efficace, qui a propulsé le jaune lemontini au rang de couleur de l'été, reléguant sans ménagement le butter yellow au rayon des tendances déjà vues. Le jaune lemontini passe du dressing à la trousse beauté Mais la mode ne s'arrête pas là. Le lemontini s'invite désormais dans les routines beauté. Hailey Bieber elle-même l'a adopté jusqu'au bout des ongles, optant pour une ""dot manicure"" minimaliste où le jaune vif sert de toile de fond. Sur les paupières, les make-up artists s'amusent à revisiter les aplats 80's façon citron pressé, tandis que les lèvres prennent une teinte légèrement dorée ou acidulée selon les marques. Le jaune lemontini ne se porte plus seulement sur les vêtements, il devient un véritable statement beauty. Pas étonnant, donc, que la sphère mode s'empresse de suivre. Avec son allure solaire mais plus tranchée que le pastel, le jaune lemontini promet d'apporter une dose d'énergie aux looks estivaux, tout en s'imposant comme un choix moins attendu que les habituels pastels de saison. Plus vif, plus moderne, ce jaune citron s'impose sur les robes en lin, les accessoires, et jusqu'aux détails de maquillage, devenant la touche acidulée indispensable de l'été 2025. Et, une fois de plus, c'est Hailey Bieber qui, en associant instinct mode et marketing redoutable, signe le coup d'envoi.","SPR_COMBO[fr]Lorsque Hailey Bieber mise sur une teinte, le monde de la mode suit.

mov_C51F7BD90CFFA3B41A9B36434CA10BCB,"  ""I just wanna be a hot dad"" Last month, Rhode's new ""cover girl"" elicited a gasp in the Marie Claire office. Forget the women of the moment, Hailey Bieber's beauty brand tapped this year's hottest straight, male actor: Harris Dickinson, of Babygirl fame, to promote her new Glazing Mist. ""WHY WOULD A MAN BE THERE! [sic]"", wrote one Reddit user in response to the campaign on the forum ""LAinfluencersnark"", while another added, ""What does this have to do with skincare or make-up?"" Initially, yes, it raised an eyebrow coming from Rhode's strain of “clean girl” beauty, which is famed for birthing frivolous foodstuff-related trends, like 'glazed doughnut nails', 'latte make-up' and 'strawberry girl blush'. But really, tapping Hollywood in this way makes perfect sense for a brand that has always been ahead of the curve, as their recent $1 billion acquisition from e.l.f. Beauty proves. So, I wondered, was Rhode onto something more? Does Dickinson's appointment signal his demographic's growing interest in the industry? Mentally scanning my friendship group, I can see a real shift. Dipping a toe in beauty was once by way of brands like Bulldog, who strived to ""toughen"" up moisturiser so men and boys would actually use it—now, it's a rapidly growing market. Data from a recent YouGov BrandIndex shows that in the past four years, the skincare and cosmetics sector in Britain has grown exponentially amongst young men, aged 18-34, with 65 per cent of this cohort saying that looking physically attractive is important to them. You may like Indeed, one scan of the popular social satire Instagram accounts Socks House Meeting and Real Housewives of Clapton shows that the elevated man of today prizes his Malin+Goetz Peppermint Shampoo, Aesop Parsley Seed Cleanser and Haeckles Eco Marine Cream just as much as his Salomon trainers and the carabiner he hangs off his denim jorts. And even if the majority of men are not engaging in Patrick Bateman-level multi-step routines, they're making considered purchases, based on real research. When I ask London-based filmmaker Philip, 35, if he has had a growing interest in beauty, he replies, “Massively so. If anything, I have a suspicion of traditional men's grooming brands, unless it's high-end like Kiehl's—I rely more on what my girlfriend uses and recommends. It's not so much my age, it's growing awareness. I wish I had started putting effort in far earlier. I just want to age gracefully, and the big change has been understanding SPF. I don't want to damage my skin.” A friend who works in music PR, Henry, 29, tells me that his current skincare routine came from social media and getting closer to 30. “The algorithm is pushing a gym bro aesthetic that is relentless. My discover page is filled with hyper-masculine features and low body fat percentage, and I feel like I barely even interact.” He now buys curl creme and always keeps a “healthy stock” of The INKEY List moisturiser, caffeine eye cream, retinol and a tea tree face wash. “I have started [buying more beauty products in the past two years], mostly through word of mouth recommendations from female and male friends. Now that I'm almost pushing 30, I feel more of a need to take care of myself and my looks than ever, bizarrely. I think I just wanna be a hot dad.” For Philip and Henry, this shift has translated into regularly purchasing a few targeted skincare solutions to optimise or slow down age-related concerns, but other men are taking a different approach. Dr Tony Kaliya, the award-winning founder and medical director of the NEU Clinic (who is the expert behind my own Polynucleotide treatments), says there's been a definite uptick in straight men seeking cosmetic procedures, and that it increases year on year.

Most are professionals aged between 30 and 55, although I've seen a rise in younger men coming in for preventative treatments. Once male patients start cosmetic treatments, almost all of them continue having more once they see the results.” Fellow aesthetics doctor and NHS GP, Dr Ahmed El Muntasar, agrees, saying that there's been a four hundred per cent increase in (mostly) straight men coming into his clinic for treatments. “Several factors contribute to this shift,” Dr Kaliya tells me. “Social media has played a huge role in normalising aesthetic treatments for men, and especially masculinising treatments such as chin and jawline filler. Increased visibility of male celebrities and influencers undergoing treatments has also helped break the stigma. And interestingly, the rise of high-definition Zoom calls during the pandemic made men more aware of their facial appearance, particularly lines and wrinkles, increasing the number seeking anti-wrinkle treatments such as Botox. There's also a growing cultural emphasis on optimisation—looking good is increasingly seen as part of performing well both professionally and socially.” And while the aesthetics doctor concedes that men have not faced the same scrutiny as women regarding appearance, the gap is closing, especially in competitive industries or highly visible roles. ""Men are expected to look youthful, energetic and well-groomed, and the ideal aesthetic has shifted too: strong jawlines, clear skin and well-balanced features are increasingly desirable. Most male clients aren't looking to look 'done' — they want to look like a more refreshed, well-rested version of themselves. Many are aiming to stay competitive in the workplace or dating scene without it being obvious."" As such, the most popular treatments amongst men, Dr El Muntasar explains, are collagen-stimulating treatments like Polynucleotides and JULAINE, dermal fillers for the under eyes, and Botox for fine lines and wrinkles. But ultimately, just as the beauty standard for women has grown exponentially since the advent of social media, it's having an effect on men too. Antonio, a photographer in his 30s, started getting Botox a few years ago, on top of overhauling his skincare routine to include SPF moisturiser, body oil and eye retinol. “I want to look a certain way to please myself in front of the mirror,"" he tells me.
