mov_92D97BDEF75A734F751C7D09AAC43394,"  A man who brutally murdered his girlfriend before police made the grim discovery of her decapitated body in their flat was given a life sentence Ewan Methven killed Phoenix Spencer-Horn at their home in , Lanarkshire last November. The 27-year-old postman later dialled 999 himself insisting he had a drug-induced blackout and could not remember what he had done. But it emerged after stabbing the 21-year-old to death, he mutilated her body, pretended to her mother she was still alive while also trawling the internet for porn for hours. Methven admitted to the gruesome murder as he appeared in the dock at the High Court in Glasgow. Judge Lord Matthews ordered Methven to spend at least 23 years behind bars before he can be considered for parole. The judge said: “You pleaded guilty to a dreadful crime, namely the murder of Phoenix Spencer-Horn who was a much loved and sorely missed daughter, sister, niece cousin and friend. “At age 21 and 134 days she was standing at the threshold of what should have been a long fulfilling life. Read More “You were a trusted member of her family and you betrayed that trust and robbed her of a life in the cruelest way. “Not content with what you did to her, you robbed her of all dignity in death by decapitating her and tried to dismember her in an attempt to defeat the ends of justice. “The way you treated her after her death meant that her family didn't have the comfort of saying goodbye to her. “No punishment I can inflect or what I can say or do can be enough and the only sentence that I can impose is life. “I saw a letter written by you which answers none of the questions. “You blame substances, but that is not an excuse.” Members of Phoenix's grieving relatives were at the sentencing. The couple had started dating two years before the killing. They had recently moved into the top floor one-bedroom flat in East Kilbride. Methven was employed by the Royal Mail while Phoenix - known as 'Phe' - held part times jobs at both the Strathaven Hotel and a local coffee shop. Phoenix had been working on November 16 - she was described as in ""good spirits"". Methven had texted her during her shift complaining of feeling ""lonely"" due to her hours. Phoenix apologised to her boyfriend. Methven ordered a takeaway that night and the couple ate when Phoenix got back. The young woman had contacted her mum at 9.37pm stating she was at home having dinner. The court heard this was the last communication she had with her daughter. It was around midnight that a downstairs neighbour heard ""loud noise and hurried footsteps"". Prosecutor Chris McKenna said: ""This coincided with increased activity recorded in an app measuring steps at 12.13am which was discovered upon later interrogation of Methven's phone. ""At that time, around or shortly after midnight on November 16 through to November 17, Methven attacked Phoenix by compressing her neck and repeatedly stabbing her to the head and body."" The court then heard of Methven's sick behaviour as his girlfriend lay dead including hacking at her with knives. He repeatedly arranged to buy drugs via contact on his phone. Phoenix's mum Alison Spencer had also tried contacting her daughter on the morning of November 17. Methven instead got in touch initially claiming ""Phe is not up yet"" and that he would get her to message when she was. The sick killer then later pretended to be his girlfriend and sent a text to Alison. It stated: ""Hey sorry I've just woken up xxx"". Another claimed Phoenix was apparently ""all good"". The court heard, minutes after this, Methven logged on to the adult websites. Mr McKenna: ""Throughout the day on November 17, analysis of his phone and search history revealed that, for prolonged period over several hours, he accessed pornography from 8.12am through to 6.39pm. ""He was noted to have accessed a pornographic video site 170 times."" Methven was also captured on CCTV driving Phoenix's red Vauxhall Corsa. Concerns were raised when Phoenix did not turn up for work on November 18. Methen then went on to dial 999 that afternoon stating he had had ""a drug induced psychotic break"" and that he had ""killed"" his girlfriend. He told the operator: ""The past day I have been trying to kind of muster up the courage to phone."" Methven added Phoenix remained in the hall with a knife beside her. He said he had been taking steroids and cocaine, which he believed had been spiked. Methven: ""I totally blacked out through the full thing."" He mentioned having ""stabbed"" and ""choked"" Phoenix adding: ""It was f***ing horrible."" Asked by an officer who came on the line if Phoenix could still be alive, Methven replied: ""I know she is dead, mate - she is dead."" Police soon arrived and made the grim discovery of Phoenix's remains. Mr McKenna: ""Phoenix's naked and mutilated body with her head decapitated was discovered by police covered up within the hall of their home.

n32axce,"  Ok so I read your whole post now. You are suffering so I want to recommend some stuff that might help until you can see a LLMD. My LLMD has a long wait, but she has a waiting list and you can probably see the physicians assistant through telehealth first. I don't want you to start treating the Lyme and make yourself sicker, but there's an herb called Japanese Knotweed that might help. I took it for treatment. I bought all my herbs through www.woodlandessence.com I took a bunch of other herbs, but you don't want to overload your system. Herbs are cheap and you can literally start with 1 drop and see how your body does, so you won't get as sick as antibiotics. I did not take any antibiotics because I think I've had Lyme since 1980, and I healed. So know that healing is possible. Some other stuff that might help, note that I am not a doctor and please do your own research: Vit C - I take 1000mg Nutramedix brand, but you can start with 500mg. The Solgar EsterC brand is good. You can increase to 2000mg slowly over a few weeks (to bowel tolerance, because it can cause diarrhea) Vit D3 with K2 - I take 5000iu of the Nutramedix brand. You should have your levels tested,  but most people are deficient. For headaches and neurological inflammation: NeuroFlam by Apex Energetics - this is a supplement of herbs that works amazingly well. You may experience a detox reaction at first from it. I had to start with 1 pill and couldn't take it every day, and then for 2 weeks it felt like a cloud of cigarettes was around my head (I smoked 20 years ago) because my brain was detoxing. SPM Active or SPM Supreme - very potent fish oil that is great for inflammation. This will probably also help your knee. I buy this on www.Fullscript.com one of the Lyme Facebook groups has a 25% discount, I can't remember which one. I think it's on Amazon too, but you'll pay full price. Magnesium L-threonate - this will help with headaches. I take Metagenics, which is crazy expensive, but seemed to work better than other brands. Fullscript or Amazon should have it. The Lyme bacteria eats all of our magnesium, collagen, iron, and other essential minerals. Probiotics - these are essential even if you're not on antibiotics. I take the Orthobiotic brand and get it through Fullscript, but you need a doctor for these. Certain supplements on Fullscript are only available through a doctor. You can probably find a similar probiotic elsewhere. QUIT WHEAT and dairy. They are very inflammatory. Also, give up alcohol, processed food, and sugar. Yes I know, that's impossible. Try to eat gluten free and as clean as possible, it will help. The idea is to lower inflammation. Great Lakes collagen powder - very cheap for a month's supply. I still take this daily. This might help your knee pain right away. Burbur Pinella - this is a mix of herbs that Nutramedix sells, it's also on Amazon. Start with 1 drop because it causes a detox reaction. But it can be a huge help for clearing the lymphatic system and the brain. If taking this then take activated charcoal 30min later and it will help. Detox: This is very important. The easiest is to take activated charcoal 2 hours away from meals and other pills. Even if you're not killing the Lyme with antibiotics your immune system is working hard so this will help. Amazon sells activated charcoal and it's the cheapest thing you can buy....","Ok so I read your whole post now.

mov_E338315E766D789294DFBA7977CB5B37,"  A postman who decapitated his girlfriend after complaining she was working too much has been jailed for life. Ewan Methven, 27, admitted murdering Phoenix Spencer-Horn at their home on Nov 16 last year, after the couple ordered a takeaway to their flat in Glen Lee, East Kilbride. Prosecutors told the High Court in Glasgow that Methven choked her before severing her head and trying to remove her limbs and torso from her body. Earlier that day, Methven had complained to his girlfriend that her waitress shifts made him “lonely”. After murdering and decapitating his 21-year-old girlfriend, he texted her mother pretending to be her and he trawled the internet for pornography for hours. Methven later dialled 999, insisting he had a drug-induced blackout and could not remember what he had done. But Judge Lord Matthews at the High Court in Glasgow ordered Methven to spend at least 23 years behind bars before he can be considered for parole. He told Methven: “You pleaded guilty to a dreadful crime, namely the murder of Phoenix Spencer-Horn, who was a much-loved and sorely missed daughter, sister, niece, cousin and friend. “At age 21 and 134 days, she was standing at the threshold of what should have been a long, fulfilling life. You were a trusted member of her family, and you betrayed that trust and robbed her of a life in the cruellest way. “Not content with what you did to her, you robbed her of all dignity in death by decapitating her and tried to dismember her in an attempt to defeat the ends of justice. “The way you treated her after her death meant that her family didn't have the comfort of saying goodbye to her. No punishment I can inflict or what I can say or do can be enough and the only sentence that I can impose is life. “I saw a letter written by you which answers none of the questions. You blame substances, but that is not an excuse.” The couple met at a family party and had been dating for two years before the killing. They had recently moved into the top floor, one-bedroom flat. 'Good spirits' Methven was employed by the Royal Mail while Ms Spencer-Horn, who was known as Phe, held part-time jobs at the Strathaven Hotel and a local coffee shop.

At about midnight, a downstairs neighbour heard a “loud noise and hurried footsteps”. This coincided with increased activity recorded on a phone app measuring Methven's steps. He had attacked Ms Spencer-Horn with three knives, stabbing her 20 times. The fatal stab wound was to the chest. There were others in that area, as well as to the face and buttocks. The court heard that he had attempted to “sever her torso, right wrist and ankle from her body”. Methven tried to cover up the killing for two days and spent the weekend driving Ms Spencer-Horn's red Vauxhall Corsa. Prosecutors said he scrolled through her phone and searched 170 times for internet pornography and made several attempts to buy cocaine. He also repeatedly pretended in texts to his victim's mother, Alison Spencer, that her daughter was “alive and well”. Ms Spencer had tried to contact her daughter on the morning of Nov 17, and Methven replied, saying “Phe is not up yet” and that he would get her to message when she was. He later pretended to be his girlfriend and sent a text to her mother, saying: “Hey, sorry I've just woken up xxx.” Another claimed Ms Spencer-Horn was apparently “all good”. The court heard that minutes after this, Methven logged on to adult websites and accessed pornography over a period of more than 10 hours. 'Psychotic break' Concerns were raised when Ms Spencer-Horn did not turn up for work on Nov 18. Methen dialled 999 that afternoon, stating he had had “a drug-induced psychotic break” and that he had “killed” his girlfriend. He said he had “blacked out through the full thing”. He told the operator: “The past day I have been trying to kind of muster up the courage to phone.” Methven said his girlfriend's body was in the hall with a knife beside her. He said he had been taking steroids and cocaine, which he believed had been spiked. Police found her “mutilated body” with two blood-stained knives next to her. A third blood-stained knife was found discarded in the bedroom. Methven was described as “calm”, telling the officers: “I could not stay here with her like that. I tried to dismember her. I moved her from the bath and put her there.”...","A postman who decapitated his girlfriend after complaining she was working too much has been jailed for life.

1lzmyto,"  I really need to get this off my chest. My lateness at my work finally caught up with me and I got fired by a person who directly told me he's not working with his heart. He's working by the books. He said I'm a really nice person and everyone has a story. My story is complicated , I'm essentially couch surfing , no money , pathetic, easily depressed , distracted , low self esteem , etc , I can't seem to get a hold on my life essentially or emotionally where at this point I'm so emotionally broken in life that I have a habit of disassociating all the time as if I'm not even in my body. I chose to go to the gym longer than I should've because that is where I distress and so I was late to work and I didn't clock in and then of course the manager was notified, and then it went to the upper management. I feel like I'm the water that swirls around when you're done taking a bath and the tub is almost empty. I feel like that I feel like that spiral and I don't know how to get out of it. I just distract myself from my problems in life until they catch up with me I guess . The thing is I really like this job, but I allowed myself to not be disciplined and take it seriously because that's also my problem. I don't take anything in life seriously. I don't know how to start over. I don't know how to become a disciplined individual who works a 9 to 5 and quite frankly I think inside I don't want to be that it's it's complicated. It's like no job that I get hired for is entertaining enough for me to want to stay and be responsible. Like I said I'm being fully transparent. I really did need to get this off my chest because I feel like a failure and I have so much potential. And what happens is in the beginning of a job that I work I do a great job. I love it. It's fun but then once I get used to everything I start being lazy or taking it for granted. I don't appreciate customers who take my service for granted or are rude to me or other customers like it extremely bothers me I of course always smile and I'm happy and kind but perhaps that is a big part of why I don't keep jobs well . When I was a waitress, I had to quit that job because I would go above and beyond to give my customers great service and when they would only tip me five dollars, it would literally make me question my worth. I completely understand that that's how society normally is however for me personally, I couldn't continue working a job, knowing that every single table was gonna tip me only five to $10. The ones that tipped the most, of course made up for my loss during the day, but my point of this since I'm ranting at this point is how do I keep a job that gives me money that keeps me entertained and makes me want to be disciplined and not be a loser like how I am? Like most people my age have careers probably have never been homeless have an apartment have a car and I have none of those things because of my life's choices. Mind you I literally did have those things I had stability and now I have no stability and it's been almost a year . I need stability. I don't wanna be nomadic. I don't want to appear to have my life together . I absolutely need and want my life to be together. Like everyone else . Perhaps this is my real life reality check but I've gone through so much already, but it just feels like it's a part of whatever plan life has for me that seems to be no good. Idk Thanks for listening .","I really need to get this off my chest. My lateness at my work finally caught up with me and I got fired by a person who directly told me he's not working with his heart.

I completely understand that that's how society normally is however for me personally, I couldn't continue working a job, knowing that every single table was gonna tip me only five to $10. The ones that tipped the most, of course made up for my loss during the day, but my point of this since I'm ranting at this point is how do I keep a job that gives me money that keeps me entertained and makes me want to be disciplined and not be a loser like how I am? Like most people my age have careers probably have never been homeless have an apartment have a car and I have none of those things because of my life's choices. Mind you I literally did have those things I had stability and now I have no stability and it's been almost a year . I need stability. I don't wanna be nomadic. I don't want to appear to have my life together . I absolutely need and want my life to be together. Like everyone else . Perhaps this is my real life reality check but I've gone through so much already, but it just feels like it's a part of whatever plan life has for me that seems to be no good.

1lzt1m7,"  Let's be honest. You can meditate, script, chant, journal, even cry under the full moon. But if you're still holding on too tightly, second-guessing everything, or obsessing over what's not happening, then you're not in your power. Surrender isn't soft. It's strong. It's the moment you say, “I've done what I can. Now I trust what comes next.” Let's walk through what surrender really looks like and how to start living it. You're Holding On Too Tight: You've set your intention. You've done the work. Now you're trying to force it into form. Surrender means stepping back and letting the outcome breathe. If it's meant for you, it'll show up. If it's not, something better will. Holding on tighter doesn't speed things up. It blocks the flow. Control Is Not Confidence: Trying to control every detail is a fear response. It's not you being responsible. It's you being scared it won't work unless you make it happen. Let go. Seriously. You can still care deeply without clinging to the outcome. Let the Past Stay There: You already lived through it. Stop carrying it like a trophy of pain. Whether it's an ex, a mistake, or a version of you that no longer fits, it's time to cut the cord. Not because it didn't matter, but because it's over. Say it: “Thanks for the lesson. I'm not bringing this into my next chapter.” Stop Waiting for Closure: You might never get the apology, the explanation, or the full circle moment. Closure isn't something they give you. It's something you give yourself. Release it anyway. Self-Doubt Isn't the Truth: That voice in your head saying you're not ready or not good enough? It's not your intuition. It's your fear in disguise. You don't need to be fearless. You need to stop giving doubt the final say. Fear Talks Loud, But You Don't Have to Listen: Fear loves to shout. It wants to protect you from disappointment. But if you always listen to fear, you'll live on repeat. Hear it. Thank it. Move anyway....","Let's be honest.

But how do you truly make those tips part of your nightly routine? It's time to abandon the passive reading and actively implement what you've learned. Think of it like this: sleep hygiene isn't just information, it's a practice. - Launch with small, manageable changes to your routine. Maybe that means turning off your phone an hour before bed or dimming the lights in your home. - Subtly build up to bigger changes like establishing a regular bedtime and wake-up time, even on weekends. - Focus on creating a calming pre-sleep routine that signals your body it's time to relax. A warm bath, some light stretching, or reading a book can all help. Keep in mind that consistency is key when it comes to sleep hygiene. It takes time to build new habits, so be patient with yourself and acknowledge your progress along the way.

Originally published on September 4, 2024, this story is being recirculated on the occasion of Chloë Sevigny's Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie (for Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story). As she enters the deserted tea shop in Soho, Chloë Sevigny is carrying a large cardboard box containing vintage Margiela boots from the RealReal, a giant pink neoprene tote, and a boxy black Loewe purse. Her long beachy-yellow hair is down under a CANNES '69 ball cap, and her crisp sky-blue oxford is buttoned all the way up over black hot pants so short you can't see them under the shirt. She's wearing really, truly, absolutely no makeup. She'd be camera-ready except her eyes — red-rimmed with incipient tears — are a dead giveaway that something isn't right. “I dropped the kid at camp, crying, screaming he didn't want to go in,” she says as she settles onto the stool next to mine at the counter. “So it was very challenging, part of why I'm crying.” Then she had walked back the ten or so blocks to her under-renovation apartment (she's combining it with the unit next door) to drop off some checks for the contractors and pick up the package she's now carrying, then back to this café, which is near where she started. Her husband, the gallerist Siniša Mackovic, is currently out of town at an art fair, so she's been solo parenting. She orders a matcha with extra hot water, and when it comes, she seems immediately restored by the tea the way characters in old British novels are. She cradles the cup in her palms and sits with her endless legs primly crossed. “Okay,” she says. “So what are the questions?” The morning up till now disappears. Chloë Sevigny has arrived at work. In This Issue Chloë Sevigny See All For more than 30 years, Sevigny has represented the height of downtown cool, but since Vanja was born in 2020, she's also become a working mom who gets emotional when her toddler clings to her leg at drop-off. It's somewhat surreal to see her struggle with the same things that I and every mom I know have been working through. But as she tells me about life with Vanja and the next stage she's envisioning for her career, she sounds just like herself. Her fall schedule is packed. “I have a film, Bonjour Tristesse, going to Toronto, so I go to the Toronto Film Festival for a couple of days, and then Monsters” — the new installment of the Ryan Murphy series, in which she plays Kitty Menendez — “comes out, so we do some promotion for that. There's a premiere in L.A. and then press in New York and then Charli XCX is playing at Madison Square Garden. And then I think I have a fashion requirement — going to a show in Paris.” After that, in November, she'll turn 50. “And hopefully nothing big comes along and I can start really focusing on one of the features” — three films she wants to direct — “really full-tilt boogie.” Her hope is that by the time her birthday rolls around, a new era in her career will open up, one in which she'll get to spend more time behind the camera than in front of it. She has directed short films but never a full-length feature. She's been conceptualizing these three films since the pre-pandemic, pre-baby era of her life. It'll be a huge change to work on a project where she's the boss. SAINT LAURENT BY ANTHONY VACCARELLO Double-Breasted Blazer, Shirt, Wide Tie, Wide-Leg Trouser, and Jean Derby, at ysl.com.

She tells me the film is set at Yale and centers on a student's accusations of inappropriate behavior by a professor. Sevigny plays a psychologist. She arranged for her babysitter, who's currently in London stocking a hotel room with Vanja's favorite snacks from Whole Foods, to have a small role in the movie, so she'll have her child with her on set for some scenes. The daily drop-offs during this clingy phase have been so wrenching that sometimes Sevigny just gives up and lets Vanja tag along to wherever she's going, which this week included a photo shoot for this magazine. “He's a good set baby,” she says. “He is very quiet — he realizes that if he wants to make noise, he has to go outside.” And for Sevigny, emotionally, it's easier just to bring him. “I almost like it better having him there and then I feel less guilty about being at work.” Sevigny describes her parenting style as “still skin-to-skin.”...","BURBERRY Trousers, at us.burberry.com.

Just so you know, some of the links in this post are affiliate links. This means that if you buy something through them, I might earn a little bit of money, at no extra cost to you. There's absolutely no pressure to buy anything, but if you do, it genuinely helps support the time and love I put into writing these posts. So here's the thing—I'm not exactly what you'd call a “wellness girly.” I don't wake up at 5am to do hot yoga while journaling my manifestations. In fact, if I manage to brush my hair and drink a glass of water before 10am, I consider that a productive morning. But over the last year, I started slipping little wellness habits into my day. And by little, I mean so tiny, lazy-me approved, and sometimes so ridiculously simple, it almost feels like cheating. And the best part? Most of these came from random Amazon finds that showed up on my doorstep in 2 days and somehow changed my life (or at least my gut). Let me walk you through what's actually stuck—and no, there's no green juice recipe or expensive retreat involved. 1. The Water Bottle That Judges You Less Let's start with hydration, because apparently it solves everything from bloating to bad moods. But here's the truth: I'm forgetful. I need water to follow me around like an emotionally available boyfriend. Enter the HydroMate 32 oz Motivational Water Bottle  Buy on Amazon This thing literally has time markers and little notes like “You've got it!” and “Keep drinking!” —which is oddly motivating, even when you're tired of everyone's pep. I keep it next to me all day like an emotional support water jug. And the result? Fewer headaches, more energy, and significantly less dry mouth during Zoom calls. 2. Walks, But For People Who Hate Walking Let me confess something. I used to think walking for “mental health” was just Instagram therapy speak. Then I got this under-desk walking pad and started using it during boring meetings. WalkingPad Foldable Treadmill It's quiet, folds up, and doesn't take up more space than a yoga mat. I walk while I reply to emails or while bingeing Love Is Blind. I'm not breaking a sweat, but I'm moving—and honestly, my mood is better and my legs aren't numb after sitting for 6 hours straight. 3. The Lazy Girl's Stretching Ritual I used to think I needed a yoga class to stretch. Spoiler: I didn't. I just needed this foam roller set that feels like a massage, minus the awkward small talk with a stranger rubbing my calves. TriggerPoint Foam Roller Set I keep it under the couch and use it during TV time. No yoga mat. No rules. Just a few lazy rolls and somehow my back stops feeling like it's made of Legos. If you work from home and your spine is fighting for its life—this one's for you. 4. Supplements I Don't Forget to Take I used to buy vitamins with the best intentions. And then they'd sit in a drawer until they expired. But these vitamin organizers changed everything. AUVON Weekly Pill Organizer I fill it up on Sundays while watching true crime documentaries. Then I just toss the day's box in my bag, and boom—one less thing to remember. I actually take my magnesium now, which has helped my sleep and anxiety way more than I expected. 5. Morning Light Without Leaving Your House Waking up in the dark during winter basically turns me into a human-sized blanket burrito. But this sunrise alarm clock makes mornings 10x less painful.

An EOS Cashmere Body Oil so silky and glow-inducing, your skin will literally look like it hopped off at hydration station. This lightweight formula melts in like butter (minus the grease), locks in moisture for 24 hours, and leaves behind a subtle yet delectable scent of ""Vanilla Cashmere."" Oh — and plot twist? That's the same scent as the internet-famous EOS lotion everyone's obsessed with. Promising review: ""I love the scent of this body oil, it wasn't too oily, it made my skin softer, it wasn't greasy at all and it's an excellent value for the money. I will definitely be buying more in the near future."" —Delina Flowers Price: $12.99 2. A dainty pair of bow earrings that'll have people asking ""OMG, where'd you get those?"" every time you wear them. Available in gold and silver, these cuties are the perfect mix of trendy and timeless — and they're under $15... a steal, IMO. Promising review: ""Obsessed!! These earrings are so stinkin' cute! They are the perfect size — not too big, but not too small, either. For my ears they didn't feel heavy to wear all day. I just love them!!"" —Danielle Sharp Furlow Price: $12.99 (available in three styles) 3. A pair of retro-inspired oval sunglasses if you want to wear a signature Miu Miu sunglass style without paying designer prices. These petite, trendy frames are giving ""celebrity in hiding"" energy, complete with UV protection and a lightweight feel. You may catch yourself wearing these at any chance you get when it's sunny out (you've been warned). Promising review: ""I bought these sunglasses because they're very trendy right now, but I didn't want to dish out an exorbitant amount of money because the frame isn't my usual. They block out the sun better than my designer sunglasses. I'm glad I bought them because they are extremely sturdy, just as pictured, and (actually?) they frame my face very nicely!"" —Addie Price: $15.99+ for two pairs (available in 29 colors and various packs) 4. A bladeless neck fan for when it's so hot you're considering becoming nocturnal. This bladeless, hands-free fan wraps around your neck and sends out a cool breeze in all directions — without messing up your hair or sounding like a jet engine. It's rechargeable, lightweight, and has different speed settings so you can control your personal chill zone as you're commuting, walking the dog, or just trying to survive summer. Promising review: ""This arrived quickly, love the color, had NO chemical or new plastic fumes, already had a bit of a charge to test it before charging it fully. I must say both [my husband and I] are impressed with the amount of power it has on all [three] settings. The sound isn't too loud for my senses, and I actually enjoy the fan sound, as it's quite soothing in a crowded space. Looking forward to having some much needed breeze relief throughout the summer!"" —Linda Price: $23.98+ (available in eight colors) 5. A hydrating E.l.f. lip balm which feels just as buttery soft as Laneige *and* has the same glossy finish to boot. It *also* comes in yummy flavors like Vanilla Frosting, Strawberry, and Honeydew and leaves a sheer tint of color — it's the perfect lil' treat for your lips! BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord had this to say: ""I love love love this lip balm. I compare it to the $24 version from Summer Fridays, which I've been splurging on — I love that brand because it lasts so long and is so high quality, but this $4 E.l.f. version feels comparable and, more excitingly, comes in smaller versions so I can stock my totes and bathroom with them whether I'm at home or on the go. It's hydrating, lightweight, doesn't get sticky, and adds a perfect ~subtle~ gloss whether I'm using it alone or on top of a lip color. I love the vanilla flavor so much, it's got a similar vibe to the birthday cake flavor that Glossier sometimes carries."" Promising review: ""I have one in my car, one in my purse, and one at home.

Before she moved back in with us, she stayed at our house while we were on a trip. When we returned from the trip, I found things in our ensuite bathroom in the wrong place. When I went to get clean towels, there were towels in the wrong place. I knew that my stepdaughter had used our ensuite shower and our towels. I just made a mental note of items out of place, but didn't say anything. A few months later, she confessed that she had used the shower. I said that I already knew this because I found things out of place. She insisted that she put everything back in place and my husband kind of gave me a dirty look. Yes, there is a full hall bath that she normally uses. It is directly across the hall from her bedroom door. She moved back in with us sooner than expected so we still had a few things in the room that is now her bedroom. One day while she was at work,I did not have a lot to do so I went into the room and removed our remaining items. I truly felt like I was doing a kind thing for her because it would give her more space and allow her to organize her belongings better. She got upset and set a boundary that we should not go into her room without her prior permission. It's definitely fair for her to set a boundary that we should not go into her room without asking but I had a specific reason and wanted to surprise her. Nevertheless I apologized and said I would clear it next time. I was reflecting on these incidents this morning and found it ironic that it was OK for her to use our shower and our towels but not OK for me to go remove our things from her room. My husband and I are about to take a short trip. I would prefer that she not use our shower so I am considering locking the door to the primary suite. I do feel like my husband has a little bit of a problem setting boundaries with the young adults so I think he would be upset with me if I did this. I feel like what what's fair is fair. It's fair to ask us not to enter her room and I think it's fair that she should not use our shower. So would I be TA if I lock the door and don't mention it to either of them? **AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received the majority of NTAs and a few others** **Relevant / Top Comments** **Commenter 1:** Is there a reason you can't have a conversation with her and let her know you understand her request and expect the same respect?

Why did she try to put everything back in the same place as if she hadn't used the bathroom? **Commenter 2:** YES. Put a lock on your door. The only way she'll ever find out is if she tries to open it... Which in her own words, would be crossing a boundary... If you don't give her permission she has no right to be in your room.

A viral TikTok video shared in June under the username @fortheloveofkittenrescue, shows the poster, who rescues kittens with the help of nonprofit organization Miss Dixie's Kitten Rescue, gently bathing a small black kitten, combing fleas off his fur. She explains in the clip: ""You guys there is another sibling, and he is very mad. Last night the person who found Montana originally, reached back out and said 'Hey, I think there's a third kitten', and I said 'That's awesome, if you can catch him, bring him right to me,' and she caught him, and here he is!"" Unlike his sibling Montana, the second kitty was much healthier, though he still had worm belly and was ridden with fleas. ""Because he was stable, the first thing we did last night is he got a bath, and boy was he not happy about this scenario. The bath is used not only to get them clean, but also to kill any live fleas that are on them. Even after bathing his entire body and his face, they were coming out of literally nowhere,"" she said. After bath time, both kittens, Hannah and Montana, also got some food to chomp on before bed. The poster, 33-year-old Mary Morton, told Newsweek that initially an individual rang them abut two kittens who were very sick, and she suggested he bring them over, however, one of them soon died. The following day, the same person contacted her again and said there was another sibling, so she told them to bring them over too. ""He got a bath, some medical attention and joined his brother in the kitten incubator (aka the Timeout toaster as my audience so lovingly refers to it),"" she said. ""What I loved so much about these two was how different their personalities were from the start. Hannah was feral and very scared of anything and everything, whereas Montana just seemed like he knew what I did for him and was so loving, chatty and sweet from the moment he felt better."" The two kittens continued to improve until Montana was eventually adopted fairly quickly through Miss Dixie's Kitten Rescue to a loving family. ""Hannah had to hang around for a bit while he learned that the world isn't so scary, but eventually he was adopted with his buddy, Copper, in fall of 2023,"" she said. ""Their story was just one of many. Miss Dixie's does incredible work, and I am currently in veterinary school in order to help more kittens and help make veterinary care more accessible to everyone."" Around 2.9 million homeless cats entered American shelters in 2024, according to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (ASPCA), and of those only 2.2 million were adopted. Of those who didn't find a new home, 362,000 were returned to their original owners or the field, 369,000 were transferred to other organizations, and about 273,000 were euthanized. The video quickly went viral on social media and it has so far received over 571,100 views and 78,200 likes on the platform.

Before she moved back in with us, she stayed at our house while we were on a trip. When we returned from the trip, I found things in our ensuite bathroom in the wrong place. When I went to get clean towels, there were towels in the wrong place. I knew that my stepdaughter had used our ensuite shower and our towels. I just made a mental note of items out of place, but didn't say anything. A few months later, she confessed that she had used the shower. I said that I already knew this because I found things out of place. She insisted that she put everything back in place and my husband kind of gave me a dirty look. Yes, there is a full hall bath that she normally uses. It is directly across the hall from her bedroom door. She moved back in with us sooner than expected so we still had a few things in the room that is now her bedroom. One day while she was at work,I did not have a lot to do so I went into the room and removed our remaining items. I truly felt like I was doing a kind thing for her because it would give her more space and allow her to organize her belongings better. She got upset and set a boundary that we should not go into her room without her prior permission. It's definitely fair for her to set a boundary that we should not go into her room without asking but I had a specific reason and wanted to surprise her. Nevertheless I apologized and said I would clear it next time. I was reflecting on these incidents this morning and found it ironic that it was OK for her to use our shower and our towels but not OK for me to go remove our things from her room. My husband and I are about to take a short trip. I would prefer that she not use our shower so I am considering locking the door to the primary suite. I do feel like my husband has a little bit of a problem setting boundaries with the young adults so I think he would be upset with me if I did this. I feel like what what's fair is fair. It's fair to ask us not to enter her room and I think it's fair that she should not use our shower. So would I be TA if I lock the door and don't mention it to either of them? **AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP received the majority of NTAs and a few others** **Relevant / Top Comments** **Commenter 1:** Is there a reason you can't have a conversation with her and let her know you understand her request and expect the same respect?

1m1s19e,"  I decided to share my (positive) epidural story because there are so few out there. I'll preface by saying that everyone's birth plan is special and personal - you do you! But I feel like it helps to have multiple stories and perspectives floating around. I was induced just after 38 weeks. I had originally asked to not be offered an epidural. I was open to having one but had weird ideas about a natural birth being “tougher” or “more real” (truly wtf was I thinking). I asked my partner, my doula, and doctors to help me through other options (ie gas, coached breathing, a bath) and to only provide an epidural if I explicitly asked for it. I was very naive. Because of the Pitocin, my contractions were INTENSE and very, very close together from the very start. I was dilating very slowly and was already exhausted at 4cm. I quickly became desperate for the epidural I previously was sure I didn't want, ha. I cannot explain the euphoria I felt once it kicked in. I had been in so much excruciating pain, and then it was just…gone. Contrary to everything I had read and heard, it actually sped up my labour. I progressed pretty quickly, and the nurse said that my body might have just been so tense from the pain, and the epidural might have let me finally relax and allow my body to do its work. When it was time to push, I could still feel my body contract. It wasn't painful, it was just uncomfortable - like a deep pressure. I was grateful I could still feel this, because I could still listen to my body and follow its cues. My son was born after under an hour of pushing. I was relaxed and fully present and able to spend our first moments together so peacefully. It was magical. Just a positive anecdote. I am one and done, but if I were to have another, I would not hesitate for a single second to get an epidural. Happy birthing!","I decided to share my (positive) epidural story because there are so few out there. I'll preface by saying that everyone's birth plan is special and personal - you do you!

Gasping for air, crying , i'm even coming off my blood pressure medicine today is day 2 of half a dose and my blood pressure has been fine ! But my pulse has been in the 120s . There are moments where I am scared of having a heart attack . When it rains it pours and too much happened at once for my body to cope. I'm so disappointed in myself. All I just want is a hug a meaningful one ,a long one . I have a trip next week. I planned in advance and though I'm feeling how I'm feeling I'm still going to go. I'm excited ,I'm nervous about the ride as I am driving so I hope my anxiety doesn't have too much of a flareup like I know it will. I just went for a drive Something I used to do when I was anxious, trying to chase the sun . Although I didn't get to see a lot of it, I didn't make it to my spot. By the dam, I even dipped my feet in the water. I'm really trying anything but it almost seems like nothing helps anymore. . . I've even been talking to my mom in front of people (my mom has passed years ago) so I probably look like I'm a crazy person, but I'm not I'm trying to stop myself from becoming crazy",2025-07-17 01:04:17,en,REDDIT,,,,,1,False,False,"The provided comment is a deeply personal narrative about mental health, anxiety, and personal struggles.

She has made huge progress and improvement and is even using a wheelchair and building up her core strength as well as the strength in her left arm."" Ricardo shared his family's emotional journey: ""It's been a roller coaster of emotions, heartache and anxiety. But as her parents we remain forever grateful that she is still with us and for all the incredible dedication and hard work that the staff here at Alder Hey and Ormskirk Children's A&E have done, they saved our Penelope's life."" At present, Penelope continues to receive treatment in the critical care ward at Alder Hey, where she is being prepared for a skin graft procedure. Her father mentioned that should the skin grafts progress according to expectations, they hope for her release sometime around October. The family is actively raising funds for Penelope's future to guarantee she receives the ""best possible chance of living an independent life."" Ricardo explained: ""We want to give her the best quality life and opportunities to fulfil any of her dreams and hopes that she had before this occurred. ""We want her to be able to not let this deter her from being the most energetic, fun, lively girl that she always has been. She remains determined and motivated to keep building her strength. The strength and resilience she shows us every day is just incredible and we are just so proud of her."" Penelope and her family are also eager to increase awareness about the ""scary"" illness and warn others about the warning signs they should monitor. Symptoms of meningitis and sepsis include: a high temperature cold hands and feet vomiting confusion breathing quickly muscle and joint pain pale, mottled or blotchy skin (this may be harder to see on brown or black skin) spots or a rash (this may be harder to see on brown or black skin) headache a stiff neck a dislike of bright lights being very sleepy or difficult to wake fits (seizures) Babies may also: refuse feeds be irritable have a high-pitched cry have a stiff body or be floppy or unresponsive have a bulging soft spot on the top of their head For more information from the NHS click here.",2025-07-17 08:51:53,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The provided text is a detailed news article about a young girl named Penelope Vidal-Walsh and her medical struggle with meningitis.

1m2etjv,"  Hawthorne House loomed over the fog-draped street, a three-story Victorian monolith built in 1855, its steeply pitched roof crowned with iron finials that pierced the gray sky like skeletal fingers. The exterior, once painted in vibrant pastels, had faded to a ghostly lavender and sage, the paint peeling in curling strips to reveal weathered wood beneath. Bay windows, their leaded glass panes glinting with an oily sheen, protruded from the facade, reflecting the town's muted light in fractured patterns. A wraparound porch, supported by columns carved with twisting ivy, encircled the house, its floorboards groaning under Emily's cautious steps. The garden, overgrown with thorny roses and tangled ivy, seemed to clutch at the house, as if nature itself sought to reclaim it. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decay, a prelude to the unease that awaited within. Emily, a 28-year-old graduate student, stepped from the cab, her chestnut hair catching the dim light, her hazel eyes scanning the house with a mix of curiosity and apprehension. Her beauty, often a quiet burden, drew attention she preferred to avoid, and already she felt the weight of unseen eyes. A Ph.D. candidate researching 19th-century boarding houses, she had chosen Hawthorne House for its age and whispered reputation as a place of strange occurrences, inspired by her great-grandmother's tales of a similar house where shadows moved without cause. Her suitcase, heavy with books and notebooks, thumped against the porch as she approached the oak door, its floral carvings worn smooth by time. The brass lion's head knocker, tarnished but imposing, felt cold under her touch, and she hesitated before letting it fall with a hollow thud. The door creaked open, revealing Mr. Hawthorne, the manager. Tall and gaunt, with graying hair and eyes like chips of winter ice, he offered a smile that clung to his face like a mask. “Miss Emily, I presume?” His voice was smooth, almost too smooth, with an undercurrent that made her skin prickle. “Welcome to Hawthorne House.” “Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne,” Emily replied, her voice steady despite the shiver running down her spine. His gaze lingered, not predatory but searching, as if he saw something in her she did not yet know. He led her through a dimly lit hallway, where portraits of stern-faced Victorians stared from faded frames, their eyes seeming to track her every step. The air was thick with the scent of aged wood, lavender, and a faint, unplaceable decay, like breath from a forgotten tomb. A grand staircase, its banister carved with twisting vines, ascended to the upper floors, each step groaning as if protesting their passage. “Your room is on the second floor,” Mr. Hawthorne said, his polished shoes clicking on the polished wood. “One of our finest, with a view of the garden.” The room was small but high-ceilinged, its faded floral wallpaper curling at the edges. A four-poster bed, draped in worn velvet, dominated the space, flanked by a washstand with a chipped porcelain basin and pitcher. A heavy wardrobe, its mirror warped and spotted, stood against one wall, while a writing desk by a narrow window offered a view of the tangled garden below. A threadbare rug, its pattern faded to a ghostly outline, covered the creaking floorboards. But it was the corner opposite the bed that seized Emily's attention. The walls met at an angle that defied logic—neither right nor acute, but something in between, shifting subtly when she blinked. The wallpaper's floral pattern twisted near the corner, petals morphing into grotesque faces, mouths open in silent screams. A cold draft seeped from the space, carrying a faint hum that vibrated in her bones. Emily blinked, attributing the illusion to the dim light of the oil lamp, but the sense of wrongness lingered, a knot of dread in her chest. “It's charming,” she said, her voice wavering. Mr. Hawthorne's smile tightened, his eyes glinting with something unreadable. “Dinner is at seven. Do make yourself at home.” As he left, the door clicked shut with a finality that echoed in her chest, and she felt the weight of unseen eyes settle upon her. Emily unpacked her books—tomes on Victorian social history, architectural journals, and her great-grandmother's worn diary—arranging them on the desk. The room's furnishings, relics of the 19th century, included a chamber pot tucked discreetly under the bed and a tin bathtub in the corner, a reminder of the era's lack of modern plumbing. The wardrobe's mirror reflected her face with a slight distortion, her hazel eyes appearing too large, too vulnerable. She tried to focus on her research, but the feeling of being watched was inescapable, as if the portraits in the hallway had followed her into the room. Later, needing to shake off the travel dust and the pervasive chill of the house, Emily decided to brave the tin bathtub. She filled it with water, the metallic clang echoing in the quiet room, and added a few drops of lavender oil she'd brought, hoping to counteract the scent of decay. The steam rose, momentarily softening the harsh edges of the room, clinging to her skin like a second atmosphere. Emily shed her clothes, the cool air raising goosebumps on her arms, revealing the graceful curve of her back and the delicate line of her shoulders. Her long chestnut hair, usually tied back, now cascaded down her spine, damp from the humidity, a dark silk against her pale skin. As she stepped into the warm water, a shiver traced her spine that had nothing to do with the temperature, a curious tingling that was both unsettling and strangely alluring. The small room felt vast, and the shadows seemed to deepen, particularly around the unsettling corner, which seemed to hum with a low, almost imperceptible vibration. She reached for the bar of soap, her fingers tracing the smooth, wet contours of her body, keenly aware of the silence, broken only by the lapping of water and the distant groaning of the old house. Her hazel eyes, usually so focused, darted to the warped mirror on the wardrobe, then to the closed door, then back to the corner, a blush rising on her cheeks despite herself....","Hawthorne House loomed over the fog-draped street, a three-story Victorian monolith built in 1855, its steeply pitched roof crowned with iron finials that pierced the gray sky like skeletal fingers. The exterior, once painted in vibrant pastels, had faded to a ghostly lavender and sage, the paint peeling in curling strips to reveal weathered wood beneath. Bay windows, their leaded glass panes glinting with an oily sheen, protruded from the facade, reflecting the town's muted light in fractured patterns. A wraparound porch, supported by columns carved with twisting ivy, encircled the house, its floorboards groaning under Emily's cautious steps. The garden, overgrown with thorny roses and tangled ivy, seemed to clutch at the house, as if nature itself sought to reclaim it. The air was heavy with the scent of damp earth and decay, a prelude to the unease that awaited within. Emily, a 28-year-old graduate student, stepped from the cab, her chestnut hair catching the dim light, her hazel eyes scanning the house with a mix of curiosity and apprehension. Her beauty, often a quiet burden, drew attention she preferred to avoid, and already she felt the weight of unseen eyes. A Ph.D. candidate researching 19th-century boarding houses, she had chosen Hawthorne House for its age and whispered reputation as a place of strange occurrences, inspired by her great-grandmother's tales of a similar house where shadows moved without cause. Her suitcase, heavy with books and notebooks, thumped against the porch as she approached the oak door, its floral carvings worn smooth by time. The brass lion's head knocker, tarnished but imposing, felt cold under her touch, and she hesitated before letting it fall with a hollow thud. The door creaked open, revealing Mr. Hawthorne, the manager. Tall and gaunt, with graying hair and eyes like chips of winter ice, he offered a smile that clung to his face like a mask. “Miss Emily, I presume?” His voice was smooth, almost too smooth, with an undercurrent that made her skin prickle. “Welcome to Hawthorne House.” “Thank you, Mr. Hawthorne,” Emily replied, her voice steady despite the shiver running down her spine. His gaze lingered, not predatory but searching, as if he saw something in her she did not yet know. He led her through a dimly lit hallway, where portraits of stern-faced Victorians stared from faded frames, their eyes seeming to track her every step. The air was thick with the scent of aged wood, lavender, and a faint, unplaceable decay, like breath from a forgotten tomb. A grand staircase, its banister carved with twisting vines, ascended to the upper floors, each step groaning as if protesting their passage. “Your room is on the second floor,” Mr. Hawthorne said, his polished shoes clicking on the polished wood. “One of our finest, with a view of the garden.” The room was small but high-ceilinged, its faded floral wallpaper curling at the edges. A four-poster bed, draped in worn velvet, dominated the space, flanked by a washstand with a chipped porcelain basin and pitcher. A heavy wardrobe, its mirror warped and spotted, stood against one wall, while a writing desk by a narrow window offered a view of the tangled garden below. A threadbare rug, its pattern faded to a ghostly outline, covered the creaking floorboards. But it was the corner opposite the bed that seized Emily's attention. The walls met at an angle that defied logic—neither right nor acute, but something in between, shifting subtly when she blinked. The wallpaper's floral pattern twisted near the corner, petals morphing into grotesque faces, mouths open in silent screams. A cold draft seeped from the space, carrying a faint hum that vibrated in her bones. Emily blinked, attributing the illusion to the dim light of the oil lamp, but the sense of wrongness lingered, a knot of dread in her chest. “It's charming,” she said, her voice wavering. Mr. Hawthorne's smile tightened, his eyes glinting with something unreadable. “Dinner is at seven. Do make yourself at home.” As he left, the door clicked shut with a finality that echoed in her chest, and she felt the weight of unseen eyes settle upon her. Emily unpacked her books—tomes on Victorian social history, architectural journals, and her great-grandmother's worn diary—arranging them on the desk. The room's furnishings, relics of the 19th century, included a chamber pot tucked discreetly under the bed and a tin bathtub in the corner, a reminder of the era's lack of modern plumbing. The wardrobe's mirror reflected her face with a slight distortion, her hazel eyes appearing too large, too vulnerable. She tried to focus on her research, but the feeling of being watched was inescapable, as if the portraits in the hallway had followed her into the room. Later, needing to shake off the travel dust and the pervasive chill of the house, Emily decided to brave the tin bathtub. She filled it with water, the metallic clang echoing in the quiet room, and added a few drops of lavender oil she'd brought, hoping to counteract the scent of decay. The steam rose, momentarily softening the harsh edges of the room, clinging to her skin like a second atmosphere. Emily shed her clothes, the cool air raising goosebumps on her arms, revealing the graceful curve of her back and the delicate line of her shoulders.

I took Fluconazole for 2 months straight every day. After rounds of antibiotics. It was eating at my mind. And the only person in my corner is my husband, who I am NOT implying isn't enough, but what about my family? The coworkers that I thought were family to me. . telling everyone I was on drugs.

Borough Market 4.18am This is the exact time that my alarm goes off. I've calculated that gives me exactly enough time to be ready for the gym. I am woken up either by my phone alarm or my Whoop band. The first thing I do when I wake up is check my phone. It's bad, I know, but I need to check that there have been no disasters overnight that need my attention. I then brush my teeth and put on some SPF. Garnier Ambre Solaire SPF 50+ Sensitive Advanced Sun Cream Face & Body is my current go-to. My morning soundtrack is anything by Beyoncé, I love the latest album even more after seeing her live. I also take a shot of Symprove before I leave. 4.50am My gym is only a six-minute drive from my house. In summer I wear shorts and a bra top to work out in. Most of my kit comes from lululemon, Oner Active and Sweaty Betty. I work out a minimum of five times a week, mixing it up with cardio, strength training and PT sessions. When I am strength training, I wear Nike Metcons and for running, I wear Nike Journey. 6am I have my protein shake as soon as I get back from the gym. It's a mixture of protein powder, collagen and creatine with water. I then go and give my children a cuddle before heading into the shower. My favourite body wash is Naturium The Glow Getter  Body Wash  followed by the body butter. I go in quickly with a spritz of my favourite scent, Encelade by Marc-Antoine Barrois. On my face, I use Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant followed by Koba moisturiser. Make-up starts with Danessa Myricks Beauty Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder and I always use Fenty's  foundation – it's the best. I use the By Terry eye liner and I mix blushers from Merit and NARS. Finally, I set everything with Charlotte Tilbury's setting spray and in the evenings, I use the one from ONE/SIZE. 7am I'm definitely a magpie but my style is also defined by clean lines. I find Lisa Ing Marinelli's take on fashion really inspiring – she's someone who also has a corporate job but embraces her personal style. If I had an endless budget, I would go to Tove every season. I just bought one of my favourite summer dresses from the brand. I'm also a big fan of Rejina Pyo. On the high street, I love COS and Massimo Dutti.

mov_4305250DC8A045CBC83691FCF57A0A21,"  A man who is attempting to run a marathon in every English city over the course of a year was inspired to raise money for a cancer charity after his mother endured her own cancer journey and he runs his Brighton one this Saturday (19 July) Adam Rodriguez, 28, from Bath, began his epic 55 marathon challenge on Saturday 5 July in Hereford “A few years ago my mother bravely battled large B-cell lymphoma in 3 places and while she survived, the journey tested every part of our family. A reminder of the quiet, relentless strength it takes to face cancer, not just for those diagnosed but for everyone who loves them. I'm passionate about trying to raise money for Move Against Cancer because they bring hope, movement and community to people navigating the weight of cancer, reminding us that no one goes through it alone. I'm doing this challenge to see every corner of England, to test both my body and my mind, and to embrace the adventure that comes with pushing beyond comfort – one marathon, once city, and one story at a time”. Adam will travel to 55 cities across England between July 2025 and July 2026. His final marathon will be in Salisbury on 28 June 2026. He'll be doing a marathon in London the day before so will finish with a double marathon weekend! Adam works full-time so the marathons will be run on a Saturday or Sunday and tracked using a Strava device. “I've always been active and I've always loved running”, he says. “In terms of the fitness side of things, I've run many marathons and half marathons before. Although it won't be easy I'm confident I can make it work!” Throughout the year-long challenge Adam is planning to meet ambassadors and participants from MOVE Against Cancer's 5k Your Way initiative. On the last Saturday of the month, at designated parkruns, anyone impacted by cancer is welcome to join a 5KYW group and walk, jog or run as much or as little of the route as they wish. Some simply come to volunteer and others come for coffee but everyone comes for the support. Adam says he's looking forward to meeting participants and hearing about their groups. “It's going to be such an honour joining the participants and ambassadors of 5KYW across the country. These are the people creating community, encouragement and strength at a local level and I'm excited to hear their stories, share the miles with them and highlight the real impact Move Against Cancer is making on the ground”. Training is going well but the real challenge, he says, will be recovery, especially on the few weekends where he's got two marathons back to back. “The funny thing about marathon training is, no matter how hard you go at it, 26.2 miles always finds a way to humble you. I'm having to be super sensible with how I train, fuel and rest, even if my legs would prefer a lie-down and a cuppa. Add in the joy of British weather and the odd city that feels more like a mountain range, and it's shaping up to be quite the adventure!” Adam's mum Sharon is thrilled about her son's forthcoming marathon adventure “Adam loves a challenge. I have every faith he will complete this and look forward to watching his journey!” Adam has been to several of the cities on his list before but the one he's looking forward to visiting the most is Newcastle as it'll be his first time there. “I've always found something iconic about the north east spirit, and the chance to run across the Tyne Bridge is going to be a real moment. Plus, the Geordie support is second to none, so I might need to rely on this energy if times are getting tough!” MOVE Against Cancer's Fundraising Officer Sophie Mulligan says Adam's commitment is hugely admirable. “He's given up a whole year of weekends to take on this epic challenge and to do it in support of MOVE Against Cancer means so much to us. Any donations to spur Adam on will go directly into supporting and inspiring those affected by cancer to live an active, fulfilling life.

I have been trying to uncover the source of my illness for a decade. My bones were eaten alive by this stuff. I've had two hip replacements and a total ankle replacement. So far. NO ONE BELIEVES MY ISSUES ARE REAL AFTER ALL THIS. I have been placed in psychiatric wards 6 times for weeks on end instead of treated for it. Ironically. It works because staying indoors at a facility where there is constant filtration, I of course start to get better. I have been diagnosed with bipolar and schizophrenia but it's all due to the exposure. At first I thought it was just in my home but then I realized it's in our environment outside as well. I live in southern Georgia. At night this haze covers the sky. It's in the haze. People think I'm crazy but it's true. UV light works, supplements work, infared light therapy works but the problem I've found is that everything becomes resistant. The most amazing fighter I've found is a 10 in 1 organic mushroom complex. It fixes all the issues associated with mold toxicity. I don't know if it will continue to work but I was almost unable to walk and as soon as I took this my joints became free and I literally passed fungal matter in my feces. Disgusting I know. Sad reality is that we could all be cured if we could just move to the damn beach. It doesn't thrive in salt air environments. I'm almost to the point of leaving my entire life behind to go be homeless near the coast. It might not be comfortable but atleast I would be alive. Also, side note. CASTILE SOAP. 100 percent pure Castile. Not Dr bronners. Bronners works but it gets too touch on your immune response to use it for removing it from your skin. Anyways, Buy a damn loaf of it off Amazon for 25 dollars. Go home. Cut off a 2 inch size bar. Go run a bath. Melt the entire bar in the tub. Get in the tub. Lay in it and submerge yourself as best you can. Rub every single inch of your body from head to toe while in that bath. You will feel it literally slide out of your skin. When you are done let the tub drain....while still sitting there. Let all the water drain and then immediately stand up and shower off rinsing whatever's left off your body. If you sit in it too long it will reabsorb in your skin. In my home it's airborne so at this point for me I'm literally trying to keep a sinking cruise ship floating with a 20 oz cup to throw the water with. I'm not sure how this all ends for me. At this point I don't like to think about it. As for now I'm just taking it one day at a time. Dancing, shaking, moving, attacking, blocking and running....","Listen. I am you. You are me.

1m3j870,"  My girlfriend has a strange new hobby, and I am getting close to sounding the relationship's alarms  and ending things. We've been together for 7 years; for 3, she attended nursing school while I lifted the financial burden to keep us going, then she did the same for me while I furthered my education. We both work in the same hospital, though our shifts rarely overlap. We are financially stable and in great place emotionally, until the last few weeks. Why am I telling you our background? For two reasons: First, I'm trying to convay that we are normal, responsible adults. We have been through everything together, and a relationship like this isn't thrown away because of a weird hobby that developed over the last few weeks, right? The second is to explain that the nature of our jobs is one that requires a deep desensitization to blood, gore, and things that the general public perceives as ""gross"". This is important. Prior to 4 weeks ago, our life entered the monotnous but common synchronized schedule of an adult couple. We functioned like clockwork, aligning work, family, friends, meals, sleep, and exercise without a thought. There wasn't much change in our day-to-day events, but we liked it that way. 4 weeks ago, I came home from my shift at the hospital and expected to be greeted by the aroma of dinner on the stove, music playing, and a loving girlfriend. I didn't find any of that. I passed the threshold and found myself smelling and hearing nothing. I called for her, but got no response. I walked to our backdoor that overlooks our backyard and found her kneeling on the grass, facing away from me. ""Babe, everything okay?"" I asked, grass crunching under my shoes, an oddly satisfying feeling that I always enjoyed. No response. ""Babe?"" I reached out and touched her shoulder gently. Her head was facing down, back arched, staring at something she held in her hands. She appeared to be lost in a trance, awoken only by my touch. She looked up at me, tears in her eyes that made me melt. However, my eyes went to what was in her hands instantly. Cradled in her two opened hand was a relatively large crow, stiff with death, eyes staring forward void of life. Across its chest, beginning below its head, reaching its belly, was an open gash that exposed the bird's intestines through a puddle of blood that pooled beyond my girlfriend's hands and onto our grass. ""What..."" I began, but she began sobbing. She explained that she had seen the injured bird through the kitchen window. It flapped around endlessly on the yard, and when she went to inspect, she saw a trail of blood and innards. She asked to keep the body in the bathtub or our guest bathroom, so she could inspect the bird's anatomy. That's normal physician curiosity, right? I didn't think so, but I didn't say anything. This was the first of 5 different dead animals that are currently laying in my bath tub. They all have the same opening down their belly, and they're all stiff with death. 4 days after the crow, I came home to find her on our driveway, holding a dead squirrel. The following week, she ran into our house, asking for help with a dead Yorky puppy that she saws get runover during her evening run. Days later,she walked into our house with a dead cat. And 4 nights ago, I came home to find her dragging the corpse of a large stray dog that I had seen sniffing around our trashcans. She looked derranged, unrecognizable even. Her face was blank, emotionless, as she dragged a 60 pound corpse through our sidewalk onto our driveway, leaving a trail of fresh blood behind her. Her hair was wild and messy, giving the image of a savage cavewoman. I ran towards her screaming a hundred different questions, but she simply said ""Put it in the bathtub with the others."" I figured she is going through some emotional breakdown that's manifesting in a strange way. This isn't unheard of in hospitals, sure. Maybe I was being naive, but I chalked it up to something that can be fixed with a therapist. However last night, I woke up in the middle of the night. The streetlight krept through our windows, just enough to illuminate the image that has been haunting me every second of my day.

n3yyx0v,"  Couple things I used to point out to my assistant STs when I was running LARPs and they'd get a bit too worried about what counts as a Masquerade breach and what doesn't. 1. We all see crazy things “caught on film” all the time. More often than not, someone will call it a hoax, or we accept it as something kooky that happened, or we forget about it quickly (when was the last Harlem Shake video you watched?) , but I've NEVER heard anyone go, “Hey, I wonder if that person in that video was a vampire?” Maybe it was adrenaline, or PCP, or bath salts. Aliens? Ghosts? Sometimes, but it's never vampires. 2. A real life story hit the news the other day about a law student who kept trying to bite her fellow interns at a work function. Is she crazy? Dumb? I don't know, but NO ONE has speculated vampirism yet. 3. People do NOT want to believe in the supernatural usually. They'll come up with a million other explanations first. For that one person in a hundred who does think it's supernatural, they're going to sound crazy to anyone they tell before you hunt them down. And that's my big advice to YOU: relax and find ways to explain it away. You threw a gang banger across the room? Of course, look at the size of you! Shot and didn't kill you? Thank god for that helmet and body armor. Do what you've got to do to survive, and trust in your victim's ability to wave away most of what you do. For the ones that don't, you'll have to play clean up so you don't get caught.

1m3y7yd,"  Hear me out and please don't let this get out of reddit. Last December, my father had a stroke. His heart and his brain was so affected to the point na half of his body was basically deteriorating. Everything was so sudden. One moment, okay lang siya and then the next sumisigaw na siya sa sakit. We rushed him sa hospital but after a few days, they told us walang hospital sa province namin ang may capacity to give him the medical care that he needed. It was either Cebu or Manila. There goes our first problem. We had to airlift him or else mamatay talaga siya if we made that trip by land. The air ambulance cost us half a million agad, not counting pa the hospital bill dito sa province namin which was also costly kasi nasa ICU siya. By the grace of God, nailipad namin siya. We exhausted all our resources and connections para may mag receive sa kanya sa PHC. Our second problem was that since naka charity siya sa PHC, ang haba pa ng pila ng ooperahan. They advised us to go home after a few months. Bedridden pa din father ko and unresponsive that time. My mother had to fly back forth dito and Manila. One week siya magbabantay dun and then babalik dito para mag work and the cycle continues for six months. Inilaban niya talaga na hindi uuwi because that would cost us a million pesos going back and forth. My mother decided to shift him to private para mauna ang operation niya. But for that, we had to gather at least 2 million pesos to show na may capacity kami to pay for the operation. It involved a whole team of doctors to make a decision kung go ba ang operation or hindi. So ayun, we sent out letters everywhere, to any politician who would hear us out and give money. Even those I didn't vote for. The operation was a success pero ayon nga, my biggest problem now is that andito na siya sa bahay. We paid more than 4 million pesos for his 6 month stay sa hospital. Alam ko sobrang exhausted na ng finances namin because I have access and manage some of them. As in, wala na kaming pera HAHA. Every week, we need to shell out at least 5k for his meds and food kasi naka tube lang siya. Ang mahal ng gamot niya pero mas mahal ang gatas niya. Dagdag ko pa yung side ng family ng tatay ko na walang tulong. Humihiram kami ng pera, ang daming excuses parang hindi nila kamaganak tatay ko. We are asking for someone sa side nila to bantay sa hospital, wala din. May pumayag pero kailangan pa bayaran. Sa side ng nanay ko, they were so ready to lend us money. May utang pa kami sa kanila na almost half a million pero hindi naniningil. They understand our situation daw. May pinsan pa siya na pumayag magalaga sa manila na walang bayad. Siya pa nagdadala ng pagkain etc. I recently graduated and parang wala na akong nakikita sa future ko kasi parang expected na kami magaalaga sa kanya. My sister na younger sa akin actually had to fly to manila and take care of him for a whole month while my mother worked para maiuwi siya dito sa amin. I had to take care of our youngest sister here and maniguro na maka graduate ako this July. Grabeng sacrifice ginagawa namin. Every four hours need mag feed. Every day may kailangan palitan na dressing, trache, etc. Every other day we need to change his clothes na lethargic and basically vegetative state siya. Every week we need to clean up his poop and give him a bath all while he's in bed. Napaka demanding ng care na kailangan niya.

mov_3A7DA735D566AF4BA596FDC1F8702256,"  Horoscope Today 20 July 2025 offers key revelations under the intense influence of a Scorpio Moon and transformative Mercury-Pluto energy. Whether you're a grounded Earth sign like Taurus or Virgo, or a dreamy Water sign like Pisces or Cancer, today's energy favors deep conversations, hidden truths, and mental breakthroughs. Let's see what the stars are saying for your sign today. How the intense Scorpio Moon influences your emotions today With the Moon in intense Scorpio, emotions run deep, instincts sharpen, and surface-level interactions just won't cut it. Scorpio energy craves truth, transformation, and emotional depth. Whether you're reconnecting with someone, confronting an inner fear, or just sensing something unspoken, this lunar influence encourages you to dig beneath the surface. Expect a strong pull toward privacy, passion, and power—but be careful not to slip into control or secrecy. Use this time to embrace vulnerability and trust your gut. What Mercury-Pluto energy reveals in thoughts and communication As Mercury aligns with transformative Pluto, thoughts become sharper, words carry more weight, and mental clarity begins to emerge. This is a day for breakthroughs—especially in conversations that have felt stuck or superficial. If you're a logical Earth sign like Taurus or Virgo, or a sensitive Water sign like Pisces or Cancer, you'll feel this energy pushing you to speak your truth or uncover something hidden. This cosmic combo supports deep discussions, powerful realizations, and uncovering the real story behind the scenes. ♈ Aries Horoscope Today – 20 July 2025 Today, Aries, emotional currents run deeper than usual. The Scorpio Moon stirs past insecurities, especially around trust and control. At work, double-check details before moving forward on a major project. Conversations with a close friend or partner may take a serious turn—be open, but don't overreact. Financially, avoid impulsive purchases and keep your budget tight. Your energy may dip slightly by evening, so avoid overextending yourself. It's a good day to recharge, reflect, and let go of emotional baggage. Let intuition guide rather than ego. A deep breath can shift everything. ♉ Taurus Horoscope Today – 20 July 2025 Taurus, your relationships are in the cosmic spotlight today.

mov_9E1DA0CA0D925CEDACF5F434DB342696,"  As Finn Russell's mispass hung in the Brisbane night air looping over the heads of four Australian defenders, Sione Tuipulotu had a sudden feeling of deja vu. During the ball's two-second hangtime, the Scotland centre realised he had seen this movie before. Seven years earlier, Russell threw what might well be the pass of the century in a 2018 Calcutta Cup match against England that skimmed Jonathan Joseph's outstretched fingertips before landing into the path of an accelerating Huw Jones. Again Tuipulotu just had to run on to Russell's pass to effectively put the first Test to bed after just eight minutes. “He threw a pretty similar pass a few years ago against England to Huw Jones off his left hand,” Tuipulotu said. “It was kind of weird, when he was throwing it I was kind of thinking of that, thinking he was going to throw it into that space. I didn't have to do much, just had to accelerate and catch the ball. That's why playing with special players is pretty cool. His nature helps everyone and calms everyone. Then you add to that that he's got one of the best skillsets of any 10 in the world, it's a joy to play with.” This is already shaping up to be the summer of Finn. After winning the Premiership title with Bath, he is using this Lions tour to cement his reputation as the best fly-half in the world. After years of being variously dismissed as flaky and flashy, the Scotland playmaker is now showing he has the temperament as well as the talent. While head coach Andy Farrell made a point of praising him for not getting “bored of doing the right thing”, it is his glorious range of passing that had former Lions fly-halves Ronan O'Gara and Dan Biggar purring in the Sky Sports commentary box. Lee Blackett, his attack coach at Bath, says there are two things that make Russell's distribution so special. Firstly, his natural wrist strength. For the pass to Tuipulotu, there is minimal wind-up off his left hand to throw the ball 20 metres at a velocity where there is no risk of an intercept. Secondly, and more importantly, as Blackett told my colleague Charlie Morgan, his ability to catch-pass – how quickly he gets the ball in and out of his hands – is phenomenal. According to Blackett, a large part of Russell's technique was honed over the course of 15 weeks in Christchurch in 2013. Under the John MacPhail Scholarship, a couple of young Scotland players are sent abroad to study from the best of the best, which for Russell and Sam Hidalgo-Clyne meant heading to New Zealand to rub shoulders with the likes of Dan Carter and Richie McCaw. As part of the internship, Russell played for Lincoln University under coach John Haggart, who runs Canterbury's International High Performance Unit. “Finn wasn't your typical driven high performing academy boy coming out of a private school. He worked as a stone mason,” Haggart tells Telegraph Sport. “He loved a beer. He loved being around students. He loved enjoying himself after a game. Because of the environment he was in, he was able to flourish rather than being restricted by boundaries.” As much as Russell enjoyed himself – and Haggart still shudders about the thought of him perched precariously upon the back of Hidalgo-Clyne's moped – there was serious work to be done. In the Canterbury set-up, they practice the basic building blocks of passing, catching and running with almost religious fervour. “We would do a lot of work on our 'no witnesses, only work-ons',” Haggart said. “You spend time before training and after training just working on fundamental run-catch-pass. Sometimes that would be a static run-catch-pass or walking-run-catch-pass. When Finn came out, he had an opportunity as a young man in the 15 weeks that he was over here just to spend time on his run-catch-pass. “Spending time on those fundamentals was a really high priority for us at that time during the Dan Carter era. It was really important for a 10 who could catch early, eyes up with his cone of vision looking ahead to see what can give him the opportunity to do what's next. “We work on the technical side of catching the ball on your fingertips and shifting the ball quickly across your body rather than catching, reloading and then falling away. It is pretty simple stuff but because he was at a stage of learning in his life he was able to adopt those principles really quickly and put that into practice.” Go back a few phases before Tuipulotu's try and Russell plucks Furlong's pass out of the air with his right hand before releasing Dan Sheehan with an inside ball in the teeth of the Australian defence, which would have felt familiar to the Carter-era Crusaders side. “Catch early, carry centre and you either shift quickly or you are catching it flat like Finn loves to do which really tests the defences,” Haggart said. “I think catching early and catching flat with such quick hands enables him to put people into space while holding defence lines off him.” What Haggart also noted was Russell's improvisation. After receiving an offload from Furlong, Russell originally shapes to send a cross kick towards wing Tommy Freeman, but in less than a second he notices that full-back Tom Wright had drifted across leaving the space for him to pull the trigger to Tuipulotu. It was this ability to adapt to a changing picture as much as the execution of the pass which earned a gushing tribute from O'Gara, the La Rochelle head coach on Sky Sports. “You have a gameplan but the first try isn't in the gameplan,” O'Gara said. “That's when you know you have a gem on your hands and he plays the situation in front of him. In the olden days it is a skip six to Sione.” Haggart had no doubt that Russell was destined for greater things and perhaps the most intriguing subtext to the end of his time at Lincoln University, where he won the player of the year award, was that there was a serious push from figures inside the Canterbury organisation to keep him in New Zealand. “Canterbury had spoken to me and we had spoken to Finn about the possibility of him extending his stay here and I know Canterbury were very keen to bring him in,” Haggart said. “But he was under contract and we had a long-standing relationship with the SRU that we needed to respect. If he had been out here on his own I am sure Canterbury would have hidden his passport and said you are not going anywhere.”","As Finn Russell's mispass hung in the Brisbane night air looping over the heads of four Australian defenders, Sione Tuipulotu had a sudden feeling of deja vu.

1m4wigr,"  It started with the rain. Not the kind that dashes against glass in a fit of temper, nor the hurried drizzle of an indecisive sky. No—this was a lover's rain. Slow. Rhythmic. It arrived just after nine, weaving itself into the air like silk threads pulled through dusk. Camille heard it first, a soft percussive whisper on the balcony tiles, then saw it—thin silver needles falling against the velvet dark, streaking the city into something softer, slower, more forgiving. She stood by the window, fingers curled loosely around the stem of a wine glass, the red within as deep and dark as a secret. The city below was a reflection of her mood: lit, but dim. Buzzing, but distant. She exhaled, her breath painting a pale bloom on the cold pane, and felt the quiet settle around her shoulders like a shawl she'd forgotten she owned. There would be no plans tonight. The message had gone out hours ago. A migraine, she'd told them. Work stress. The need to decompress. Everyone had accepted the excuse—her voice was low and distant enough that no one thought to press. Camille was good at that. Crafting distance. Building space around herself like architecture. Not out of coldness. Out of preservation. The truth was simpler. She didn't want to go out. She didn't want to dress up, to smile, to nod through jokes that landed without grace. She didn't want to be adored, or touched, or entertained. She wanted stillness. Camille turned away from the window and crossed the open-plan apartment at a slow pace, each bare footstep a quiet ceremony on the hardwood floor. Her home smelled of sandalwood and something faintly citrus, a scent that clung to the back of her throat in the most comforting way. The lighting was low—intentional pools of amber dotted across the space, illuminating only what needed to be seen. A single candle flickered on the coffee table. She passed it without haste and padded toward the bathroom. There, she drew a bath. Not quickly. She let the water run hot and slow, added a stream of lavender oil, then a generous scoop of salts the colour of amethyst. The steam rose instantly, fogging the mirror, curling around her like fingers. When she slipped in, her entire body sighed. She didn't rush. She never did. Time wasn't a taskmaster tonight—it was an offering. Camille sank deeper, water cradling her breasts, slicking her shoulders, kissing the tops of her thighs. Her hair floated like a halo. She closed her eyes. Outside, the rain's tempo continued, steady as a heartbeat. She soaked until the water cooled and her fingers wrinkled like secrets too long held. Then she stood, water sliding down her in rivulets, and reached for a towel plush enough to rival fur. She wrapped it around herself, not in haste, but like an afterthought. The robe came next.
