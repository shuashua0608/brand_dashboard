mov_FDC5C0CA77CAAAB35AA0E444F40BD078,"  Just keep these links handy, because friends *will* be asking you to share the goods. 1. Some afforable Eos Shea Butter Vanilla Cashmere body lotion that TikTokers are tripping over themselves to get as they swear it moisturizes and smells as good as much more expensive options from brands like Philosophy and Bath & Body Works. Promising reviews: ""I first saw this lotion on TikTok; an influencer was bragging about it! Let me tell you, she did not lie. This lotion is the BEST. It smells fantastic. A cross between cotton candy and vanilla, it's just so fresh. It makes my skin smooth all day. This large bottle will last me a couple of months. Thank you, Eos, for such a fantastic lotion.  "" —Erin ""Very similar to my Burberry fragrance, and they layer beautifully. I always get tons of compliments on the scent. I also purchase the jasmine and berry  for a more fruity option but to me it just smells like regular lotion. Cost per use is well worth it considering how thick the lotion is. It also actually moisturizes while leaving a fragrance behind instead of drying my skin out due to the perfume. I have sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions."" —Violet Frahm Get it from Amazon for $9.97 (available in various scents and packs). 2. A tube of Essence's Lash Princess Mascara to give you a falsies-level look for less than five bucks. It seems questionable, I know, but for confirmation, you need only look at the 262,000+ 5-star reviews!! Promising review: ""After using Lights, Camera, Lashes by Tarte for the past year, I got tired of breaking the bank over mascara. My sister suggested Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect and I IMMEDIATELY fell in love. It provides dramatic length and great volume. I can honestly say I can't stop looking at my eyelashes in the mirror every single day because of how awesome they look. Also, it is very long-wearing. I go from an eight-hour workday right to the gym and sweat [a lot]. . and this stuff doesn't budge! I love it!!"" —Carrie E Weikert Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (available in black or brown and as a three-pack). 3. A long-sleeve bodysuit in a deliciously soft fabric — known as Smoke Cloud — that reviewers compare to Skims. They say it washes well, too, so you can count on it being high quality despite the deceivingly low price! And BTW, reviewers say the double lining in the torso is supportive, so they don't need to wear a bra. Promising review: ""Are you kidding me? This is the softest, most comfortable body suit I've ever owned. I got so many compliments lol; everyone did think they were Skims lol, but it's definitely worth every penny. I love and will be getting more colors!!! You need it."" —Wendy L. Get it from Amazon for $28.99 (available in women's sizes XS–3X and 13 colors). And check out all the styles available in the Smoke Cloud fabric here. 4. Elizavecca's Collagen Coating Hair Protein Treatment — it works just like a hair mask to repair your locks in five minutes flat. The ceramide 3- and collagen-packed formula repairs all types of hair, whether you've got over-processed tresses or 4c hair that's susceptible to dryness. Reviewers even say the $8 product is comparable to Olaplex No. 3!...","Just keep these links handy, because friends *will* be asking you to share the goods. 1.

1m2hr5n,  So I bought 7 soaps from bath and body works since they were running a sale on them. Ordered them 3 weeks ago and they came today when I was at work and my dad sent me a picture and the package had been torn up and I was missing a soap. I went to B&BW website and got the auto message robot and it said “come back in two business days. Make sure to check bushes and hidden spots.” … what it was stolen what do you mean. So than I went to UPS website and firstly I had to send 5 emails for confirmation codes and none of them worked. So than I just exited out and went back in and luckily it still made my profile. I had to file a claim and when I was there it put in my tracking number and it took me to a different thing saying I had to file a cargo claim. And it was asking me all these questions about cargo and it had different numbers and letters to it. JUST LET ME SPEAK TO A PERSON IT WAS STOLEN DUDE. it's not that hard like either send me a new one or give me a refund. The only robot that can do their job is amazons robot which who knows Amazon might have actual people but I'm just so frustrated. Like I've already had a day on its own. My morning started rough than I cried at work and dropped my lunch on the ground so had no lunch for my 12 hour shift.
