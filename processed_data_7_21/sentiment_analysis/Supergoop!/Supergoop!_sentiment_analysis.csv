EAF08F5EC939AAFE9B96F88DE3FB95CB,"  MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage (I charge from £1,150 for mine). Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 (£19.55, www.amazon.co.uk), Olaplex No.8 (£22.40, www.sephora.co.uk) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer (£21, www.boots.com). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner (£27, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner (£26, www.harrods.com). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now £17.99, sha op.toni www.ndguy.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now £12, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo (£24.50, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment (£25). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

n33mu9w,"  Task stacking! My evening routine is where my heavy hitters are. And I save the majority of my social media usage for night time, so I can catch up with stuff while I'm doing my evening routine. Or saving a show or podcast for only that time. It's my ""me time"" for the day, so I take my time and decompress from the day and have really built a routine that I enjoy and look forward to doing. Helps give the task more dopamine. For mornings, the key is honestly to give yourself more time to do things slowly. I wake up earlier than I need to so my morning is padded with time if I just want to sit and read for a half an hour with my tea before getting going. And I keep my routine simple for the days I don't have the energy to do the whole song and dance. It looks something like this: * Quick shower (I have curly hair and only wash 1-2x per week) * Get face wet in shower * Rose water toner * Moisturizer * Glowscreen (tinted SPF from SuperGoop) * I have lash extensions specifically for this reason so I can stop here if I'm short on time or spoons, and still feel presentable * If I have time and am feeling it, I will do more involved makeup. And again, youtube, podcasts, audiobooks, RedNote with it's autoscroll feature are going to be key here. Pair the self care and getting ready with another task you enjoy. But remember to keep it moving, don't sit down and start getting super invested in something. Your media needs to be something you can have as a background.","Task stacking!

mov_F2E5255AF9152C63857A9633D6E62F7E,"  After all, we are in the season of ~glowing. ~ 1. A vitamin C and antioxidant-rich serum that'll help brighten your skin. This serum uses vitamin C, collagen, sodium hyaluronate, and lavender oil, all of which will help your skin look super glowy. Promising review: ""I ordered this product after a colleague had recommended it. I had developed some acne and scarring from wearing a face mask. Most of the acne was around my cheek area. Once masks weren't required anymore, I was a bit embarrassed by my skin's condition. I've only ever used face wash and didn't know the importance of moisturizing. This has helped clear up my skin and even it out. I've been using it for about four months now and only have very minimal scarring left. The price is worth it. I have actually been using it daily and use about 3–4 drops a day. Still have over half the bottle left. Definitely a good investment. It has a light fragrance and will help your skin look dewy without feeling oily."" —Lupita Luna Get it from Amazon for $31.50. 2. A skincare starter kit for those who need help setting up their routine. It comes with a gel cleanser, serum, and hydrating cream that'll help smooth your face and brighten it. It's glowy skin season, and there's no one I trust more for glowy skin than the Queen of Glow herself, J.Lo. Promising review: ""I usually don't order skin products from celebrities, but I happened to come across a review from a makeup artist who raved about this product. I decided to give it a try. These products are great. Leaves your skin soft and hydrated with a nice glow. Not greasy looking or shiny. I have applied foundation after applying, and it does not affect the foundation. Great product."" —christine Get the set from Amazon for $201. 3. A glowy sunscreen because once you start using this, you won't be able to stop (trust me, I know from experience.) Every single time I wear this glowy SPF, I instantly get a confidence boost, and everyone compliments me. I am a Glowscreen stan, I use this almost every day, and the amount of compliments I receive while wearing this are unreal. Like I said above, once I have this on, I feel like a glowing goddess, and it makes me want to do a mini photoshoot. So I hope it inspires you as much as it inspires me. Promising review: ""I have been on a search for a sunscreen that doesn't burn my eyes and skin, and I have finally found that with Supergoop. I don't wear much makeup on a daily basis, so this tinted sunscreen is what I use on the daily to give a tiny bit of glow. I actually went with the bronze because it is so sheer. I absolutely love the way it makes my skin look. I highly recommend this product."" —LizDT Get it from Sephora for $22+ (available in three sizes and four shades). 4. A bottle of The Ordinary's viral blood-red exfoliating peeling solution since you never really got over your vampire phase. For under $10, this does a lot! It can help you with blemishes, improve your skin texture, and keep your skin glowy.

397059B84031EE2F45D751CA8833E1A2,"  by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage. Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 ((EURO)29.50, www.brownthomas.com), Olaplex No.8 ((EURO)29.50, www.arnotts.ie) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer ((EURO)24.45, www.lookfantastic.ie). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner ((EURO)31, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner ((EURO)30, www.boots.ie). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now (EURO)22.49, www.cloud10beauty.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now (EURO)14, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo ((EURO)28.20, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment ((EURO)28). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

mov_7AD64E646EA8A32B8C92BBA829236A0C,"  38 items in this article 38 items on sale! Photo-Illustration: The Strategist; Photos: Retailers Nordstorm's Anniversary Sale is one of my favorite sales of the year, so I went all in for today's end-of-week roundup. The beauty deals are always good, and you often find brands that don't get discounted throughout the year in the mix (like Natori, Bombas, and Ecco, to name a few). Speaking of beauty, we just got word that Ami Colé is closing down, so now's the time to stock up; its sale section is an extra 25 percent off until stock runs out. And if neither of those sales is for you, I found plenty more double discounts at Levi's, Madewell, Nordstrom Rack, and Anthropologie. Our best brief doesn't go on sale much, so I'd suggest stocking up while its 25 percent off. I finally hopped on the American Trench train and bought a pair of their socks a few weeks ago. I highly recommend; they're surprisingly breathable despite the thick sole and squishy upper part. This set of three is just $9 apiece. Sale items are an extra 40 percent off at checkout at Anthropologie. There are lots of options from Anthropologie's in-house lines, as usual, like this stretchy tank that's now $12. Sale styles are an extra 50 percent off at Levi's at the moment. If you must wear pants during the summer, I say go wtih the baggiest ones you can find — these Levi's are a strong contender. Another wide-leg, this time courtesy of Madewell, where lots of on-sale jeans are an extra 50 percent off with the code SUMMER. This is a good wash option if you don't want to pay hundreds for Japanese selvedge denim. These inky blue jeans since we wrote about them in March (a.k.a. Jeans Month) are also $50 — which is $7 cheaper than when I spotted them on sale last month. No code needed to score these jeans from Madewell's collection with Alexa Chung. Photo: Retailer Strategist contributor Sable Yong owns four pairs of these Gap jeans, which she says are, despite the semi-intimidating horseshoe shape, “casually flowy while not swallowing my footwear in their gaping maws.” If you're in the market for comfy shoes, the Nordstrom sale has quite a few options, like these unisex-fit dad sneakers from New Balance. Several actually cute Ecco sandals are on sale at Nordstrom, too, but you can also find the same discounts at Amazon and Zappos if you'd like two-day shipping. As for this heeled option, most sizes are $120 — but you're in luck if you're a size 10 to 10.5, because they're $88, a discount of 50 percent off! Everything in Camper's sale section is half off for members (which just requires you to sign up for emails). I'm eyeing these fisherman-esque sandals that have an especially cushy-looking sole. If you're looking for some non-basic swimsuits and coverups, Marie Oliver has some for up to 70 percent off. Continuing with some capsule wardrobe basics, this all-cotton tee is 40 percent off and comes in six nice neutrals. Two equally worthy denim shirts, depending on your wash preference. These unisex work shorts by Le Laboureur, a French family-owned brand that's been producing workwear since the 1950s, are over 40 percent off. They're made from cotton moleskin, a densely woven fabric with a sueded finish that develops a unique patina over time. We'll always recommend on-sale Supergoop! This three-pack of spritzable sunscreen is now just over $16 per bottle (normally $24). Under $100 La Mer alert! An excellent deal on Bathing Culture's moisture-trapping body oil. A nice-smelling natural deodorant that actually works, according to our associate editor Jeremy Rellosa. Sadly, Ami Colé is closing up shop. So its sale section, the Overflow Shelf, is an additional 25 percent off with the code OVERFLOW25. Grab the Telfar bag of lip gloss, a hydrating concealer, or a couple makeup brushes while you still can. Clearance items are an extra 25 percent off at Nordstrom Rack this weekend. I found some crazy-good deals on Hydro Flasks, like this 32-ounce bottle in white, indigo, and purple. (There's also one in teal on sale for $35.) Tekla who? Dorm essentials are 40 percent off at Urban Outfitters through the end of the weekend. I like this $41 cottage-inspired sheet set, which includes one pillowcase, a fitted sheet, and a flat sheet in the twin / twin XL size (bigger sizes come with two pillowcases). A huge step up from mesh laundry baskets. This is more apartment-y than dorm, but fun nonetheless. Finally, a fashion-forward apron. If you're shopping the Nordstrom sale, make sure to check out all the baby clothes on sale — there are a ton of cute onesies from brands we love like Magnetic Me and Pehr.
