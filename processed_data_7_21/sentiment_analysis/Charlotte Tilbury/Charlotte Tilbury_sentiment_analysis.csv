Now, beauty enthusiasts can snag eight of the celebrity makeup artist's products for half off as part of a limited-time deal. The brand has rolled out its Summer Icons Beauty Box, offering a rare opportunity to grab some of Charlotte's most adored makeup and skincare essentials at an almost unheard-of 50% discount. Unlike previous mystery boxes where the content was a surprise, this time Charlotte has disclosed every item in advance, so shoppers know exactly what they're investing in. The Summer Icons Beauty Box is a handpicked collection of Charlotte's most sought-after products, including seven full-size icons and a travel-sized Charlotte's Magic Cream, all neatly packed into a luxurious gift box. Valued at $233, it's priced at $116, meaning each item inside average at $14.50 apiece.

Shoppers will also receive the Hypnotising Pop Shot in Diamond Eyes, a sparkling champagne eyeshadow that adds instant glam. For lips, the Lip Lustre in Blondie provides a glossy, peachy-nude finish perfect for summer days or nights, while the Cheek to Chic blush in Ecstasy offers a radiant, soft-focus glow that flatters all skin tones, reports Liverpool Echo. Summer Icons Beauty Box Charlotte Tilbury Product Description In Charlotte's Summer Icons Beauty Box, discover the beauty icons you will adore – and not just for summer. Charlotte has curated a mystery box of summer beauty secrets with a magical 50% off, giving everyone, everywhere the secret to a gorgeous glow, all year round. The box also includes the Pillow Talk Eyeliner and Push Up Lashes Mascara Eye Kit for definition and lift without smudging - a summer essential for long, hot days. Rounding out the set is Charlotte's Magic Hydration Revival Cleanser, which dissolves makeup while hydrating the skin, and a travel-size Magic Cream, her top-selling moisturizer that plumps and preps your skin with a radiant finish. Mirror writer Beth reviewed Charlotte's Magic Hydration Revival Cleanser when it launched and said: ""The cleanser effortlessly removed makeup and impurities without stripping my skin of its natural moisture, and after rinsing it off, I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth and clear my skin felt."" However, she did note it had a ""sticky texture"", which she was not a fan of. Charlotte Tilbury isn't the only beauty retailer to embrace the new summer season as Sephora has launched its Vacay All Day Makeup Value Set. Worth $125, the kit costs $50 and includes nine must-haves to keep you hydrated and glowing all summer long. Or there's the Black Honey Makeup Vault Set available at Ulta Beauty. Coming in at $138, the four-piece set includes Clinique's cult-classic shade, plus Pink Honey Almost Lipstick all in a clutch. The Charlotte Tilbury edit is a good opportunity for die-hard fans to replenish their collection, or for newcomers to sample the brand's offerings at a significantly reduced price. The only hitch is that the shades are pre-determined, so they might not be your first choice, but generally, they seem to suit most skin tones without any outlandish colors. Now that all items have been unveiled and the price has been halved, shoppers can check out the Charlotte Tilbury summer set here.","Shoppers can save 50% on Charlotte Tilbury's Summer Icons Beauty Box Shawna Healey and Bethan Shufflebotham Senior Fashion and Beauty Writer This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

mov_DBB09078A48717073FC8B4944E3CE46A,"  While Amazon Prime Day may have wrapped up, Charlotte Tilbury's summer sale is still going strong and Irish shoppers can snap up some of the brand's most-loved products at huge discounts - including up to 50% off. One of the standout offers is the return of Charlotte's Mystery Boxes, packed with four full-size makeup and skincare favourites. There are two versions to choose from - 'Pretty Pink and 'Cheeky Peach - each tailored to a specific colour palette. Whether you love a rosey glow or a peachy finish, there's something here to suit your style. Each mystery box normally costs €131, but is now on sale for just €65 - or you can grab the duo for €130 (down from €260) if you want to mix and match. As the name suggests, the exact contents are a surprise - but Charlotte Tilbury has given a few hints. Promo images show silhouettes of what look like lipsticks (€37), blush palettes (€44), mascaras (€32) and possibly a skincare treat. And while shades and formulas are kept secret, everything will stick to either the pink or peach theme - great for summer makeup bags. Irish fans of the brand know these mystery drops tend to sell out fast, and previous versions have included everything from the Beautyverse Palette to Magic Cream minis, making them serious value for money. Elsewhere, LookFantastic's July beauty box - worth over €150 - is currently at €20 and contains products from Molten Brown, Avant, This Works and more. And the Boots' Festival Edit Beauty Bag is €55 and worth €190.95. With the likes of Milk Makeup, Too Faced, Kylie Cosmetics and more inside, it's a real treat that'll help cure any festival blues. While the new Charlotte Tilbury Mystery Boxes are a real treat regardless of what's inside, the only nuisance would be receiving a product that is not quite the right shade for the shopper's skin tone or type. If you'd prefer to know exactly what you're getting, there are plenty of other summer offers worth checking out. The Charlotte's Summer Icons Box is down to €117 from €235 and includes seven full-sized favourites, including the Matte Beauty Blush Wand, Pillow Talk eyeliner, Push Up Lashes mascara and a travel-sized Magic Cream. There's also the Hollywood Flawless Filter and Airbrush Flawless Foundation Duo for €52 (usually €104) - a cult combo beloved by makeup artists and influencers alike. Charlotte Tilbury's international shipping means Irish beauty lovers won't miss out, and delivery is available across the country for €3.95 - or free on orders over €59. Whether you're topping up your makeup bag or trying something new, this is a chance to bag luxury products at a fraction of the price.

mov_036EC18E7ACB83CA458E68138F9C7EB3,"  Balmy evenings call for a touch of golden-hour glamour – AVA WELSING-KITCHER shares 5 must-try makeup hacks for just the right amount of afterglow Go bold with your bronzer Going big on bronzer is a classic vacation look for a reason. Start with an understated formula, such as Charlotte Tilbury's Beautiful Skin Sun-Kissed Glow Bronzer, adding a fingerprint-sized amount inside the hollows of your cheeks, along your jawline and across your chin and temples. For a matte take, add a touch more across your eyelids and the bridge of your nose, before blending everything out with your fingertips. If a spot of shimmer is more your thing, swipe Westman Atelier's Lit Up Highlight Stick in Brûlée where you'd normally apply blusher, starting on the cheeks, just below your hairline and on the bridge of your nose and eyelids. Finish with a bold lip – there's nothing quite like a vibrant coral or crimson shade against bronzed skin to make your skin pop; Gucci Beauty's Odalie Red and Westman Atelier's Le Rouge are both worthy vacation wins. Look to molten eyes Matte eyeshadow and cat-eye liner are just too much on a balmy night – instead, look to metallic finishes that are easily blended with a fingertip should they settle into creases. Hourglass's Eyeshadow Stick in Solstice, a shimmery bronze, sets in mere minutes, so work quickly and on one eye at a time. You can then top lids with a powder metallic eyeshadow in a similar shade, or add a contrasting tone to transform it. Try Sisley's Les Phyto-Ombres Eyeshadow in Sparkling Topaz for a universally flattering copper finish while Charlotte Tilbury's Luxury Palette in Pillow Talk has all your vacation-ready shades in one. To complement the look, swipe a couple of fingers across your chosen shade and mix with a body oil in your hands to pick the hues out across limbs and décolletage; finish with fresh skin and lashings of brown mascara to keep everything soft yet defined. Dial down the base For perfect holiday skin, look for light textures (akin to moisturizers and serums) that offer slight coverage rather than a full on foundation. Charlotte Tilbury's Hollywood Flawless Filter has become a cult product for good reason: its hybrid formula combines the coverage of a tinted serum, the luminosity of a highlighter and the prepping power of a primer to deliver a softly diffused finish. Spot-conceal any blemishes or dark under-eye areas, then add a touch of Sisley's Blur Expert Powder to patches prone to sweat or oiliness. Glow head to toe Make the most of your new tan by adding luminosity to your body care, too, locking in moisture straight out of the shower with a few drops of 111Skin's Rose Gold Radiance Booster mixed into Dr. Barbara Sturm's Super Anti-Aging Body Serum – a beautifully hydrating formula that feels nearly invisible on skin. For extra shine, add the luminizing drops to a body oil – such as Augustinus Bader's velvety formula – instead. Then finish with a full-watt effect by running Hourglass's Vanish Flash Highlighting Stick in Champagne Flash – a luminous gold – or Westman Atelier's Lit Up Highlight Stick in Nectar – a radiant golden-peach – along your shins, collarbones and shoulders before hitting the beach bar. Super-boost your blush If you're sunburnt, you may want to sit this one out, but otherwise, amplify that healthy vacation flush while it lasts with a hit of blusher. Our tip? Opt for warm tones over cool: coral, rosy pink, peach or terracotta work at different intensities across all skin tones. Westman Atelier's Blush Stick in Minette is the perfect suits-all coral, with its melt-in formula for easy reapplication – well worth popping into your clutch for the night. For something punchier, try Clé de Peau Beauté's Cream Blush in Pale Fig, a vivid rose, that truly brings out the warmth in freshly tanned skin. Powder formulas work just as well when layered into skin. We love Hermès Beauty's Rose Hermès Silky Blush Powder in Rose Tan, a golden pink. Press the cream formula onto your complexion straight from the stick or dab the powder with a damp makeup sponge first and take it across cheeks, temples, eyelids and the bridge of your nose to mimic a natural sun flush, before swiping across your lips and adding a balm.

mov_52276F25665F5FCD35E6D51CF1E091B0,"  Launch date: July 10 It's time to get juicy this summer with Charlotte Tilbury's new Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oils. These new tinted lip oils feel like a lip gloss and oil hybrid. They're slick, high-shine and somehow not sticky at all, which makes them ideal for those who don't typically like a lip gloss, but want gleaming, shiny lips. The new lip oil comes in six ""juicylicious"" colors: Pink Watermelon, Strawberry Vanilla, Coconut Water, Cherry Glaze, Pure Peach and Candy Fig. As the names suggest, each oil smells just like its matching fruit essence. Packed with moisturizing hyaluronic acid microspheres and vitamin E, these new Nectar Oils don't just look good on, they also work to plump and hydrate your pout. I got my hands on two shades ahead of the launch (Cherry Glaze and Pure Peach) and can't seem to put them down. Since they have an oil-based formula, they glide on and stay put without that sticky feeling. The colors are subtle and buildable, and the easy-glide gel applicator makes swiping them on a breeze. If you loved the iconic Juicy Tubes from the past, you're sure to be obsessed with these.","Launch date: July 10 It's time to get juicy this summer with Charlotte Tilbury's new Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oils.

mov_03AE4146A9F3B52104779D145BC751B8,"  Ruth Langsford has been sharing her must-have skincare products to social media and one item that she loves to use on repeat is these Jelly Eye Patches from Nip+Fab. Formulated to plump and rehydrate under-eyes, the patches work to revive tired, puffy skin in just 15 minutes, and they're great to use before a special event. Currently on offer at Amazon, a box of 20 pairs is now reduced to £15.96 from £19.95. The Nip+Fab Jelly Patches are formulated with hyaluronic acid to hydrate skin and reduce dryness instantly, tremella (also known as snow mushroom) to tackle fine lines and wrinkles, and polyglutamic acid which holds four times more water than hyaluronic acid. Elsewhere on Charlotte Tilbury, the Hollywood Skin Secrets Immediate Eye Revival Patches, £58, are packed with Bio-Smooth Eye Contour Complex to depuff and hydrate under-eyes in 10 minutes. ESPA Isotonic Hydra Gel Eye Masks are formulated with minerals, antioxidants and natural extracts that help plump, brighten, and soothe tired eyes. Shoppers can get them at Next, where they cost £36.50. Ruth explained that the jelly patches made her fall in love with Nip+Fab and she has even partnered with the brand to test out other products. In a recent post on Instagram, she said: ""I just want to talk to you about this Nip+Fab, I was introduced to this brand by my make-up artist who's using this on me. It's lovely, hydrating jelly eye patches that you might have seen me, on Instagram, the bright green ones under my eyes."" The jelly patches have also gained approval from shoppers on Amazon, earning them an overall 4.4 out of five average star-rating. One said: ""I have super sensitive eyes and wear contact lenses and these don't cause any irritation or stinging, even if very close to the waterline."" A second shared her tip: ""I pop these right at the back of my fridge so they are extra cold, once on they stay cold for at least 20 plus minutes they are also thick but not too thick unlike others I've used are really thin and slip off, my eyes feel refreshed after using these."" However, one questioned the efficacy of the patches and penned: ""Still early days they seem to leave my under eye feeling smooth, however I could only really lie down when applied as they just slide down your face, which if you're busy and multi-tasking, it isn't great."" Another said the masks aren't 'particularly hydrating' and 'slide significantly'. But someone else added: ""Love these eye patches. Really hydrating for under eye skin and smoothes out those fine lines."" READ NEXT","Ruth Langsford has been sharing her must-have skincare products to social media and one item that she loves to use on repeat is these Jelly Eye Patches from Nip+Fab. Formulated to plump and rehydrate under-eyes, the patches work to revive tired, puffy skin in just 15 minutes, and they're great to use before a special event. Currently on offer at Amazon, a box of 20 pairs is now reduced to £15.96 from £19.95. The Nip+Fab Jelly Patches are formulated with hyaluronic acid to hydrate skin and reduce dryness instantly, tremella (also known as snow mushroom) to tackle fine lines and wrinkles, and polyglutamic acid which holds four times more water than hyaluronic acid. Elsewhere on Charlotte Tilbury, the Hollywood Skin Secrets Immediate Eye Revival Patches, £58, are packed with Bio-Smooth Eye Contour Complex to depuff and hydrate under-eyes in 10 minutes. ESPA Isotonic Hydra Gel Eye Masks are formulated with minerals, antioxidants and natural extracts that help plump, brighten, and soothe tired eyes. Shoppers can get them at Next, where they cost £36.50. Ruth explained that the jelly patches made her fall in love with Nip+Fab and she has even partnered with the brand to test out other products. In a recent post on Instagram, she said: ""I just want to talk to you about this Nip+Fab, I was introduced to this brand by my make-up artist who's using this on me. It's lovely, hydrating jelly eye patches that you might have seen me, on Instagram, the bright green ones under my eyes.""

1m2c1j1,"  No matter whether I use primer or not, moisturize or not, use a powder concealer or cream concealer, set with powder or not, use a little or cake it on, use a brush or blender; my nose is always nice & even for about two hours before it separates and looks like that :( I've used Makeup Forever, Charlotte Tilbury, Estée Lauder, Tarte & KIKO Milano's concealers. As for powders, I've used Laura Mercier, Flower Knows and a Korean brand called seven7een. I've tried Too Faced's primer & Charlotte Tilbury's. I gave Elf's power grip a try but I couldn't keep it on long enough to see if it had a significant effect, it felt horrible on my face and I couldn't keep it on, felt suffocated, gave it away. I've seen people recommend LA girl's pro concealer but I can't get that here and Amazon's delivery fees are crazy so I don't want to get it if I'm not sure it'll work for me. Honestly the only thing I've noticed making a significant difference is Flower Knows' powder but that still doesn't prevent the separation. I've also tried putting on some Vaseline before putting the concealer on and it helps a bit but again, it's so heavy on the face.

mov_C6BC05C5A05E2D13A12D7E58D6B4C2E5,"  Now I have so much more room in my suitcase. As a travel editor, I'm always eagerly trying to plan my next trip so I can test new gear and debunk viral hacks. The biggest packing lesson I've learned in my decade of travel? Never underestimate your toiletry bag. This became abundantly clear on my last trip to London, when my poorly packed toiletry bag single-handedly ruined my experience abroad. I'd foolishly stuffed and stashed as many toiletries, skincare jars, and makeup products as I could into my small bag, which subsequently ripped mid-way through the trip from the constant tugging, squishing, and pushing it endured with every use. In addition to leaky toiletries and hogging precious luggage space, the overstuffed toiletry bag also got me flagged on my return flight to New York. Since it exceeded England's liquid carry-on limit, I had to exit the security line and toss $200 worth of beloved products from Charlotte Tilbury, Armani Beauty, and other pricey brands, resulting in a mad dash through the security line and the airport to make it to my gate. Now, you won't catch me holding up TSA or wrestling with a toiletry bag that's bursting at the seams, and it's all thanks to these genius packing tips. Keep scrolling to find out which products you need to hack your toiletry bag. Related: I'm a Pro Packer, and I Still Use These 12 Old-school Tricks to Fit Everything in a Carry-on Best Toiletry Bag Travel Essentials Hack: Upgrade your toiletry bag These tips are useless if you don't have the proper toiletry bag. When I went abroad, I was toting around a bulky pouch with no pockets or organizational features that quickly took up room in my carry-on. Now, I travel with the Béis Dopp Kit, which includes a space-doubling zippered compartment and plenty of thoughtful slip pockets to keep everything organized and compactly stored. Over at Amazon, travelers have a great deal of toiletry bags and Dopp kits to choose from. If you're prone to overpacking, I recommend starting with the Eachy toiletry bag, while the Bagsmart Dopp Kit is great for weekend trips and long vacations that require shampoo, conditioner, and other toiletries. Recently, I learned that compression packing cubes also make suitable toiletry bags. Try the smallest compression cube from Bagail's top-rated set; you can suck the air out of it to free up extra space in your personal item or carry-on. Hack: Put everything in a travel bottle Even if your go-to toiletry or skincare product comes in a tiny package, you still want to transfer it to a travel bottle. This way, you're only bringing what you need and definitely staying within the carry-on liquid requirements. Plus, they're made for travel, so you don't have to worry about anything leaking, breaking, or awkwardly fitting in your toiletry bag. Over at Amazon, you can score all-in-one value sets, like the MrsDry eight-pack set and Morfone 16-piece set that comes with travel-sized jars for lotion, moisturizer, and hair creams, or the 18-piece Tocelffe set that includes tiny jars for liquid foundation, concealer, and more if you're tight on space. Whenever I go on a weekend trip, I use my Depoza travel bottle set, which I love for the travel-sized sprayer that fits my Rôz Air Thickening Leave-in Spray and other hair care essentials inside its compact clear bag. Hack: Stock up on travel-sized products When transferring your toiletries and beauty products into travel bottles isn't an option, you'll want to make sure that you've got them ready to go in TSA-approved, travel-sized containers. Luckily, almost every product comes in a travel-friendly mini version (which is great if you've been wanting to try a product but don't want to pay full price). At the top of my travel-sized must-haves is the Ilia Base Face Milk, which adds extra hydration to your skin when you're on the go (whether you're doing your nighttime routine after a long day in the sun or need to get rid of dryness before putting on your makeup). Speaking of hydration, the Epicuren Papaya Pineapple After Bath Body Lotion is another toiletry non-negotiable that happens to be a celeb-loved product (Kim Kardashian is a longtime fan); it hardly takes up any space in your toiletry bag, and it performs way better than the hotel-provided hand and body lotion. Don't forget about the makeup minis: I always keep a tiny bottle of Charlotte Tilbury's Hollywood Flawless Filter in my toiletry bag because, when it's on, I don't need foundation (thus simplifying my packing list). Another pro tip: palettes are your best friends, especially when they come in travel sizes. The Natasha Denona Mini Bronze + Glow palette is like packing three makeup products in one; it covers bronzer, highlight, and eyeshadow if you put a little bit of both products on your eyes. Hack: Utilize your pill organizer Nothing fills up a toiletry bag faster than pill bottles. I usually travel with probiotics, melatonin gummies, and my daily medications—plus Ibuprofen, Benadryl, Dramamine, Pepcid, and other important ""just in case "" medications depending on where I'm traveling. Instead of jamming multiple bottles and jars into my toiletry bag, I opt for the Holli pill organizer for small trips and the Bexeen pill organizer for longer ones (it has eight compartments that are perfect for everything I'd need). Those with routines to follow will want to check out the slim, weekly pill organizer from Vaydeer, and the Fyy Daily Pill Organizer is also great for organizing multiple medicine shapes, sizes, and quantities without taking up too much space. Pro tip: Use the unused compartments in your pill organizer for tiny things like jewelry, Q-tips, cotton rounds, nail clippers, and more, so you don't need another travel case for them. Hack: Downsize your tools Your skincare routine isn't the only part of your packing list that should be downsized. For extra space, I've learned that traveling with mini versions of my go-to tools can help free clutter from my toiletry bag. For example, I always had the tendency to bring my full-sized brush with me on every trip. Now, I bring the mini Emi Jay Boar Bristle Hair Brush (it's compact enough to fit in a toiletry bag or in your carry-on's unsuspecting pockets if you don't have the toiletry bag space). The same goes for my toothbrush; instead of being weighed down by my bulky electric toothbrush and its charging base, I bring the Philips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush that runs on batteries and comes with a small travel case. You can also save space by bringing a mini hair straightener instead of a full-size version. Hack: Simplify your routine The most effective way I've found to stop overpacking my toiletry bag is to simplify my getting-ready routine. This is not easy, especially if you're someone who likes to have a specific product for everything. To ensure that there are no holes in your travel routine, opt for products that multitask. For example, the IT Cosmetics CC+ Cream covers your sunscreen and foundation, so you don't need to pack a separate SPF and coverup. Similarly, you can reduce the products in your hair care routine by packing the R+Co Cool Wind Air Dry Hair Cream, which doubles as a leave-in conditioner and a styling product (you don't even need a hair dryer!)...","Now I have so much more room in my suitcase. As a travel editor, I'm always eagerly trying to plan my next trip so I can test new gear and debunk viral hacks. The biggest packing lesson I've learned in my decade of travel? Never underestimate your toiletry bag. This became abundantly clear on my last trip to London, when my poorly packed toiletry bag single-handedly ruined my experience abroad. I'd foolishly stuffed and stashed as many toiletries, skincare jars, and makeup products as I could into my small bag, which subsequently ripped mid-way through the trip from the constant tugging, squishing, and pushing it endured with every use. In addition to leaky toiletries and hogging precious luggage space, the overstuffed toiletry bag also got me flagged on my return flight to New York. Since it exceeded England's liquid carry-on limit, I had to exit the security line and toss $200 worth of beloved products from Charlotte Tilbury, Armani Beauty, and other pricey brands, resulting in a mad dash through the security line and the airport to make it to my gate. Now, you won't catch me holding up TSA or wrestling with a toiletry bag that's bursting at the seams, and it's all thanks to these genius packing tips. Keep scrolling to find out which products you need to hack your toiletry bag.

When I went abroad, I was toting around a bulky pouch with no pockets or organizational features that quickly took up room in my carry-on. Now, I travel with the Béis Dopp Kit, which includes a space-doubling zippered compartment and plenty of thoughtful slip pockets to keep everything organized and compactly stored. Over at Amazon, travelers have a great deal of toiletry bags and Dopp kits to choose from. If you're prone to overpacking, I recommend starting with the Eachy toiletry bag, while the Bagsmart Dopp Kit is great for weekend trips and long vacations that require shampoo, conditioner, and other toiletries. Recently, I learned that compression packing cubes also make suitable toiletry bags. Try the smallest compression cube from Bagail's top-rated set; you can suck the air out of it to free up extra space in your personal item or carry-on. Hack: Put everything in a travel bottle Even if your go-to toiletry or skincare product comes in a tiny package, you still want to transfer it to a travel bottle. This way, you're only bringing what you need and definitely staying within the carry-on liquid requirements. Plus, they're made for travel, so you don't have to worry about anything leaking, breaking, or awkwardly fitting in your toiletry bag. Over at Amazon, you can score all-in-one value sets, like the MrsDry eight-pack set and Morfone 16-piece set that comes with travel-sized jars for lotion, moisturizer, and hair creams, or the 18-piece Tocelffe set that includes tiny jars for liquid foundation, concealer, and more if you're tight on space. Whenever I go on a weekend trip, I use my Depoza travel bottle set, which I love for the travel-sized sprayer that fits my Rôz Air Thickening Leave-in Spray and other hair care essentials inside its compact clear bag.
