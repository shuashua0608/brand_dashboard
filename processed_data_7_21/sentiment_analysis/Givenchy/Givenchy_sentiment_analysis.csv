mov_D0B92F8FAF1CDDEFA7165705DDD75DB3,"  Princess Charlotte made her third Wimbledon appearance this weekend, alongside Prince William and Princess Kate. Her outfit especially stood out: a white frilled dress with black piping, which subtly matched a look worn by her mother in 2022. But this was not just a case of twinning; the outfit was a carefully styled nod to Kate's past wardrobe, her designer relationships, and even Charlotte's own personality. From the bespoke dress to her silver charm bracelet, nearly every detail of Charlotte's ensemble carried a deeper reference or sentimental value. Custom dress with Royal history Charlotte's white summer dress was custom-made by Sarah Burton, the designer responsible for Kate's 2011 wedding gown. It featured soft frill detailing at the hem and precise black V-line stitching. These are design elements closely resembling a certain white Emilia Wickstead dress Kate wore at the Guards Polo Club in 2022. Burton, now at Givenchy, also dressed Kate in a dark red gown at a State Banquet earlier this month. Her recent involvement with both royals hints at a growing fashion mentorship between Kate and her daughter. For footwear and accessories, Charlotte wore Camilla Elphick flats and Finlay & Co sunglasses, another overlap with Kate's past Wimbledon appearances. Charm bracelet with personal touches Charlotte's silver Pandora bracelet added more clues. One charm was set with a green stone—her May birthstone—while another was a miniature Nala from The Lion King, possibly referencing her known love for animated films. The third charm was a silver heart paired with an engraved disk. Though the inscription wasn't readable, it appeared to be custom-made. The disk likely contains a message from or about someone close to her, given that Pandora's official listings state that the charm is meant for a “personal stamp” or “message for someone special.” ALSO READ: IN PICS: Preity Zinta and Gene Goodenough enjoy Wimbledon date, Sara Tendulkar has a fun day with family","Princess Charlotte made her third Wimbledon appearance this weekend, alongside Prince William and Princess Kate.

Antes dela, Julia Michaels deu o pontapé inicial no evento com um repertório que incluiu “Issues”, “Pink”, o novo single “Jump” e covers de grandes hits que ela mesma escreveu para outros artistas. ⠀ ⠀Entre os rostos famosos que prestigiaram o show estavam Ashley Tisdale e a influencer Camila Coelho. E pra quem ama moda, um detalhe irresistível: Kelsea usava uma blusa Rosa Chá, Ariana apostou em calças da [club220787517|Moonlight], um top com brilho da [club162309073|Givenchy] e finalizou o look com botas [club218217683|Christian Louboutin]. ⠀ ⠀Uma noite de talento, emoção e muito estilo — daquelas que ficam marcadas na memória (e na timeline)!

44DF2738300840B12C56DCAB4CD23D30,"  Appearances at Wimbledon and a French state visit symbolize a new kind of style. Earlier this year, when Catherine, the Princess of Wales, returned to the public eye after her treatment for cancer, The Sunday Times of London reported that she was doing so with a caveat: She wanted to focus on her work, not her clothes. Her office would no longer share information about what she wore. Cue shock and horror. Even if it was understandable, given what she had been through, and even if the report was later disputed by the palace itself, it sent tremors through the fashion-watching community. That was partly because the princess could change the fortunes of a designer or a brand simply by wearing a dress. And it was partly because she had long used her place in the attention economy to shine a light not just on British products, but on issues like sustainability by remaking and rewearing pieces from her closet, and even renting the occasional evening gown. Mostly, though, it was because the clothes are an expression of her role as a symbol -- of the country and that fine line between continuity and modernization. Stepping back from one suggested she was stepping back from the other. It's a weird thing to essentially be an avatar, but it's the job. As her appearance at the Wimbledon men's and women's finals, and at the French state visit, demonstrated, however, Catherine may be more selective about her appearances (she did skip Ascot), but she is no less strategic. She is simply being Catherine 3.0. There she was, after all, at the state visit, welcoming Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron in a blush-colored Dior suit with a New Look jacket and a skirt covered in net, just brushing her calves. The brand is both classic French and about to be led by a designer from Northern Ireland who was trained in Britain. It was a considered nod to political alliance (the kind she has practiced since marrying Prince William) that she repeated at the French state banquet, wearing a red Givenchy gown with a built-in cape sweeping down from her shoulders. It was regal, sure, but also strategic, given that Givenchy is now designed by Sarah Burton, the British designer who made Catherine's wedding gown and who has been her collaborator on numerous high-profile public occasions. Talk about entente. And there Catherine was at the Wimbledon women's final in a cream jacket and long pleated skirt, a coolly appropriate riff on tennis whites and her position as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club. So, too, the royal blue ankle-length Roksanda dress she wore to the men's final was perfectly coordinated with Prince William's blue blazer, Prince George's blue suit and Princess Charlotte's white dress trimmed in blue, all creating a literal picture of family unity. All demonstrating that Catherine is as attuned as ever to the role image-making plays in her job. That's not new. What is new, however, is the style in which she is doing it, and its consistency. Her skirts have gotten longer, her jackets more tailored, her silhouette more streamlined. The effect of dropping her hemlines even a few inches is both oddly nostalgic and sophisticated, gently protective. A reminder that she is dressing for the long game. Like the lanky pantsuits she had adopted for her everyday appearances, her style is shaping up as a new formula for dressing. As recognizable, in its own way, as the monochrome formula that served Queen Elizabeth II so well: shoes-to-coat-to-dress-to-hat in one shade. And it brings a new dimension to the symbolism inherent in Catherine's role. She is representing not just the next generation of the royal family, which itself represents tradition. She is representing the idea of elegance emerging from adversity, an idea that has both micro and macro associations. Who couldn't use some of that right about now?","Appearances at Wimbledon and a French state visit symbolize a new kind of style.

mov_BD15E6AF2E178969D175ED8CC1B4640F,"  KENT, OH. - The Kent State University Museum presents its summer exhibition titled Sparkle: The Style and Jewelry of Aileen Mehle. In honor of the Kent State University Museums 40th anniversary, this exhibition pays tribute to Aileen Mehle, a friend of the museum founders and widely syndicated society columnist. The exhibition features evening dresses and jewelry from Mehle that is being displayed in the museums historic Higbee Gallery from July 18, 2025, through Aug. 23, 2026. Aileen Mehle had so much taste and enthusiasm that it is fitting to pay tribute to her as we celebrate 40 years of the Kent State University Museum, stated Kent State University Museum Curator Sara Hume, Ph.D. Her career as a journalist attests to her brilliant wit and driving work ethic, yet she took extraordinary care in presenting herself appropriately for the variety of social occasions she reported on. She is an underappreciated style icon who is finally getting her due. Mehle, who lived from 1918 to 2016, wrote under the pseudonym Suzy Knickerbocker and enjoyed a career spanning five decades from the 1950s until her final column in 2005, which she wrote at the age of 87. This exhibition celebrates the sparkle of her style and the sparkle of her wit, Hume said. Mehle dressed in Pauline Trigère, Oscar de la Renta, Geoffrey Beene, Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy while wearing jewelry by David Webb, Cartier and Tiffany & Co. as well as bags by Judith Leiber and Bulgari. The exhibition features nearly two dozen vintage David Webb pieces. Aileen Mehle was the consummate David Webb collector: a self-assured woman of style who purchased countless treasures for herself and gave bejeweled gifts to her friends, noted Levi Higgs, David Webbs head of archives and brand heritage. Her records tell the story of a gregarious woman-about-town with impeccable taste and who embodied a bold and courageous sense of self-expression. Aileen Mehle was known for accessorizing her glamorous evening looks with dazzling statement jewelry, said Kent State University Museum Collections Manager/Registrar Joanne Fenn, who co-curated the exhibition with Hume. We are thrilled to debut her exceptional collection featuring work from influential jewelry designers such as Jean Schlumberger, Paloma Picasso, Bulgari and more. This exhibition promises to both inspire and engage students, offering a rare glimpse into the artistry and craftsmanship of these iconic creators. In an era before everyone could turn to social media to discover who was going where or who was seeing whom, Suzy, as Aileen Mehle was known to her devoted fans, kept us all abreast of the comings and goings as well as the juicy scandals of New Yorks social set, said Armand Limnander, executive editor of W. Her dazzling jewelry and clothing collection is testament to the time in which she lived and the world she inhabited. Among the approximately 20 dresses from the 1960s through the 1990s mounted in the exhibition is the beaded dress by Nilo de Paul that she wore to Truman Capotes Black and White Ball in 1966 alongside a selection of her jewelry that range from vintage earrings from the 1930s to statement necklaces and bracelets from the 1980s. Aileen aka Suzy moved in rarefied circles, or should I say, rarefied circles moved around Aileen. She was, in the years she wrote for WWD, almost always bedecked in frills and froth, sometimes with a boa wrapped around her, said James Fallon, chief content officer of Fairchild Media Group and WWD. But those soft outfits covered a steely reporter whose eyes never missed anything and whose ears heard every whisper of affairs, scandals and the latest social gossip. She was repeatedly asked to write a tell-all book about her life but would always respond that she knew too many secrets to tell them all. It is a cliché to say someone is one of a kind, but in Aileens case, there is no better description. This exhibition reflects the spirit of our 40th anniversary season honoring our history, showcasing our extraordinary collection and articulating a bold and engaging vision for our future, said Kent State University Museum Director Sarah Spinner Liska, Ph.D., J.D. The Sparkle: The Style and Jewelry of Aileen Mehle exhibition includes a specially designed installation an imagined, custom-built closet showcasing Mehles garments, offering an intimate and engaging glimpse into her iconic style.","KENT, OH. - The Kent State University Museum presents its summer exhibition titled Sparkle: The Style and Jewelry of Aileen Mehle.
