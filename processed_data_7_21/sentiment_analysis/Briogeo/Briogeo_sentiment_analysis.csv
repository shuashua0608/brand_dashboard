n43xjm5,"  And I feel the opposite, haha! I was hoping to see some great skincare, in addition to some nice foundations (and *some* makeup - but I am more of a skincare girlie, lol). For me, I think that the RMS concealer might be okay/nice to try - assuming they offer the shade I need (000 or 00, based on their website - I'm Casper, lol) and maybe the Makeup by Mario highlighter might be okay, too (if it's not super flashy, as they describe it), when it comes to makeup... as I have way too many mascaras, eyeshadow palettes (especially the same colour story), eyeliners, and clear brow gel (plus I just got that same brow gel in my July GB). Never mind that they don't seem all that ""luxe"" to me. When it comes to hair and skincare, the Kopari, Odacité, Amika, Briogeo, & Saturday Skin products aren't too bad - but again, they're not giving ""luxury"" or *Icon Box* to me... idk what I'm hoping for, I guess... I mean, I don't think I'd be ***MAD*** if I got a few of the spoiled items that I have my eye on and some other nice (luxe) products, as well as other ones that follow my preferences and whose price-points actually fit an Icon Box. Hbu? Would you be happy with a box that had a few of these makeup products as well as others that fit your preferences and that are suitable from an Icon Box? With all of their constant price increases that they claim are going to help them give us better quality, better products, etc.. , we should be getting the highest-end, most awesome boxes yet, at this point!!!","And I feel the opposite, haha!
