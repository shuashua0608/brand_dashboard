The surprise album dropped on Friday, July 11, and features 21 songs. 'SWAG' quickly raced to #1 on Spotify and Apple's music charts. Several reports suggest it could secure 150,000 to 175,000 album equivalent units during its debut week. Morgan Wallen's 'I'm the Problem' dominates America's album chart. It has been at No.1 on the Billboard 200 for two months! Two songs on the album, 'Daisies' and 'All I Can Take', are also set for a big first week. 'Daisies' scored #1 on Spotify's U.S. and Global Song Debut charts while 'All I Can Take' claimed the #1 spot on Apple Music Song Debut charts. Several songs from the album will likely make it onto the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart, but it remains to be seen which one will top the chart. Alex Warren's 'Ordinary' is currently at #1. According to Chart Data, 'SWAG' recorded over 95-million streams on Spotify on its first day of release.

1m05fj8,"  **Note: I have already posted this in another makeup subreddit but barely got any advice. I'm hoping posting it here may help… I turn red in the face and I'm struggling to cover it up properly and effectively. So, for some context as to how this began: I started a medication last Christmas and with every medication comes their side effects as most would know. I didn't know that my medication would stop me from sweating as it was always cold in the house because it was winter, but once it started getting warmer, my face would turn red often even from the littlest bit of warmth. And I know some might say that's normal and unavoidable, but I've never had it happen as often and as severe as this. In previous years, including last year, my cheeks were the only part on my face that would frequently turn red from warmth. Nowadays, my medication causes my face to turn red when I'm even just a little bit too warm. The only way to help battle the redness without makeup (and also because I'm literally too overheated to function) is to cool myself down with air conditioning because nothing else helps. The reason I'm making this post is because I have been struggling with makeup lately to help cover up my redness (oftentimes before it happens), especially when I'm leaving the house. I've never turned this red before, and even if I did, it was usually only on my cheeks, not my entire face like it is nowadays thanks to the medication… I have dry and sensitive skin, and not a lot of products have worked for me, but for a couple months now, I have been using Jason Wu's Tinted Moisturizer Meets CC Cream and it's been the best base makeup product I've used in years! I've also switched from putting the green shade from the NYX Color Corrector palette all over my face (exhausting because it takes forever to work into the skin) to recently using Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (because I use their normal Age Rewind Concealer and I've loved it since forever). I have also purchased the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer since someone I know recommended it for my situation, but I haven't tried it yet since I don't understand how it helps… And no, this post isn't just me rambling about my struggles with makeup. I'm here asking for help from those who may have experience with these products, this situation, or those who have professional makeup advice for me. There's a few issues I've been having with my makeup lately: 1. I've found that sometimes touching my face will take my tinted moisturizer right off, or if my nail presses ever so slightly onto my skin, that it'll remove the makeup in that exact area. I've tried to combat this by setting my face with the only setting powder I own, which is one from E.L.F. I just don't remember the name. I've only done this method once and it seemed to have helped but I'm unsure about how much it helped. 2. If I don't apply enough of my chosen colour corrector (remember, I still haven't tried the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer yet) underneath my tinted moisturizer, then my redness will shine through later on and it makes me feel horrible about myself (I know many people have rosacea and other skin conditions that can cause mass redness, but I'm just remaining honest on how my type of redness makes me feel, so please don't take any offence as I don't mean any…). 3. To conclude this, I'm also heavily struggling with how to make this whole process simpler and less stress-inducing because I'm oftentimes trying to cover my redness before it actually appears, so I cannot tell how much green will help combat the red. Sometimes I've used too little and later my redness peeked through my makeup, or I've used too much and I've had to put on a lot of tinted moisturizer to cover it. It was also my first time using setting powder because I was scared it would cause me to dry out because of my skin type. I just need some advice… If anyone has any questions regarding what I mentioned, then please ask. I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions from anyone who is familiar with this or knows, professionally, how to help. I'm also on a tight budget as I barely make any money nowadays, so purchasing luxury beauty products or pricy items is something I'd very much like to avoid unless there's no other way. Sorry for this jumble of stuff. I've just been so frustrated lately and I've gotten very tired of spending a lot of time looking up how to help with these things and coming up with nothing, either because the advice found didn't help or wasn't the right solution to my problem. Thank you. ***TL;DR: I've been turning red in the face from a medication I take that stops me from sweating (meaning I cannot cool myself down). I'm struggling to both cover this up and maintain my makeup without it smudging off or rubbing off by a small tap to the face.","**Note: I have already posted this in another makeup subreddit but barely got any advice.

It sent SPF into the middle of the Pacific and trusted the story would take care of itself. That act of unprompted generosity – and restraint – made the response feel genuine. It wasn't influencer content; it was content that happened to feature an influencer. Ceding control to creators emerges as an important factor when building emotional connections on social platforms. Three out of five consumers say they are more likely to recommend a brand to others, purchase a product from that brand, or explore other products by that brand when a favoured creator endorses them, according to Deloitte's The Creator Economy in 3D research. Creators also expect and demand control, and brands are more likely to get to work with the best talent if they take this approach. ' One of the core tenets of creator marketing is co-creation, whereby you match them up, you give them the brief, and then they go away, and they produce what they think is relevant and will work on their channel,'  explains Ed East, co-founder of independent influencer agency Billion Dollar Boy, in our How to Work with Influencers & Creators feature.

It sent SPF into the middle of the Pacific and trusted the story would take care of itself. That act of unprompted generosity – and restraint – made the response feel genuine. It wasn't influencer content; it was content that happened to feature an influencer. Ceding control to creators emerges as an important factor when building emotional connections on social platforms. Three out of five consumers say they are more likely to recommend a brand to others, purchase a product from that brand, or explore other products by that brand when a favoured creator endorses them, according to Deloitte's The Creator Economy in 3D research. Creators also expect and demand control, and brands are more likely to get to work with the best talent if they take this approach. ' One of the core tenets of creator marketing is co-creation, whereby you match them up, you give them the brief, and then they go away, and they produce what they think is relevant and will work on their channel,' explains Ed East, co-founder of independent influencer agency Billion Dollar Boy, in our How to Work with Influencers & Creators feature.

mov_73E4ED1F1427B944611E55FC53EC0880,"  The beauty and personal care landscape continues to grow increasingly competitive in the advent of increased social selling, pushing industry stakeholders to pivot into increasingly creative, innovative efforts to reinvent category offerings. According to the recently released the new report by consumer insight firm NIQ, these efforts are paying dividends: e-commerce drove a 17.4% increase in beauty and health sales in 2024, with online now representing 42% of total category revenue. E-commerce, social selling, and the largest swing in category growth Among the trends tracked in NIQ's report, social media, wellness, personalization, and luxury, social media was highlighted as the most transformative force. “It's not just about visibility; TikTok is becoming a commerce channel itself,” said Anna Mayo, Vice President, Beauty Vertical at NIQ. Through “social selling (especially on TikTok Shop), rapid digital discovery, and retail consolidation around platforms like Amazon,” she told CosmeticsDesign USA, the beauty category has particularly benefited from the growing influence of impulse-driven purchases. As noted in NIQ's report, 68% of social buys are unplanned, with user-generated content as a main driver behind the conversion momentum. Leading beauty brands in this space, Mayo advised, are leveraging building blocks like “experiential digital storytelling, social-first product launches and agile fulfillment across platforms.” For example, brands such as e.l.f., Phlur, and Dove are developing launch strategies specifically tailored for social platforms. “This forces manufacturers to prioritize agility, trend responsiveness, and creator partnerships in product development and marketing,” she said. High-growth segments signal new consumer priorities The fragrance category was a notable outlier, according to the report, with a 20% year-over-year growth rate that was largely driven by viral trends and evolving consumer behavior, especially among Gen Z. For example, Mayo illustrated, “instead of having a signature scent, they are investing in a fragrance wardrobe, with scents for different moods and occasions, that can also be layered together.” Brands that are attuned to the demographic and behavioral shifts like this have responded by expanding hero fragrances into new product formats, such as body care, and intensifying social media campaigns. “With fragrance's emotional and identity-driven appeal, as well as its continued innovation in formats and storytelling, the category is well-positioned for continued growth,” she added. Several other emerging and previously underperforming segments also outpaced expectations in 2024. “Categories like first aid, lip care, and men's body care stood out with high-growth product launches,” she said. Products like Dr. Squatch lip balm and Band-Aid Pro Heal Bandages, for example, reflected a growing demand for “wellness-adjacent personal care” and innovation in functional and inclusive product design. Strategic innovation imperative for 2025 and beyond The impact of brand innovation, which the report noted contributed to nine percent of mass retail beauty sales, cannot be understated, said Mayo. Citing examples like Sol de Janeiro's Rio Deo and SheaMoisture's Even Tone Deodorant as evidence that consumers respond positively to new offerings from trusted brands, the data demonstrated that line extensions have been a successful endeavor for some beauty brands over the past year. “These cases show that consumers gravitate toward familiar, trusted brands offering new formats that match their values, whether that's wellness, inclusivity or luxury feel at mass price points,” she explained. However, she cautioned, while innovation is “a critical driver of brand growth, especially in times of economic uncertainty...the data shows that while line extensions dominate, not all innovation leads to incremental growth, so brands must be diligent in assessing whether new products are additive or potentially cannibalizing existing sales.” Ultimately, she concluded, “success will depend on staying agile, insight-driven, and culturally relevant, developing products that not only meet functional needs but also tap into emerging values and behaviors shaping the future of health and beauty.”","The beauty and personal care landscape continues to grow increasingly competitive in the advent of increased social selling, pushing industry stakeholders to pivot into increasingly creative, innovative efforts to reinvent category offerings.

An EOS Cashmere Body Oil so silky and glow-inducing, your skin will literally look like it hopped off at hydration station. This lightweight formula melts in like butter (minus the grease), locks in moisture for 24 hours, and leaves behind a subtle yet delectable scent of ""Vanilla Cashmere."" Oh — and plot twist? That's the same scent as the internet-famous EOS lotion everyone's obsessed with. Promising review: ""I love the scent of this body oil, it wasn't too oily, it made my skin softer, it wasn't greasy at all and it's an excellent value for the money. I will definitely be buying more in the near future."" —Delina Flowers Price: $12.99 2. A dainty pair of bow earrings that'll have people asking ""OMG, where'd you get those?"" every time you wear them. Available in gold and silver, these cuties are the perfect mix of trendy and timeless — and they're under $15... a steal, IMO. Promising review: ""Obsessed!! These earrings are so stinkin' cute! They are the perfect size — not too big, but not too small, either. For my ears they didn't feel heavy to wear all day. I just love them!!"" —Danielle Sharp Furlow Price: $12.99 (available in three styles) 3. A pair of retro-inspired oval sunglasses if you want to wear a signature Miu Miu sunglass style without paying designer prices. These petite, trendy frames are giving ""celebrity in hiding"" energy, complete with UV protection and a lightweight feel. You may catch yourself wearing these at any chance you get when it's sunny out (you've been warned). Promising review: ""I bought these sunglasses because they're very trendy right now, but I didn't want to dish out an exorbitant amount of money because the frame isn't my usual.

It's rechargeable, lightweight, and has different speed settings so you can control your personal chill zone as you're commuting, walking the dog, or just trying to survive summer. Promising review: ""This arrived quickly, love the color, had NO chemical or new plastic fumes, already had a bit of a charge to test it before charging it fully. I must say both [my husband and I] are impressed with the amount of power it has on all [three] settings.

E.l.f.'s Lash Xtndr Tubing Mascara hugs each lash to create volume and extends length with a unique technology that our readers and editors alike can't stop raving about. Enriched with jojoba seed oil, this conditions as the applicator separates and lengthens each lash. What you're left with? A long-lasting, dramatic, eye-opening finish. Watch on TikTok as one user goes from skeptic to believer! BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord considers herself a fan: ""I am not a new human to the tubing mascara game, and in fact, I readily spent $26 on the famous OG blend from Blinc every time it needed replacing. I didn't even love it for the length half as much as the fact that tubing mascara like this genuinely never smudges, but can I just say — regardless of price, the E.l.f. tubing mascara formula blows all the others I've tried out of the water. It gives me way more length and volume than other brands, slides on so much more easily, stays put ALL day, and never, ever smudges. My favorite part, though, is how gently and easily it comes off with soap and water. In the past, other mascara removals have felt rough on my lashes, but this comes off so fast that I'm like ??? was I even wearing mascara a minute ago?? Anyway, I hesitate even writing this review because I want to gatekeep the hell out of this before it sells out, but the world needed to know.

Yep, this holy grail sculpts lashes at only $5 a tube, which, if you think about it, is less than a fancy coffee order! And this is cruelty free! See it in action on TikTok. BuzzFeed Shopping editor Kayla Boyd tried this out and raves: ""As someone who isn't a big fan of false lashes (the glue irritates my eyes, and I'm terrible at applying them), this budget-friendly holy grail does the trick for both lengthening and volumizing my lashes. After you've given it a minute to dry, it lasts all day long and doesn't smudge or fade. It seriously gives the effect of false lashes, without the discomfort."" Promising review: ""After using Lights, Camera, Lashes by Tarte for the past year, I got tired of breaking the bank over mascara. My sister suggested Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect, and I IMMEDIATELY fell in love. It provides dramatic length and great volume. I can honestly say I can't stop looking at my eyelashes in the mirror every single day because of how awesome they look. Also, it is very long-wearing.

I thought it was a fluke when I first started using it, but it's been weeks now and stayed consistent. It looks amazing, lashes are longer, fuller, and separated — I'm so happy I tried it, and you will be too!"" —Adel Richardson Get it from Amazon for $7 (available in three shades). 2. Or Essence Lash Princess Mascara, which achieves skyscraper falsie lashes at such a gasp-worthy price, 30,000-plus reviewers haven't been able to shut up about it. Yep, this holy grail sculpts lashes at only $5 a tube, which, if you think about it, is less than a fancy coffee order! And this is cruelty free! See it in action on TikTok. BuzzFeed Shopping editor Kayla Boyd tried this out and raves: ""As someone who isn't a big fan of false lashes (the glue irritates my eyes, and I'm terrible at applying them), this budget-friendly holy grail does the trick for both lengthening and volumizing my lashes. After you've given it a minute to dry, it lasts all day long and doesn't smudge or fade. It seriously gives the effect of false lashes, without the discomfort."" Promising review: ""After using Lights, Camera, Lashes by Tarte for the past year, I got tired of breaking the bank over mascara. My sister suggested Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect, and I IMMEDIATELY fell in love. It provides dramatic length and great volume. I can honestly say I can't stop looking at my eyelashes in the mirror every single day because of how awesome they look. Also, it is very long-wearing. I go from an eight-hour workday right to the gym and sweat like wild...and this stuff doesn't budge! I love it!!"" —Carrie E Weikert Get it from Amazon for $4.74 (available also in a pack of three).

Milani Conceal + Perfect Smoothing Primer casts a magical soft-focus filter over pores and uneven texture — one that also blurs and brightens. With niacinamide and hyaluronic acid in a whipped souffle-like formula, it ensures smoother makeup application and long-lasting hydration. Promising review: ""This primer is a game changer! It blurs pores, smooths skin, and controls shine without feeling heavy. My makeup stays fresh for hours, and it works great with matte foundations. Plus, it's fragrance-free — perfect for sensitive skin!...",2025-07-16 11:30:02,en,WEB,,,,a6fdaa975ea51c9790396c28dfe4c6c0,,False,1,True,Affiliate,High,True,"The comment contains multiple detailed product reviews with direct Amazon purchase links, extensive quotes from ""editors"" and ""reviewers"", and reads like a curated product recommendation piece typical",[],False,,,

mov_0A440AE19F198C9B6A9A0EFFB4306133,"  While most of us ditch our routine in the summer, I think I've found the product that's upped my makeup game Summer is hands down one of my favourite times of the year, mainly because I can skip the makeup routine, especially when a fresh tan gives that perfect sun-kissed glow. But let's be real: for those of us who feel a bit self-conscious about our skin, a little makeup can really help boost confidence while still keeping that holiday radiance alive. As someone with dry skin, finding a primer that doesn't cling to dry patches or add extra texture has always been a struggle. After a lot of trial and error, though, I think I've finally found the one: a lightweight, reliable primer that keeps my makeup in place all day and feels like second skin. Enter the Maybelline Grippy Serum. This product has completely revamped my makeup game, and it's super affordable too. At just £10 on Amazon, the combination of its ultra-blendable formula and Serum-To-Grip technology ensures your makeup stays put for up to 24 hours. It's a water-based primer that feels fresh and lightweight but never greasy, with zero white cast, making it suitable for all skin types. Plus, I find that it hydrates and plumps the skin, which creates the perfect base for makeup. Application is a easy too: simply apply a few drops with the dropper, then gently tap it in with your fingertips or a beauty blender. Within 20 seconds, the serum transforms into a grippy texture. What I love most is that as you apply your foundation, the primer gives your skin a natural, healthy glow, leaving you with a fresh, dewy finish, perfect for those summer nights. With the addition of 2% Niacinamide, it nourishes your skin while locking your makeup in place all day long, so you won't feel like it's just melting off. It's the ideal mix of skincare and makeup in one product. For money-saving tips, sign up to our Money newsletter here Indeed, lots of people on Amazon are finding similar results, with the product securing a strong 4.3 star rating. One customer shared: ""I actually love this, goes on really well and is nice and tacky in minutes. The added benefit of skincare is just an amazing quality. Foundation sits so well on top of this and lasts all day."" However, some people have pointed out that the primer may not be suitable for all, with one person saying: ""Lovely texture for more mature skin, was really excited to try this. Until I realised all of my foundations, tinted moisturisers and cc creams were silicone based and obviously water based primer repels silicone based formulas. So the makeup separated. It clearly says it in the title that it's water based, but I didn't realise that water and silicone don't play well."" If you're also a fan of silicone-based makeup and don't want to overhaul your entire makeup collection, LookFantastic offers the perfect solution: the NYX Professional Makeup Studio Perfect Primer - Clear. Priced at £10.99, this primer helps reduce unwanted shine and control excess oils while smoothing the skin for a flawless make up finish. More along the lines of the Maybelline Grippy Serum is the e.l.f. Power Grip Primer - a must try if you believe all the TikTok hype. Like the Grippy Serum, the formula goes tacky within 30 seconds, ensuring your makeup lasts all day long. Infused with hyaluronic acid, it moisturises, preps and smooths for a plump, flawless complexion. The best part? It's currently on sale at Amazon, dropping from £10 to £7.89.","While most of us ditch our routine in the summer, I think I've found the product that's upped my makeup game Summer is hands down one of my favourite times of the year, mainly because I can skip the makeup routine, especially when a fresh tan gives that perfect sun-kissed glow. But let's be real: for those of us who feel a bit self-conscious about our skin, a little makeup can really help boost confidence while still keeping that holiday radiance alive. As someone with dry skin, finding a primer that doesn't cling to dry patches or add extra texture has always been a struggle. After a lot of trial and error, though, I think I've finally found the one: a lightweight, reliable primer that keeps my makeup in place all day and feels like second skin. Enter the Maybelline Grippy Serum. This product has completely revamped my makeup game, and it's super affordable too. At just £10 on Amazon, the combination of its ultra-blendable formula and Serum-To-Grip technology ensures your makeup stays put for up to 24 hours. It's a water-based primer that feels fresh and lightweight but never greasy, with zero white cast, making it suitable for all skin types. Plus, I find that it hydrates and plumps the skin, which creates the perfect base for makeup. Application is a easy too: simply apply a few drops with the dropper, then gently tap it in with your fingertips or a beauty blender. Within 20 seconds, the serum transforms into a grippy texture. What I love most is that as you apply your foundation, the primer gives your skin a natural, healthy glow, leaving you with a fresh, dewy finish, perfect for those summer nights. With the addition of 2% Niacinamide, it nourishes your skin while locking your makeup in place all day long, so you won't feel like it's just melting off. It's the ideal mix of skincare and makeup in one product. For money-saving tips, sign up to our Money newsletter here Indeed, lots of people on Amazon are finding similar results, with the product securing a strong 4.3 star rating. One customer shared: ""I actually love this, goes on really well and is nice and tacky in minutes. The added benefit of skincare is just an amazing quality. Foundation sits so well on top of this and lasts all day."" However, some people have pointed out that the primer may not be suitable for all, with one person saying: ""Lovely texture for more mature skin, was really excited to try this. Until I realised all of my foundations, tinted moisturisers and cc creams were silicone based and obviously water based primer repels silicone based formulas. So the makeup separated. It clearly says it in the title that it's water based, but I didn't realise that water and silicone don't play well."" If you're also a fan of silicone-based makeup and don't want to overhaul your entire makeup collection, LookFantastic offers the perfect solution: the NYX Professional Makeup Studio Perfect Primer - Clear. Priced at £10.99, this primer helps reduce unwanted shine and control excess oils while smoothing the skin for a flawless make up finish.

The all-out celebration of women's sports will include thought provoking content sessions, live podcast tapings and a can't-miss industry after party co-hosted by the iconic New York City restaurant, Sei Less. Launched in 2024, iHeart Women's Sports has already made a significant impact in the women's sports media landscape. In just one year, iHeart has raised women's sports coverage from less than one percent in 2024 to more than 34 percent in 2025, reaching 89 million monthly listeners across nearly 500 broadcast radio stations. As women's sports viewership continues to rise, iHeartMedia has remained dedicated to ensuring fair representation in media, with 50 percent of all newly produced sports podcasts focusing on women's sports coverage. In the past year, 80 percent of iHeartMedia listeners ages 18-54 have said that women's sports are becoming more accessible. iHeart Women's Sports downloads are also in the top 10 percent of all iHeartPodcast downloads, further emphasizing the demand for this type of dedicated content. “I think we can safely say that women's sports is not just having a moment but rather is on a now-undeniable trajectory that has been building for years. One year ago we launched iHeart Women's Sports knowing that fans were eager to feel more connected to their favorite players, teams and even other fans, and we are continuing to drive that progress forward,” said Jessie Katz, Head of iHeart Women's Sports. “We're excited to celebrate this incredible milestone and introduce even more shows to our roster this year.” In tandem with the one-year milestone, iHeart Women's Sports and Unanimous Media have teamed up with Azzi Fudd, one of the most electrifying talents in women's college basketball, to launch the network's newest podcast hosted by Azzi herself, “Fudd Around And Find Out.” Off the court, Fudd is a rising voice at the intersection of sports, media, business and culture. Fudd, who is currently finishing up her time at the University of Connecticut by earning her MBA, will aim to inspire listeners and provide a platform for underrepresented voices in sports. More details on “Fudd Around And Find Out” will be announced soon. Listen to the official trailer now HERE. ""I'm beyond excited to deepen my relationship with Stephen Curry and Unanimous Media as we launch 'Fudd Around And Find Out' with iHeart Women's Sports,” said Azzi Fudd. “This podcast is a space where I can bring my full self—athlete, storyteller, budding entrepreneur and fan of the game—and highlight the voices that deserve to be heard. Whether we're talking hoops, culture, business or life beyond the court, I want every episode to feel real and empowering. This has been a dream in the making and I truly can't wait for the world to… 'Fudd Around And Find Out.'” ""Azzi is a game-changer—on and off the court. We've watched her grow into not just a champion, but a powerful voice for the next generation,"" said Erick Peyton and Stephen Curry of Unanimous Media.

Many compare it to ""velcro for foundation.” * Hydrating and Dewy Finish: Thanks to ingredients like hyaluronic acid, it leaves the skin feeling plump and moisturized, and gives a natural, dewy look. This is a big plus for those who prefer a radiant finish. Elf grip goes on clear, totally translucent and will not clog your pores. * Affordable: At around $10,  five for the one I'm holding & it has lasted me 6 weeks! * Smooth Application: The gel consistency is generally easy to apply and smooths out the skin, creating a good canvas for makeup.

mov_B5C4CA08A64A76DA30900E04180D60A1,"  “These young kids are fast, but they haven't made all the mistakes, and they're not scared yet.” This savage comment from Katherine Legge underlined her attitude towards her NASCAR Cup Series debut season. The British motorsports athlete has a rich experience, having participated in endurance classics like the Rolex 24 at Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring. That is why Legge endured the 'baptism of fire' in the Cup Series with a solid approach. A possible threat looming in her path was none other than Carson Hocevar. The 22-year-old sophomore driver has already ruffled the feathers of several Cup Series veterans this year. Katherine Legge may have been another one, but the 40-year-old racer handled it like an icon. Katherine Legge shrugged at the rabble-rouser Well, given Carson Hocevar's record, this can be a difficult thing to do. Encountering the No. 77 Chevrolet up close has led to crashes for Ryan Blaney, Ross Chastain, and Ricky Stenhouse Jr this season. All of them swore to get back at the Spire Motorsports driver who was particularly nonchalant about his actions. In last Sunday's Sonoma Raceway event, Hocevar crossed paths with Katherine Legge. The latter encountered a brake issue during qualifying, so she had to start last. During the race, her No. 78 Live Fast Motorsports crew had to warn her about Hocevar flying past her. “Watch the 77 here”, her crew chief said. Instead of dreading another rabble-rousing tactic, Legge had a smart response. In a recent episode of 'Rubbin is Racing', Large, Quigs, and Moonhead were discussing Katherine Legge's Sonoma race. Quigs at first highlighted the fact that stunned the NASCAR community recently. In four Cup races – Phoenix, Mexico City, Chicago, and Sonoma, Legge finished better than Carson Hocevar. Quigs said, “Katherine Legge has finished ahead of Carson Hocevar in all four Cup races she has qualified for.” Then he brought the spotlight to Legge's savage radio response to seeing Hocevar in Sonoma. She said, “What is he doing? …Looking for somebody to give him a decking. I don't think he wants to be the one starting a fight. I think even I could take him.” Eventually, Katherine Legge wound up finishing 31st, one spot ahead of Carson Hocevar. Although her best finish so far has only been 19th at the Chicago Street Race (the first top 20 finish by a female racer since Danica Patrick in 2018), Quigs lauded Legge for her lighthearted banter. “She said this just totally joking around with her spotter, but I kind of like it. You know, at some point, she doored Chase Elliott because he was, I guess, you know, racing her a little bit aggressively. I really don't care if Katherine Legge races again in the NASCAR Cup Series, but while she's here, at least she's having maybe a little bit of fun with it. So, congrats to her.” Clearly, Katherine Legge is attaining the respect of the NASCAR community, one step at a time. Presently, she is ready to take on a new challenge. Adding a new venue to her timeline When Katherine Legge first formulated her NASCAR schedule, people had many doubts. She was the first woman to run a NASCAR race since Danica Patrick. She was even apprehensive about the e.l.f. brand adorning her car with a pink shade: “Oh god, that's so cliché. Do we have to do a pink car?” Following her Phoenix start, Legge faced a backlash from fans for causing twin wrecks and ruining a rival's day. Legge was not spared from vulgarity and death threats for her start. Despite this, Legge doubled down on her effort and persisted. In the Chicago Street Race, she beat Corey Heim at qualifying and clinched a remarkable 19th-place finish. So now, she is ready for the next challenge. On Tuesday this week, the racer announced her plans to compete in the 2025 Brickyard 400. Katherine Legge already has experience at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, having run in the 2023 and 2024 Indy 500s. Now, she is excited to take it a notch further. “It's always an honor to drive at Indy, but having the chance to compete in both the Cup and Xfinity races thanks to Desnuda and Droplight is going to be epic. After racing in the Indy 500 in '23 and '24, I definitely felt a void not being there this year.” She added, “But adding races to my schedule is exactly what I've been working toward. Competing in as many events as possible and logging as many laps as I can.”...","“These young kids are fast, but they haven't made all the mistakes, and they're not scared yet.” This savage comment from Katherine Legge underlined her attitude towards her NASCAR Cup Series debut season.

Servus miteinander, auf den baldigen S&P 500 Neuzugang the Trade Desk habe ich einen 65er Put mit Laufzeit 08. August verkauft. Der aktuelle Kurs liegt bei ca. 81 $, also habe ich ca. 20 % Luft, bis mir 100 Aktien angedient/eingebucht werden. Ich erhalte eine Prämie von knappen 80 $ für gerade einmal ca. 3 Wochen Laufzeit.

mov_5C739BDA1778492665BB1429EBAA0B69,"  Some of the best growth stocks are in the consumer space, and with tariffs still very much front and center, many of these stocks remain well off their highs. Nibbling on these names, say with an initial $1,000 investment, can be a good place to start. Let's look at five consumer-focused stocks to buy now while they're still on sale. These are all solid companies with a lot of potential growth still in front of them. Image source: . 1. Amazon While Amazon (AMZN 0.39%) has rallied from its lows, the stock is still off its highs and attractively valued from a historical perspective. And if there were thoughts that tariffs were slowing consumer spending, the company just announced its largest ever Prime Day sales event. Expanded to four days, the company generated $24.1 billion in sales, according to Adobe Analytics. That's more than double the sales it saw last Black Friday. While Amazon showed it still has what it takes to drive retail sales, what's most exciting about the company is what is going on behind the scenes. Years of investment in logistics, automation, robots, and artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off, and making operations even more efficient. This is leading to cost savings and strong operating leverage. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market-share leader in cloud computing, where customers are using its services to build and deploy their own AI models and tools. It's also developed its own custom chips for training and inference, which gives it both performance and cost advantages. For long-term investors, Amazon is a great stock to own. 2. Alibaba Alibaba (BABA 1.29%) is a stock that remains on sale. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 11 times and has more than 30% of its market cap in cash and investments. The stock is not just cheap, but it's executing on multiple fronts. Its cloud business has now seen AI-related revenue more than double for seven consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, Apple's decision to use Alibaba's Qwen model to power Apple Intelligence in China could be a solid growth driver. The company's e-commerce business has also seen a solid turnaround. Alibaba invested to grow Taobao and Tmall's gross merchandise value, and now it's better monetizing its platforms through new software fees and AI tools. It's also just started with new initiatives to help further drive growth, including offering one-hour delivery and embedding shoppable Taobao links in posts on the popular Chinese Rednote app. In addition, the company continues to grow and scale out its international e-commerce segment, and it expects it to turn profitable soon. Alibaba is still in the midst of its turnaround story, and at its current valuation there's a lot of upside if it continues to execute. 3. E.l.f. Beauty A sudden slowdown in growth last quarter has put e.l.f. Beauty's (ELF 2.20%) stock on the sales rack. However, its pending acquisition of Rhode looks like it could be transformative. E.l.f. has already been one of the biggest winners in the mass-market cosmetics space, and now it's adding a fast-growing premium brand to its portfolio. Rhode generated $212 million in sales over the past year with barely any paid marketing, a limited product lineup, and selling only through its website. That's impressive. Rhode was already set to enter Sephora stores, and now e.l.f. will have the opportunity to plug Rhode into its existing retail relationships, including those with Ulta Beauty and Target, while ramping up product development and marketing. Hailey Bieber remains onboard as chief creative officer, which should help maintain brand momentum as the product line expands. The strategy is smart. Premium skincare brands such as Rhode are simply going to have better margins than mass-market color cosmetics. This is a big opportunity for the company going forward and a reason to own the stock long term. 4. JAKKS Pacific Toy company JAKKS Pacific (JAKK 1.13%) has quietly become one of the best turnaround stories in consumer products. Under CFO John Kimble — formerly of Mattel and Disney — the company has streamlined operations, improved operating margins, and returned to consistent profitability. Shares are up more than 200% over the past five years, but down 30% this year on tariff worries. The result is that the stock trades at just 8.5 times 2025 analyst earnings per share estimates and 6 times the 2026 consensus. And it's not like the company is struggling. Sales jumped 26% in Q1, fueled by licensed products tied to Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Disney's Moana 2. That momentum should continue with toy and costume launches tied to Dog Man, Minecraft, and Paw Patrol....","Some of the best growth stocks are in the consumer space, and with tariffs still very much front and center, many of these stocks remain well off their highs.

mov_CDE1D311FBE394FAA4275BEB2FC22372,"  7 Beauty Products I Can't Survive Summer Without (Seriously, Take My Wallet) I really appreciate you checking out my blog! Just so you know, some of the links in this post are affiliate links. This means that if you buy something through them, I might earn a little bit of money, at no extra cost to you. There's absolutely no pressure to buy anything, but if you do, it genuinely helps support the time and love I put into writing these posts. Summer and I have a complicated relationship. I love the sunshine, the pool days, the iced coffees, and pretending I live in a Pinterest picnic. But I hate how my skin goes into oil factory mode, my makeup melts off faster than my motivation, and my hair turns into a fuzzball that could rival a lion's mane. Over the years, I've tried dozens of beauty products promising to “beat the heat,” but most of them let me down—like that one friend who always cancels last minute. So after way too much trial and error, I've found my ride-or-dies: 7 beauty products I literally cannot live without during the summer months. They're affordable, all on Amazon (because yes, I'm a Prime-addicted human), and they actually do what they claim. Let's get into it. 1. e.l.f. Power Grip Primer Buy on Amazon → Let me start by saying: this stuff is glue. In the best way possible. I used to skip primer because I thought it was a scam. But once summer hits and my foundation starts sliding off like it's auditioning for Cirque du Soleil, I need something to holdit together. This primer grips my makeup like it's its job (because it is) and gives me that smooth, hydrated finish without being greasy. Bonus: It feels just like a dupe for that expensive Milk Makeup one… but it's like $10. Win-win. 2. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Hyaluronic Acid Buy on Amazon → My skin gets confused in the summer. It's dry in patches, oily in others, and occasionally acts like it's mad at me for drinking iced coffee instead of water. This gel moisturizer saved me. It's light, cooling, and soaks in like a dream without leaving a film. I use it morning and night—and sometimes right after I come in from the heat, just to feel something soothing. It feels like giving my skin a tall glass of water. No breakouts, no sticky residue, just happy, bouncy skin. 3. NYX Bare With Me Concealer Serum Buy on Amazon → Foundation in the summer? No thank you. I'm not trying to bake a cake on my face. Instead, I've been living for this lightweight concealer serum. It's buildable, blends like a dream, and looks like skin—not like a mask. I use it under my eyes, around my nose, and on any little blemish trying to ruin my day. It doesn't crease, doesn't melt, and somehow makes me look like I actually slept last night. Which, spoiler: I didn't. 4. Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant Buy on Amazon → Let's talk clogged pores. Summer means sweat, sunscreen, and leftover makeup—and all that stuff loves to hang out in my pores like uninvited guests. I started using this exfoliant a few nights a week and noticed a huge difference. My skin looks smoother, my breakouts are way less intense, and those weird little bumps on my forehead? Gone. It's a holy grail product for a reason. Just make sure you wear sunscreen during the day (but you're already doing that, right? RIGHT?) . 5. Pacifica Underarm Deodorant Wipes Buy on Amazon → Okay, hear me out: I never thought I needed deodorant wipes… until I did. One day I was running late to a brunch, totally forgot deodorant, and grabbed one of these from my glove box out of desperation.

n3uc3ut,"  In terms of learning to paint your nails better, it all comes down to practice! [Here's an article with some tips & tricks from bloggers](https://www.nailcarehq.com/how-to-paint-nails) on how to paint your nails like a pro! You could also look up more videos on YouTube, as there are a ton of tutorials there as well! The main thing is learning polish control, making sure that there isn't too much polish on the brush but there's still enough that you can coat the entire nail without having to dip back into the bottle. This will come with practice & will change depending on the length of your nails. What I like to do is kinda wiggle the wand (what the brush is attached to) against the inside of the neck of the bottle to make sure there isn't a bunch of polish that's gonna drip down & then swipe most of the polish off one side of the brush. [Here's a little video to better explain!] (https://www.reddit.com/user/juleznailedithelps/comments/ka06vu/polish_control/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) When painting your nails, you're bound to end up with polish somewhere you don't want it to be. You can use a toothpick, a cuticle pusher, or anything small and pointed to kinda scrape the flooded polish out of your cuticles. After removing that excess polish, you can take a small brush (angled eyeliner brushes or small concealer brushes work great for this!) dipped in acetone to gently clean up any remaining polish on your cuticles. The $1 E.L.F. concealer/eyeliner brushes are a super popular option for clean up brushes! I also like to use a [dappen dish](https://www.sallybeauty.com/nails/acrylic-nails/glass-dappen-dish/SBS-154855.html) (you can also buy them on Amazon!) to pour my acetone into so I'm not having to dip into the big container of acetone (a few people have accidentally dropped their brushes in the bottle lol).","In terms of learning to paint your nails better, it all comes down to practice!

Beauty deal in May Michelle Lee Link copied Jerritt Clark/ Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber in 2023 NEED TO KNOW A rep for Hailey Bieber confirms to PEOPLE that the $1 billion from Rhode's e.l.f. Beauty acquisition has nothing to do with husband Justin Bieber's financial settlement Rumors began circulating that Justin Bieber postponed the settlement until Hailey's deal was funded, but her rep says the deal is ""separate"" from the singer's ""business affairs"" Earlier this month, the singer agreed to pay his former manager Scooter Braun $31.5 million, a majority of which will go toward an advance for his Justice Tour that Braun's company had covered Hailey Bieber is standing on business, despite what rumors may say about where the money from her $1 billion Rhode deal is going. Earlier this month, her husband, Justin Bieber, settled a financial dispute with his former manager Scooter Braun. The singer, 31, agreed to pay $26 million to Braun's former company HYBE as part of an advance the singer received from AEG Presents for his ultimately canceled 2022 Justice Tour, plus an additional $5.5 million to cover half of the $11 million in unpaid commissions he owed Braun. TMZ was first to report on July 10 that Bieber and Braun settled the dispute, the same day it was revealed that Bieber would be releasing his seventh album, Swag, and that he had launched his fashion brand SKYLRK. Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic Justin and Hailey Bieber at the 2022 Grammys At the same time, rumors began circulating that the Grammy winner waited to settle his debt after Hailey, 28, secured her $1 billion from e.l.f Beauty's acquisition of her brand Rhode in May. However, a rep for Hailey confirms to PEOPLE that Rhode's business move is in no way associated with her husband's settlement. “The historic sale of rhode is a huge accomplishment for Hailey and is completely separate from her husband and his business affairs."" The acquisition of Hailey's company, which she launched in 2022, occurred on May 28. She will continue her role as founder and additionally serve as Rhode's chief creative officer and head of innovation, overseeing creative, product innovation and marketing.

In ihrer Instagram-Story teilte die 28-Jährige ein Foto einer entzündeten Stelle an ihrer unteren Wange. Dabei erklärte sie, dass sie aktuell wieder mit einem Schub ihrer ""perioralen Dermatitis"" zu kämpfen habe – ein Hautausschlag, der laut E! News rund um den Mund auftritt. Hailey schreibt in ihrer Story: ""Es bricht immer dann aus, wenn ich viel unterwegs bin, zu wenig Schlaf habe, durch Hormone, die falsche Sonnencreme, neue Produkte und Stress."" Hailey kennt sich mit der Hauterkrankung inzwischen bestens aus, denn laut E! News leidet sie bereits seit über zehn Jahren darunter. Ihre Pflegeroutine hält sie in solchen Phasen bewusst schlicht und setzt auf beruhigende, entzündungshemmende Produkte. ""So minimal"", schreibt sie in ihrer Story und verrät ihre Routine: ""Gesicht mit Wasser abspülen, verschriebenes Azelainsäure-Gel, hypochlorige Säure, Clindamycin, Glazing Milk."" Bereits im März hatte Hailey offen über einen ähnlichen Schub gesprochen. ""Ich habe eine bessere Balance darin gefunden, wie ich meine Haut in den verschiedenen Phasen und Zuständen behandle"", erklärte sie im Dear Media's Breaking Beauty Podcast. Hautpflege und Beauty gehören für Hailey zum Alltag. Erst vor Kurzem verkaufte sie ihre Beauty-Marke Rhode an das Kosmetikunternehmen e.l.f. Beauty. Die Marke hatte sie vor drei Jahren gegründet und die Nachricht im Mai stolz auf Instagram verkündet. Trotz des Verkaufs bleibt sie der Marke jedoch weiterhin eng verbunden. Als Chief Creative Officer und Head of Innovation wird sie weiterhin die kreative Ausrichtung bestimmen und zusätzlich als strategische Beraterin für e.l.f. tätig sein. Dass sie dabei so offen mit eigenen Hautproblemen umgeht, macht Hailey für viele Fans besonders nahbar – und zeigt, dass selbst eine Beauty-Ikone nicht immer makellose Haut haben muss.

Promising review: ""I swear by this. Been using it for about a year now, it goes on every day and gets all the redness off my face, when I'm in a hurry I just top it off with a little powder and I'm done but it's a perfect base layer for any makeup routine if you had a lot of redness like I do."" –Andrea Get it from Amazon for $9.98+ (available in two sizes and also other styles). 2. And an ultra-affordable E.l.f. color corrector that comes in a ton of shades to help counteract different types of discoloration, like redness and dark spots.

Easy to apply and enough coverage — not cakey, which I liked the most. And it lasts a long time without creasing."" —Vish Get it from Amazon for $4 (available in five shades). 3.

mov_BE18076EF2AB75B4B8FD40C99C06CF84,"  by 19/07/2025 APEX / MEGA Justin Bieber, fresh off the release of his new album “Swag” and a series of carefully curated family photos, appears to be projecting an image of renewed confidence. However, beneath the surface, sources close to the pop star reveal a more complex reality: a struggle with persistent personal challenges, fluctuating moods, and growing tensions within his marriage to Hailey Bieber. The new album itself offers a glimpse into this internal conflict, featuring introspective interludes that feel strikingly candid, almost like therapy sessions laid bare. This vulnerability comes as Hailey Bieber's Rhode beauty brand experiences unprecedented success, recently securing a landmark $1 billion deal, adding another layer to the dynamic within the couple. Justin Bieber's Comeback: A Mask for Underlying Struggles? MEGA Released on July 11th, “Swag” was accompanied by a series of polished family portraits featuring Bieber, Hailey, and their 11-month-old son, Jack Blues. While the images portray a picture of domestic bliss, insiders suggest this carefully constructed facade may be concealing deeper turmoil. Reports indicate a pattern of increasingly frequent disagreements with paparazzi, subtle displays of friction between Justin and Hailey on social media, and erratic behavior in the months leading up to the album's launch. “He doesn't particularly handle [fame] well,” a source confided to Page Six. “Imagine being thrust into the spotlight at 14, constantly subjected to both adoration and intense scrutiny. It's a pressure cooker that breaks many people. I'm genuinely concerned for him.” Another celebrity insider echoed these concerns, stating Bieber “still has underlying issues” that continue to surface. Did You Know? : Justin Bieber first gained widespread recognition at the age of 15 after being discovered on YouTube by talent manager Scooter Braun. The Singer Gets Real About Fame, Family, and Finding His Way Raw Image LTD/MEGA Four years after the release of “Justice” and two years following the abrupt cancellation of his world tour due to health concerns, Bieber's latest project marks a shift in tone. Now a father, the 31-year-old artist presents a more subdued and introspective persona. The album notably features three interludes with comedian Druski, one of which, titled “Therapy Sessions,” provides a direct window into Bieber's struggles with public perception. “What's been a tough thing for me recently is feeling like I have had to go through a lot of my struggles as a human, as all of us do, really publicly,” Bieber shared during the interlude, with Druski acting as his counselor. “And so people are always asking if I'm OK, and that starts to really weigh on me. It starts to make me feel like I'm the one with the issues and everyone else is perfect.” Justin Bieber's Public Struggles, Marriage Woes, and a Family Under Scrutiny zz/XNY/starmaxinc. com/Newscom/MEGA A source familiar with Bieber's situation told Page Six that his recent social media posts have reflected a sense of frustration and inner turmoil. “If you have a friend and they're posting [like that] – I can tell he's angry just by looking at his posts,” the source explained. “He has mood swings – he's kind of an extreme personality in that sense.” The lyrics of “Walking Away” hint at potential strains in his marriage to Hailey, with lines like: “Days go by so fast, don't wanna spend them with you / So tell me why you're throwing stones at my back / You know I'm defenseless. Girl, we better stop before we say some sh–t / We've been testing our patience / I think we better off if we just take a break.” The couple has made concerted efforts to protect their son, Jack Blues, from the relentless glare of the paparazzi. However, some have questioned Bieber's decision to feature the 11-month-old on the album cover, even with his face obscured. “He obviously wants to protect his kid. But it's like 'Oh, we want privacy,' then they put the kid on album covers and books,” a celebrity insider observed. What do you think about the pressures of fame on young artists like Justin Bieber? And how can celebrities navigate the challenges of maintaining a private life while living in the public eye? With Hailey Bieber's Empire Rising, What's Next for Her Husband? MEGA Financially, the Bieber family appears secure, largely due to Hailey's thriving Rhode beauty brand. The company recently finalized a $1 billion deal with e.l.f. Cosmetics, including $800 million in cash and an additional $200 million contingent on future growth. This success has led to speculation about Justin Bieber's next move. The question of whether Bieber will embark on a tour to support “Swag” remains unanswered. Insiders suggest this decision is particularly significant given Hailey's company's rapid expansion. Those close to the singer believe a return to the stage could be beneficial for both his professional and personal well-being. “He needs to perform,” a celebrity insider stated....","by 19/07/2025 APEX / MEGA Justin Bieber, fresh off the release of his new album “Swag” and a series of carefully curated family photos, appears to be projecting an image of renewed confidence.

Did You Know? : Justin Bieber first gained widespread recognition at the age of 15 after being discovered on YouTube by talent manager Scooter Braun. The Singer Gets Real About Fame, Family, and Finding His Way Raw Image LTD/MEGA Four years after the release of “Justice” and two years following the abrupt cancellation of his world tour due to health concerns, Bieber's latest project marks a shift in tone. Now a father, the 31-year-old artist presents a more subdued and introspective persona. The album notably features three interludes with comedian Druski, one of which, titled “Therapy Sessions,” provides a direct window into Bieber's struggles with public perception. “What's been a tough thing for me recently is feeling like I have had to go through a lot of my struggles as a human, as all of us do, really publicly,” Bieber shared during the interlude, with Druski acting as his counselor. “And so people are always asking if I'm OK, and that starts to really weigh on me. It starts to make me feel like I'm the one with the issues and everyone else is perfect.” Justin Bieber's Public Struggles, Marriage Woes, and a Family Under Scrutiny zz/XNY/starmaxinc. com/Newscom/MEGA A source familiar with Bieber's situation told Page Six that his recent social media posts have reflected a sense of frustration and inner turmoil. “If you have a friend and they're posting [like that] – I can tell he's angry just by looking at his posts,” the source explained. “He has mood swings – he's kind of an extreme personality in that sense.” The lyrics of “Walking Away” hint at potential strains in his marriage to Hailey, with lines like: “Days go by so fast, don't wanna spend them with you / So tell me why you're throwing stones at my back / You know I'm defenseless. Girl, we better stop before we say some sh–t / We've been testing our patience / I think we better off if we just take a break.” The couple has made concerted efforts to protect their son, Jack Blues, from the relentless glare of the paparazzi. However, some have questioned Bieber's decision to feature the 11-month-old on the album cover, even with his face obscured. “He obviously wants to protect his kid. But it's like 'Oh, we want privacy,' then they put the kid on album covers and books,” a celebrity insider observed. What do you think about the pressures of fame on young artists like Justin Bieber? And how can celebrities navigate the challenges of maintaining a private life while living in the public eye? With Hailey Bieber's Empire Rising, What's Next for Her Husband? MEGA Financially, the Bieber family appears secure, largely due to Hailey's thriving Rhode beauty brand. The company recently finalized a $1 billion deal with e.l.f. Cosmetics, including $800 million in cash and an additional $200 million contingent on future growth. This success has led to speculation about Justin Bieber's next move. The question of whether Bieber will embark on a tour to support “Swag” remains unanswered. Insiders suggest this decision is particularly significant given Hailey's company's rapid expansion. Those close to the singer believe a return to the stage could be beneficial for both his professional and personal well-being. “He needs to perform,” a celebrity insider stated....",2025-07-19 21:55:00,en,WEB,,,,141b4040361377af99225a9f4feb33e0,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,This is a detailed celebrity news article about Justin Bieber that happens to mention E.L.F.
