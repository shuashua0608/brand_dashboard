mov_1AE63CE710377EE023D4A79AC384E892,"  Big moment for Manchester and music fans alike this weekend: Oasis stormed back on stage at Heaton Park for gigs that have been dubbed both “biblical” and “heaven on earth”. And it didn't hurt that the weather delivered either. It might have been blazing 30 degrees sunshine and blue skies, but it still saw Liam Gallagher, forever a man of the overcoat, donning a lightweight jacket in the soaring heat while on stage. However, he wasn't the only one in the Gallagher clan wearing unseasonal outerwear. Liam's 24-year-old son Gene was also sporting a stylish jacket that some fans thought looked rather familiar. Posting a picture on Instagram, Gene posed pre-show with his cousins, brother and Pep Guardiola(!) , wearing the distinctive item. The navy, zip-up jacket – that he wore over a plain black t-shirt – has the unmistakable cross-hatching of Burberry; but one fan was quick to pick up on its bigger significance. “Is that ya dad's Maine Road top”, they asked under the pic, meaning the jacket Liam wore on stage at Oasis's April 1996 gig in Manchester's Maine Road (which can actually be watched in full here). “The exact one,” Gene confirmed, adding: “It's a family heirloom.” Another user chimed in on its potential origin story further: “If I'm not wrong my mate was the manager and worked in Ath-Leisure (owned by JD Sports) store in the Arndale Manchester and sold this to your dad just before Night 1 Maine Rd…. . always wondered if it was kept.” While we're obviously unable to verify this, we can confirm that 29 years later, the look still absolutely slaps. Here's hoping we see Yung Gallagher – or indeed his brother, Lennon – dive through more of his da's iconic wardrobe for the remaining nights of the reunion tour.","Big moment for Manchester and music fans alike this weekend: Oasis stormed back on stage at Heaton Park for gigs that have been dubbed both “biblical” and “heaven on earth”.

mov_304EA9B9BEE315180686CF4161562046,"  Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer highlights three market-moving stories to watch on Monday, July 14, on Morning Brief: Market Sunrise. Stock futures (ES=F, NQ=F, YM=F) are trading lower as tariff threats from President Trump weigh on investor sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hit a fresh all-time high above $122,000 as investors eye crypto as a potential safe haven. Wall Street is also bracing for key inflation data and a flood of earnings, with CPI and big bank results including JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Citigroup (C) on deck. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief: Market Sunrise here. 00:00 Speaker A Let's kick it off with the three things you need to know before the opening bell rings by taking a look at the futures board. As you can see, all three, uh, all three futures indexes tied to the major indexes in the US in the red. You can see your S&P 500 futures off about 0.3%, and this is as tariffs are once again in focus. New letters from the President, from President Trump over the weekend, threatened 30% duties on Mexico and the European Union. The latest tariff actions follow a 35% tariff on Canadian goods announced last week. In response, the European Union says it will delay its plans to impose tariffs on US exports to the EU, which had initially been slated for Tuesday, according to the Financial Times. Italy's Foreign Minister, Antonio Taiani, said in a newspaper interview Monday that the EU is prepared with a list of tariffs amounting to more than $24 billion on US goods, should the two sides fail to reach a deal. The latest tariff back and forth has caught the market's attention with the US dollar edging slightly higher on Monday morning against the euro, while European stocks are taking a step lower, and futures tied to those major US stock indexes are also in the red. As tariffs continue to batter the headlines, a potential flight to safety trade continues to balloon in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin surpassing $122,000 earlier this morning, cracking another fresh all-time high. The world's largest cryptocurrency is now up about 10% in the past week alone and more than 30% this year. US stocks linked to crypto are seeing a pop in pre-market. Michael Sailor strategy, which holds a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet, up about 2% in pre-market trading, while Coinbase and Robinhood exchanges that trade crypto are both up more than 1%. And finally, investors are readying for a big week of expected news releases and economic data and quarterly financial reports. Inflation reports from both the US and Europe will be in particular focus. On Tuesday morning, the core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, is expected to show price increases accelerated in the US during June. Consensus expects core CPI rose 2.9% over the prior year in June, a step higher from the 2.8% seen in May. Economists believe an increase in line with those expectations will likely prompt the Federal Reserve to once again hold interest rates steady at its July policy meeting. On the corporate front, earnings from large banks, including JP Morgan and Bank of America, will be in focus, while investors will also closely be watching for any tariff related impacts at corporates, including Pepsi, ASML, and Burberry. The latest data from FactSet shows analysts expect S&P 500 earnings grew by just under 5% over the prior year during the second quarter. Should this forecast come true, it will mark the slowest pace of profit growth since the fourth quarter of 2023.

mov_72986CA310AC3B29CFD8ABD43F4EE16C,"  The biggest airport serving Italy's fashion capital of Milan has strengthened its high-end retail offer by introducing French heavyweights Dior and Louis Vuitton to anchor its luxury line-up with the largest boutiques at the gateway. Milan Malpensa Airport—which handled almost 30 million passengers last year, up 11%—is continuing its strategy of establishing itself as a premier European destination for high-end shopping. The operator, SEA Milan Airports, which also runs the smaller airport of Milan Linate, is stepping up its luxury offer in line with the city's rising popularity as a place to shop tax-free. According to tax refund specialist Global Blue, between December 2024 and February 2025), Milan accounted for 9% of total tax-free sales in Continental Europe with an average spend of €2,240 ($2,615), bettered only by Paris with a 22% share and average spending of €2,660 ($3,105). Both the Dior and Louis Vuitton boutiques are directly operated by the brands and have significant footprints at about 4,800 and 6,100 square feet, respectively. They take the number of luxury brands at Malpensa to 22, not including various corners and pop-ups within Avolta's large duty-free stores at the airport. The two new arrivals are strategically located in one of the most prominent areas of Terminal 1, and their eye-catching storefronts are now the first to be seen by passengers as they exit the security area into the retail spaces. Other big-name boutiques in T1 include Armani, Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Bulgari, Damiani, Hermès, Ferragamo, Moncler, Tod's and Zegna, many of them centered around a Davide Oldani Cafè. Luigi Battuello, chief commercial officer of SEA, commented: “With the arrival of Dior and Louis Vuitton, Malpensa cements its status as a benchmark for premium airport shopping. The investment by these iconic brands reflects our vision of an increasingly international, modern gateway—credible to partners and attentive to the needs of global travellers.” Milan lures global luxury shoppers Last year, T1 had the most international passengers of any SEA terminal and/or airports at 30%. European passengers accounted for 21%, North Americans 4%, and North Mediterranean Africa and the Middle East passengers, 2%. Intercontinental air traffic at Malpensa has been growing again and should support Dior and Louis Vuitton, both of which have been expanding at key hub airport like Qatar's Hamad International and others. In the first five months of 2025, luxury sales increased by a solid 18% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by the rise in high-spending international travelers. Average transaction value also rose by more than 9% year-over-year. This builds on an already strong 2024 for luxury, which was up a very healthy 21%. As with most airports in Europe, high-end retail sales drivers are non-European Union passengers, particularly from Asia and the Middle East. They account for over 80% of luxury purchases. T1 is, by far, the strongest terminal for non-EU customers. In 2024, across the SEA network (Malpensa and Linate combined), sales rose by 15% reaching record commercial revenue of €470 million ($550 million). Food and beverage ticked up higher at 16.6%. Malpensa has created a high-end commercial district at the airport, claiming to have a shopping experience “on par” with Milan's downtown Quadrilatero della Moda fashion district, where streets like Via Monte Napoleone are world famous and a magnet for luxury shoppers from all over the world. Global Blue ranks Milan ahead of Florence and Rome as the most strategic destination for international travel shopping in Italy. The fashion capital benefits from Italy's global reputation for fashion and craftsmanship, although this is being tarnished by scrutiny into alleged abuse of workers through subcontracting practices. Loro Piana, an LVMH house known for cashmere items, became the fifth high-end label in Italy to be put under judicial administration following investigations that started in 2023.","The biggest airport serving Italy's fashion capital of Milan has strengthened its high-end retail offer by introducing French heavyweights Dior and Louis Vuitton to anchor its luxury line-up with the largest boutiques at the gateway.

Originally designed for farmers and fishermen, the practical headwear made its way into pop culture via the hip-hop scene in the 80s and 90s, when the likes of LL Cool J and Run-DMC sported the look. It wasn't long before scores of bucket hats began popping up at British festivals, attendees no doubt drawn to their waterproof and sun-shading qualities - who doesn't have trust issues when it comes to summer weather? - plus their ability to mask greasy, unwashed hair and roll up tightly in a backpack without destroying the design.

AllSaints Skye Bucket Hat Your new festival favourite, AllSaints washed denim look nails the Nineties brief. Pair with hoops and smudged eyeliner for an instant cool girl look. JiaTL WeyJia Women's Bucket Hat Crochet comes into its own in the summer, but the look isn't just for the beach.

A cross between cotton candy and vanilla, it's just so fresh. It makes my skin smooth all day. This large bottle will last me a couple of months. Thank you, Eos, for such a fantastic lotion.  "" —Erin ""Very similar to my Burberry fragrance, and they layer beautifully. I always get tons of compliments on the scent. I also purchase the jasmine and berry  for a more fruity option but to me it just smells like regular lotion. Cost per use is well worth it considering how thick the lotion is. It also actually moisturizes while leaving a fragrance behind instead of drying my skin out due to the perfume. I have sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions."" —Violet Frahm Get it from Amazon for $9.97 (available in various scents and packs). 2. A tube of Essence's Lash Princess Mascara to give you a falsies-level look for less than five bucks. It seems questionable, I know, but for confirmation, you need only look at the 262,000+ 5-star reviews!! Promising review: ""After using Lights, Camera, Lashes by Tarte for the past year, I got tired of breaking the bank over mascara. My sister suggested Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect and I IMMEDIATELY fell in love. It provides dramatic length and great volume. I can honestly say I can't stop looking at my eyelashes in the mirror every single day because of how awesome they look. Also, it is very long-wearing. I go from an eight-hour workday right to the gym and sweat [a lot]. . and this stuff doesn't budge! I love it!!"" —Carrie E Weikert Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (available in black or brown and as a three-pack). 3. A long-sleeve bodysuit in a deliciously soft fabric — known as Smoke Cloud — that reviewers compare to Skims. They say it washes well, too, so you can count on it being high quality despite the deceivingly low price! And BTW, reviewers say the double lining in the torso is supportive, so they don't need to wear a bra. Promising review: ""Are you kidding me? This is the softest, most comfortable body suit I've ever owned. I got so many compliments lol; everyone did think they were Skims lol, but it's definitely worth every penny. I love and will be getting more colors!!! You need it."" —Wendy L. Get it from Amazon for $28.99 (available in women's sizes XS–3X and 13 colors). And check out all the styles available in the Smoke Cloud fabric here. 4. Elizavecca's Collagen Coating Hair Protein Treatment — it works just like a hair mask to repair your locks in five minutes flat. The ceramide 3- and collagen-packed formula repairs all types of hair, whether you've got over-processed tresses or 4c hair that's susceptible to dryness.

mov_856DC85870CB3AE9945ED6B83F69C219,"  The year 2025 has proven to be an extremely difficult one for fashion, which finds itself crushed by socio-economic pressures on all fronts, luxury included. Nonetheless, while major companies like Burberry are forced to make staff cuts, CEOs are doing better than ever. According to a new report from WWD, out of 50 executive leaders working in the fashion sector, 25 have recorded salary increases of at least $10 million in the past year. And that's just in America. Among the brands with the best-paid CEOs, according to the publication, are David Simon of Simon Property Group, one of the largest mall owners in the country, who received an annual salary of $61 million, followed by Doug Herrington of Amazon, Doug McMillon of Walmart, and Ralph Lauren of his namesake brand, who received a compensation package worth $24.1 million. Based on last year's data, in 2024 the 25 highest-paid CEOs in American fashion received salary increases amounting to 23.5%. Even though CEOs bear great responsibilities, the steep salary increases they secured in the past year are hard to justify. And while it's true that they're not actually paid in dollars but in stock and option awards depending on business goals (not only their own, of course), it's certainly not the case that what they earned before wasn't enough. Let's return to the example of Burberry's CEO to show how unnecessary these bonuses may be: on top of a substantial salary (almost £2.6 million, which seems small compared to the Americans), the new Burberry CEO received £380,000 for the relocation, £135,000 to find a new home, £120,000 for the move from New York, and five months of fully paid housing allowance, according to the Guardian. In a sensitive time like this, when artisans in fashion districts are on strike because they don't feel respected, and the entire apparel and accessories market shows serious signs of collapse, where changes in creative leadership make brands' futures even more uncertain, the news of CEO salary increases makes the luxury sector seem truly out of touch—though it's always been that way.","The year 2025 has proven to be an extremely difficult one for fashion, which finds itself crushed by socio-economic pressures on all fronts, luxury included.

A través de su cuenta de X (antes Twitter), contó con humor que había estado hospitalizada por una hernia causada por usar pantalones extremadamente ajustados. “'Suki, ya no tuiteas'... ¿Sabías que hace seis meses usé unos pantalones tan apretados que me causaron una hernia y tuve demasiado miedo de decírtelo?” , escribió junto a una fotografía suya desde la cama del hospital y otra sobre el escenario, donde luce los infames pantalones verdes que habrían sido los culpables. El contraste de las imágenes causó furor. Mira: Muere cantante argentina a los 36 años que padecía cáncer; ¡afirmaba curarse con la música! ¿Qué es una hernia y cómo puede causarla la ropa apretada? Aunque suene como algo que solo pasa en Hollywood, el caso de la cantante britanica Suki puso bajo los reflectores un tema poco discutido: los efectos de la ropa ajustada en la salud. Una hernia ocurre cuando parte del intestino o tejido sobresale a través de un punto débil en los músculos abdominales, y aunque no es común que la ropa apretada lo cause directamente, sí puede agravar una condición preexistente. La Clínica Mayo señala que la presión constante sobre la zona abdominal, como la ejercida por jeans ceñidos o cinturones muy ajustados, podría complicar cuadros médicos latentes o impedir una correcta presión intraabdominal. En casos extremos, como el de Suki, la estética puede terminar pasando una factura bastante alta. Lee: Muere famosa cantante de ska tras ser diagnosticada con cáncer; así confirmaron su partida: “No fue fácil” ¿Cómo reaccionaron sus fans tras la confesión viral de Suki Waterhouse, la famosa cantante? La revelación no solo sorprendió por lo peculiar del motivo, sino por la manera en que Waterhouse lo compartió. Las redes estallaron con comentarios como: “En el escenario con pantalones de cuero y luego conectada a un suero en el hospital, como una verdadera estrella de rock”. Su honestidad fue aplaudida por miles de seguidores, quienes valoraron que hablara abiertamente de un problema de salud sin caer en dramatismos. Su actitud relajada pero directa logró que se abriera un debate sobre los peligros de anteponer la moda al bienestar físico. ¿Podría afectar la hernia la carrera o gira musical de Suki Waterhouse? Hasta el momento, la famosa cantante no ha confirmado si tendrá que hacer ajustes a su calendario de presentaciones, pero todo indica que su recuperación va avanzando. En general, las hernias inguinales pueden requerir cirugía o reposo prolongado, lo que podría afectar actividades físicas intensas. Para alguien como Suki, que constantemente está en conciertos, alfombras rojas y grabaciones, esto podría significar un cambio temporal de ritmo. Sin embargo, su actitud positiva sugiere que seguirá adelante con su carrera, ahora con ropa un poco más holgada. Mira: Esta famosa actriz y cantante mexicana de las décadas de los 60 y 70 ¡actualmente vive en la calle! Así luce ¿Quién es Suki Waterhouse la cantante que fue a dar al hospital por una hernia?

But make no mistake — they care deeply about what your brand stands for. The difference? They read it through your design. Your typeface. Your visual tone. Instantly. The smartest brands in the world know this. That's why they've radically overhauled their logos, typography, and identities — not to erase history, but to express it in a modern, mobile-native way. Here are six iconic brands that updated their logos between 2023 and 2025 to speak Gen Z fluently: Jaguar (2024) Out with the “growler.” In with a sleek, angular leaper and mixed-case logotype framed by 16 sharp lines. Electric, premium, digital. Bentley Motors, Inc. - Americas Region (2025) Refined the Winged B — feathers gone, falcon-inspired diamond wings in. Minimalism meets mobile-first prestige. Burberry (2023) Ditching Helvetica for a curled serif and reviving the Equestrian Knight. Heritage reimagined for digital storytelling. Amazon (2025) Rolled out “Ember Modern” — a warm, unified, custom typeface across all sub-brands. Approachable, consistent, scalable design. Moët & Chandon (2023) Modernized its crest with a clean badge, updated crown, and simplified luxury palette. The past, distilled into elegance and structure. Liquid Death (2024) A water brand wrapped in gothic fonts, heavy-metal energy, and irreverent meme culture. Hydration with attitude — and 3.7 million Gen Z followers to prove it. This is not about aesthetics. It's about story clarity. Gen Z wants to know who you are — but you've got 2 seconds, no sound, and 100px to say it. Your design is your narrative.

mov_BC5520BE086DF8B289EE9BD9104520B6,"  A “challenging” luxury market and retreat from gaming have prompted a fall in sales and profits at Mike Ashley's Frasers. The group, which is majority owned by the billionaire former Newcastle United owner, said sales fell 7.4% to £4.7bn and pre-tax profits slid 24% to £379.5m as it closed some of its House of Fraser department stores and Game video game shops. Sales in its 'premium lifestyle' division, which includes Flannels, House of Fraser and brands such as Pretty Green bought from JD Sports, slumped almost 15% as it said “the luxury market continued to be challenging”, although Frasers said it was “now showing some early signs of improvement”. Many luxury businesses, including the UK's Burberry and Mulberry, have struggled amid a slowdown in spending by aspirational shoppers. That group of consumers, who typically treat themselves to an occasional luxury fashion item, have seen their budgets constrained by high interest rates, increased household bills and rising prices. Related: The rise in unemployment shows the UK jobs market is cooling, but it is not collapsing Despite the problems, Frasers said its “long-term ambitions for the luxury business remain unchanged” and it had consolidated its store estate to “further strengthen our position”. The FTSE 250 listed group said that after “an especially weak period” in the wake of last October's budget, “UK consumer confidence and trading conditions improved into 2025, and recent sales trends have been more encouraging”. Adjusted profits rose 2.8% to £560m, it said. It is expecting underlying profits similar to this year as it said it was working to offset at least £50m of additional costs linked to changes made in the budget, including an increase in employers' national insurance contributions. The changes, introduced in April, have already provoked a backlash from business groups against the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who is widely expected to be forced to raise taxes again in her autumn budget. Related: Jaguar Land Rover to axe 500 UK management jobs as Trump tariffs fallout dents sales Frasers said it would continue to invest in improving the image of its Sports Direct chain, which had a rise in sales. This improvement, however, was offset by closures of its Game video games outlets and falling sales at its Studio Retail online business, leading to an overall fall of 7.2% in Frasers' sports division. The company said it was investing in Sports Direct with a “significant recent step up in international expansion”. It continued to open outlets for its Flannels luxury streetwear chain, including in Leeds and Sheffield. Michael Murray, the chief executive of Frasers, said: “We accelerated our international expansion, announcing partnerships in Australia, Asia and [the Middle East and Europe], to further build Sports Direct into a truly worldwide proposition. “Our relationships with the world's best global brands, including Nike, Adidas and Hugo Boss, are the strongest they have ever been, and our ambitious growth plans are now strengthening and scaling these partnerships even further.”","A “challenging” luxury market and retreat from gaming have prompted a fall in sales and profits at Mike Ashley's Frasers.

Meet them all, including her current rumored relationship with Brandon Green. View gallery Image Credit: Getty Images At just the age of 11, Emma Watson cemented her spot in the pop culture zeitgeist due to her role as Hermione Granger, the quick witted and precocious witch in the Harry Potter film franchise. The actress and activist, 31, has made a name for herself since the debut of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. She has gone on to star in other notable film projects, including The Bling Ring, Beauty and the Beast, and Little Women. With a high-profile career comes high-profile relationships, but Emma has made it a point to keep her personal life as far away from the spotlight as possible. Below, look back at Emma's past boyfriends and relationships. Francis Boulle Emma and Francis, an English diamond heir and entrepreneur who starred in the reality series Made in Chelsea, were briefly linked in 2008. He told Heat in 2011 that he broke things off because he wanted to achieve his “own notoriety,” saying, “I have always been an ambitious person and I want to achieve my own notoriety for what I've done. That's why I chose not to pursue it any longer, because I didn't want to be the boyfriend of some child actress.” He called Emma a “really cool person.” Jay Barrymore Emma and Jay, an English financier, dated between 2008 and 2009. They reportedly split due to the long distance: Emma attended college at Brown University in the States at the time, while Jay lived in the United Kingdom. “The transatlantic gap proved too much for their relationship to survive,” a source told Irish Examiner. Rafael Cebrián Emma and Rafael, a Spanish musician and actor, dated between late 2009 and 2010 after meeting at Brown. They were first spotted at the hockey game between the Florida Panthers and New York Rangers in New York in November 2009. George Craig Emma and George, an English singer and model, were briefly linked in 2010. They met on set of a Burberry campaign. The Harry Potter actress even starred in the music video for his band, One Night Only, for the song “Say You Don't Want It” that year. Johnny Simmons Emma and Johnny, an American actor who starred opposite the actress in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, briefly dated in 2011, a year before the film came out. The two were spotted kissing outside of restaurant in Santa Monica in August of that year. “They have really fallen for one another and both aren't dating anyone else,” a source told Hollywood Life at the time. Will Adamowicz Emma and Will, a fellow student she met when she attended the University of Oxford in England, dated between late 2011 and 2013. They were first spotted kissing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2012. The actress' rep confirmed to multiple outlets in 2014 that they called it quits and were “no longer in touch.” Matthew Janney Emma and Matthew, a fellow student at Oxford and rugby player, dated for nearly a year in 2014. In the September 2015 issue of British Vogue, Emma called the split “horrendous,” revealing she went on a weeklong silent retreat to figure out how to be single. “I felt really uncomfortable,” she said. “Even before my relationship ended, I went on a silent retreat, because I really wanted to figure out how to be at home with myself.” Roberto Aguire Emma and Roberto, an actor known for his roles in Pretty Little Liars and NCIS: New Orleans, were briefly linked in 2015. The longtime friends met on set of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, where Roberto interned in the special effects department, he previously revealed to JustJared. He called Emma “one of my best friends.” William “Mack” Knight Emma and William, a tech entrepreneur who worked in Silicon Valley, dated between 2015 and 2017, keeping the relationship low key. In her March 2017 cover story for Vanity Fair, Emma explained why she wouldn't speak publicly about her boyfriend. “I want to be consistent: I can't talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home,” she said. “You can't have it both ways. I've noticed, in Hollywood, who you're dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act.”...","Emma Watson's Boyfriends: Everyone the 'Harry Potter' Star Has Dated Before The 'Harry Potter' star never found love with any of her childhood co-stars, but Emma Watson's boyfriend history proves she's known love.

In the September 2015 issue of British Vogue, Emma called the split “horrendous,” revealing she went on a weeklong silent retreat to figure out how to be single. “I felt really uncomfortable,” she said. “Even before my relationship ended, I went on a silent retreat, because I really wanted to figure out how to be at home with myself.” Roberto Aguire Emma and Roberto, an actor known for his roles in Pretty Little Liars and NCIS: New Orleans, were briefly linked in 2015. The longtime friends met on set of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, where Roberto interned in the special effects department, he previously revealed to JustJared. He called Emma “one of my best friends.” William “Mack” Knight Emma and William, a tech entrepreneur who worked in Silicon Valley, dated between 2015 and 2017, keeping the relationship low key. In her March 2017 cover story for Vanity Fair, Emma explained why she wouldn't speak publicly about her boyfriend. “I want to be consistent: I can't talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home,” she said. “You can't have it both ways. I've noticed, in Hollywood, who you're dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act.”...",2025-07-17 11:56:00,en,WEB,,,,17486441024d7ffafba2a353850f2fb3,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This is a detailed biographical article about Emma Watson's dating history.

mov_88EF8C3D6447E00F13F6AD1CB5BB5AE7,"  KINGSTON, Jamaica—For more than two decades, the lens of videographer Germaine Patrick has captured moments that have entertained, informed, and inspired audiences around the world. From his humble beginnings in Jamaica to coordinating productions for some of the world's most iconic brands, Patrick has carved out a remarkable career as a camera operator and director in the fast-paced world of television production. He was recently promoted to the role of global talent coordinator at the London-based Dreamtek TV, a company which was established in 1999, that specialises in video production, and has offices in New York City, and Singapore. Patrick is the sole Jamaican employed at the company. His journey began after he graduated from high school, where he studied film at the Creative Production and Training Centre (CPTC) on Arnold Road in Kingston. Germaine Patrick He then took his first steps in media working with Hype TV, RE-TV, Television Jamaica and then at Sportsmax. “As a freelancer, I wanted to make a name for myself because I have a sharp eye for visuals and an unrelenting work ethic. This has taken me far beyond the Caribbean shores, as traveling opportunities came along which included the United States, the Caribbean and eventually in Europe. I have also lent my expertise to a diverse range of projects spanning in entertainment, sports, documentaries, corporate content, news and infomercials,” Patrick told Observer Online on Wednesday. He continued, “I always believed in the power of storytelling, no matter the platform or the audience. That belief has brought me across continents and into the heart of some of the world's most dynamic media environments.” Upon migrating to the United Kingdom, his career entered a new chapter. He worked with renowned broadcasters such as CNN London and Warner Bros, further cementing his reputation as a trusted professional in the field. His role at Dreamtek TV marked a significant evolution—not only working behind the camera but also stepping into a leadership role as a production coordinator. Here, he orchestrated complex, global productions for clients like Facebook, Google, Burberry, Spotify, and Bentley, managing logistics, crews, and creative direction with precision. One of the highlights of his career came during the BET Awards in 2008 and 2009, where he worked on the red carpet interviewing legendary figures including Joe Jackson, the father of Michael Jackson, as well as superstars like Beyoncé, Busta Rhymes, P Diddy, Master P, Mariah Carey and Bobby Valentino to name a few. Another highlight was when he covered the MOBO awards in London interviewing the likes of Giggs, Stormzy, Stefflon Don, Skepta, Davido, Wizkid and others. “Those moments were surreal,” he said. “To be face-to-face with icons, capturing their energy and presence—it's something I'll never forget.” Today, Patrick stands as a seasoned industry professional whose journey is a testament to passion, resilience, and vision. His story serves as an inspiration not only to those in the media world but to anyone striving to rise from modest beginnings to international acclaim. As the industry continues to evolve, one thing remains certain: wherever there is a story to tell, Germaine will be there—behind the camera, crafting the narrative. Asked why he decided on a career in the media landscape, Germaine said “From a child I always liked to be creative and have a love for how movies and just videos were created.” He shared that the industry has changed significantly since he got his start, and he has adapted to the changes and the technology that have been introduced in the media. “The industry has evolved massively – technology has changed for the better, cameras have become smaller and more compact and just the overall process for creating videos has become quicker, and access for less expensive equipment is more accessible. The industry is an ever-evolving industry so you will always be learning no matter how many years you have been doing it,” Patrick reasoned.","KINGSTON, Jamaica—For more than two decades, the lens of videographer Germaine Patrick has captured moments that have entertained, informed, and inspired audiences around the world.

n3r9h4c,"  Since you're selling higher end items (that linen-cotton blend says haute couture, but for kids), I'm going to ask the obvious question: how targeted are your ads? You said you're getting a decent amount of traffic, but it's not converting. Are you getting add-to-carts and then the carts getting abandoned? Or not even add-to-cart? If no add-to-cart, then that tells me something is wrong either in the targeting (you're not attracting that high-income parent who wants something they can't find in the big box stores, and is the same level of quality they expect in their own adult clothing), or ... your website isn't telling the story adequately. Or maybe a mixture of both. The other poster already pointed out that you're not justifying the higher cost. Do some competitive research. Just search ""high end children's clothing"" and you'll get back a bunch of really high end children's clothing. I just saw a Burberry 3-item pack for babies that's a playsuit, a dungarees-with-skirt, and a hat for $610 CAD!!!! Look at how they present their items, what they're saying, what they focus on. The Burberry one said it's made with a custom print woven in Italy. That it's imported - from Italy. Italy ... land of fashion (next to France, okay). And that's how they justify that cost. Figure out what *you* can say to that mid-tier buyer (I guess $42 is only mid-range, now that I'm seeing some of the other prices!) that'll be compelling. Just saying it's a cotton-and-linen blend isn't enough. And yes, double check your demographic targeting. You need to be attracting that higher income audience. Someone living paycheck to paycheck may like what the ad says but then they get to the site and the price is too high? Then you shouldn't be targeting those people!","Since you're selling higher end items (that linen-cotton blend says haute couture, but for kids), I'm going to ask the obvious question: how targeted are your ads?

mov_15ABC57FD6B47014C19449CA24309BB8,"  Burberry has said it is “encouraged” by the initial progress from its transformation plan but highlighted that trading conditions remain “challenging”. The London fashion house revealed that retail revenues fell by 6% to £433 million for the 13 weeks to June 28, compared with a year earlier, amid a drag from currency rates. However, it reflected a slowdown in the group's sales decline amid efforts to turn around its fortunes after coming under pressure from weaker luxury spending. Last November, the group launched a £40 million cost-cutting programme after first sinking to a loss. In May, the company announced proposals to cut about 1,700 jobs worldwide over the next two years as part of the shake-up. In its fresh update, Burberry said it has made some progress in its transformation efforts but is still in the “early stages” of the potential turnaround. The company said: “In the first half, we are continuing to prioritise investment and expect to see the impact of our initiatives build as the year progresses.” It pointed towards efforts to simplify its operations and improve productivity in a bid to improve profit margins. In the latest quarter, Burberry said there were improvements across its main regions, amid strong sales of “outerwear and scarves”. Comparable retail sales grew by 1% in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA) as positive local spending helped to offset declines among tourists. Meanwhile, its Americas business reported growth of 4% for the quarter. However, it said sales in Greater China fell 5% for the quarter, while its Asia Pacific division saw a drop of 4%, driven by a “challenging performance in Japan”. Joshua Schulman, chief executive of Burberry, said: “The improvement in our first quarter comparable sales, strength in our core categories, and uptick in brand desirability gives us conviction in the path ahead. “Our autumn 2025 collection is being well received by a broad range of luxury customers as it arrives in stores. “Although the external environment remains challenging and we are still in the early stages of our transformation, we are encouraged by the initial progress we are starting to see.”","Burberry has said it is “encouraged” by the initial progress from its transformation plan but highlighted that trading conditions remain “challenging”.

mov_BE1AB0CBF9ABD24626EB69ED9ACC9CA1,"  Shares in Netflix () were in the red ahead of the US opening after the streaming giant reported a modest beat-and-raise earnings report overnight. For the second quarter, Netflix () saw a 16% increase in revenue, reaching $11.08bn (£8.24bn). Net profit surged by 46%, amounting to $3.1bn. These figures slightly exceeded the company's initial guidance for the period. The company also raised its full-year revenue forecast, now expecting between $44.8bn and $45.2bn, up from a prior range of $43.5bn to $44.5bn. The upward revision was driven by the weakening US dollar relative to other currencies, as well as ""healthy"" member growth and an increase in advertising revenue, Netflix () said in a statement. Netflix () revealed that this would be the second consecutive quarter it would not release specific subscription data updates. “Year-over-year revenue growth was primarily a function of more members, higher subscription pricing and increased ad revenue,” the company said in a statement. However, it warned that “operating margin in the second half of 2025 will be lower than the first half due to higher content amortisation and sales and marketing costs associated with our larger second half slate"". Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (), said: ""Despite the strong numbers, Netflix's () shares pulled back by approximately 1.7% in pre-market trading. Analysts suggested the drop may be attributed to high expectations already priced into the stock, combined with profit-taking and investor caution over the company's premium valuation. ""Better than expected quarterly results and upgraded full-year revenue and cash flow guidance weren't enough to keep investors happy. “Shares in Netflix () fell in pre-market trading following the results even though the company is going from strength to strength. Investors took fright at a few points in the update and locked in some profit after the shares doubled in value over the past 12 months. “Investors didn't like the fact that the core of its upgraded revenue guidance was foreign-exchange related rather than demand-driven. It is benefiting from the weakening US dollar relative to most other currencies. “Full-year margin guidance implies that the uplift in second quarter margins won't carry through to the second-half period. That's because it has some big releases on the schedule, including new series of Stranger Things and Wednesday, and it plans to market them heavily. ""Netflix () is betting that extra marketing spend could lead to a big uplift in customer numbers. This isn't a gamble; it's a calculated ploy that could yield big results. “Member growth already improved more than expected at the end of the second quarter, and advertising-related income looks interesting. “Netflix () plans to spend big bucks to strengthen its advertising sales infrastructure and capabilities. Many investors don't like it when money is going out the door rather than coming in. In reality, Netflix is spending money today to potentially make a lot more money tomorrow. Shares in Uber () were flat in pre-market trading despite its announcement of a partnership to deploy more than 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years as demand for driverless cars kicks into high gear. As part of the partnership, the ride-hailing company is collaborating with Lucid (), the electric vehicle maker, and Nuro (), an autonomous vehicle startup. Under the deal, Uber () will invest $300m in Lucid. Meanwhile, Nuro () will develop the self-driving technology that Lucid () will integrate into vehicles to supply Uber () with robotaxis throughout the duration of the partnership, with Nuro also set to receive a multi-hundred-million-dollar investment. Lucid's () stock surged 36% on Thursday following the announcement. The companies plan to launch the robotaxis in a major US urban hub next year. Over the course of six years starting in 2026, Uber () will acquire and deploy more than 20,000 Lucid () Gravity SUVs, each equipped with Nuro's () autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, according to a statement from the three companies. “We're thrilled to partner with Nuro () and Lucid () on this new robotaxi programme, purpose-built just for the Uber () platform, to safely bring the magic of autonomous driving to more people across the world,” said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a statement. Shares in BP () were higher in early morning trade as the oil major took another step in its strategic pivot back to oil and gas by agreeing to sell its US onshore wind business to LS Power. The wind business operates nine onshore wind energy assets across seven US states, all of which are grid-connected and provide power to customers. The wind farms are all operational and have a combined capacity of 1.7GW, of which BP () owns 1.3GW. After completion of the deal, which is expected before the end of the year, BP Wind Energy will form part of LS Power's subsidiary Clearlight Energy, increasing the North American energy group's operating fleet to about 4.3GW. The move comes as BP () seeks to streamline its business and refocus on its core oil and gas operation. William Lin, BP's () executive vice president for gas and low carbon energy, said: “We have been clear that while low carbon energy has a role to play in a simpler, more focused bp, we will continue to rationalise and optimise our portfolio to generate value. ""The onshore US wind business has great assets and fantastic people, but we have concluded we are no longer the best owners to take it forward."" Coinbase (), the largest US crypto exchange, saw its shares climb as the US House passed two major pieces of legislation designed to bring structure to digital asset markets, a move investors interpreted as a step toward long-awaited regulatory clarity. Coinbase's () shares gained 3.2% during the session, closing above $410 for the first time, pushing the company's market cap above $100bn. The stock further increased in pre-market trading, reaching $418. This surge came after the House passed the Clarity Act, which addresses crypto market structure oversight, and the Genius Act, which lays out a framework for regulating stablecoins. The stablecoin bill, which already cleared the Senate last month, is now poised for potential signing into law. Coinbase (), which offers futures trading in the US and spot and perpetual futures products outside the US, stands to benefit significantly from the passage of these bills. “It's really urgent for us to get it settled so that investors can invest in the sector, and that tokens that are issued can be traded on our platform,” Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase's () chief policy officer, said on Wednesday. The stablecoin market, currently valued around $240bn, is projected to see substantial growth, with some high-end estimates forecasting a market size of $1tn or more in the coming years. Coinbase () also holds a stake in Circle (), the largest US stablecoin issuer. Bitcoin () was up by 1% to $119,852 at the time of writing.

mov_3646B801BB45F9A22A7596CD115B8860,"  Shoppers snapping up Burberry wellies, scarves and light jackets to wear at music festivals have helped the fashion brand to its best sales performance in 18 months despite lacklustre spending by tourists around the world. Sales of the luxury British brand fell 2% to £433m in the three months to the end of June, with a 1% decline at established stores, an improvement from the 6% fall in the previous quarter and the best performance since Christmas 2023. Shares in Burberry rose more than 4% on Friday morning on the better-than-expected performance, as Joshua Schulman, who was appointed a year ago, attempts a turnaround. Sales rose in Europe and the Americas but continued to fall in Asia, including its all-important Chinese market, which accounts for 30% of sales. Schulman, the former boss of the US fashion brand Coach, said: “Its a tough macro [environment] out there and we are taking things step by step but we are optimistic about the quarters ahead and the business in general.” He said the company had appealed to “elite VIP” customers with events linked to its partnership with King Charles's Highgrove estate and also to a younger luxury customer through festival-linked pop-ups featuring DJ sets located in shopping centres. A trial of dedicated “scarf bars” within stores have also gone well and the company plans to install 200 in total. “We are appealing to a much broader range of luxury consumers,” he said. Adam Cochrane, an analyst at Deutsche, said further growth was largely dependent on Burberry's ability to “replicate the success” of its core products in other areas. The company said it was “still in the early stages of our turnaround” with aims to continue simplifying the business and improving productivity and cashflow. It expects to achieve £80m of its planned £100m cost cuts this financial year, with the remainder next year, and has already reorganised the business under four regional heads. The company said in May it was cutting up to 1,700 jobs, including an entire shift at its Yorkshire raincoat factory, in an effort to make £60m in cost savings on top of a £40m savings programme announced in November. Schulman said Burberry's autumn ranges were being “well received”, although the external environment “remains challenging. Over the past year, we have moved from stabilising the business to driving Burberry forward with confidence. “The improvement in our first quarter comparable sales, strength in our core categories, and uptick in brand desirability gives us conviction in the path ahead,” he said. He called on the UK government to implement policies that would “encourage tourism” as he said: “International consumers are not shopping in the UK to the extent we would like due to the lack of a VAT refund scheme.” The scheme was phased out under the last government. “All luxury brands and all retail brands would benefit from that,” he said.","Shoppers snapping up Burberry wellies, scarves and light jackets to wear at music festivals have helped the fashion brand to its best sales performance in 18 months despite lacklustre spending by tourists around the world.

Schulman, the former boss of the US fashion brand Coach, said: “Its a tough macro [environment] out there and we are taking things step by step but we are optimistic about the quarters ahead and the business in general.” He said the company had appealed to “elite VIP” customers with events linked to its partnership with King Charles's Highgrove estate and also to a younger luxury customer through festival-linked pop-ups featuring DJ sets located in shopping centres. A trial of dedicated “scarf bars” within stores have also gone well and the company plans to install 200 in total. “We are appealing to a much broader range of luxury consumers,” he said. Adam Cochrane, an analyst at Deutsche, said further growth was largely dependent on Burberry's ability to “replicate the success” of its core products in other areas. The company said it was “still in the early stages of our turnaround” with aims to continue simplifying the business and improving productivity and cashflow. It expects to achieve £80m of its planned £100m cost cuts this financial year, with the remainder next year, and has already reorganised the business under four regional heads. The company said in May it was cutting up to 1,700 jobs, including an entire shift at its Yorkshire raincoat factory, in an effort to make £60m in cost savings on top of a £40m savings programme announced in November. Schulman said Burberry's autumn ranges were being “well received”, although the external environment “remains challenging. Over the past year, we have moved from stabilising the business to driving Burberry forward with confidence. “The improvement in our first quarter comparable sales, strength in our core categories, and uptick in brand desirability gives us conviction in the path ahead,” he said. He called on the UK government to implement policies that would “encourage tourism” as he said: “International consumers are not shopping in the UK to the extent we would like due to the lack of a VAT refund scheme.” The scheme was phased out under the last government. “All luxury brands and all retail brands would benefit from that,” he said.",2025-07-18 09:43:29,en,WEB,,,,40b32a531cf3e5f0960db57631ed3d54,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This is a legitimate news article/financial report about Burberry's recent sales performance, not promotional content.

mov_37764299A52220A45F288AA2903B28F8,"  Burberry has said it is “encouraged” by the initial progress from its transformation plan but highlighted that trading conditions remain “challenging”. The London fashion house revealed that retail revenues fell by 6% to £433 million for the 13 weeks to June 28, compared with a year earlier, amid a drag from currency rates. However, it reflected a slowdown in the group's sales decline amid efforts to turn around its fortunes after coming under pressure from weaker luxury spending. Last November, the group launched a £40 million cost-cutting programme after first sinking to a loss. In May, the company announced proposals to cut about 1,700 jobs worldwide over the next two years as part of the shake-up. In its fresh update, Burberry said it has made some progress in its transformation efforts but is still in the “early stages” of the potential turnaround. The company said: “In the first half, we are continuing to prioritise investment and expect to see the impact of our initiatives build as the year progresses.” It pointed towards efforts to simplify its operations and improve productivity in a bid to improve profit margins. In the latest quarter, Burberry said there were improvements across its main regions, amid strong sales of “outerwear and scarves”. Comparable retail sales grew by 1% in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA) as positive local spending helped to offset declines among tourists. Meanwhile, its Americas business reported growth of 4% for the quarter. However, it said sales in Greater China fell 5% for the quarter, while its Asia Pacific division saw a drop of 4%, driven by a “challenging performance in Japan”. Joshua Schulman, chief executive of Burberry, said: “The improvement in our first quarter comparable sales, strength in our core categories, and uptick in brand desirability gives us conviction in the path ahead. “Our autumn 2025 collection is being well received by a broad range of luxury customers as it arrives in stores. “Although the external environment remains challenging and we are still in the early stages of our transformation, we are encouraged by the initial progress we are starting to see.” The boss also highlighted that the business was continuing to see weak trading from tourists in London. The firm reiterated recent calls for the Government to consider reintroducing the scheme which allowed foreign visitors to claim back VAT, which was scrapped in 2021. “In the UK we still continue to have international consumers not shopping in the UK to the extent we would do. And that does link to the lack of a VAT refund scheme. “We would like to see changes from the Government which would encourage tourism and shopping, and that is a lever they could pull.” Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: “Having stabilised the business, there is evidence Schulman is beginning to gain some traction with his turnaround effort. “Although sales are still declining, the rate of decline has slowed considerably and by more than the market expected. “The problem is that Burberry is operating against less than favourable market conditions, so it could end up running hard just to stand still. “It was notable to see the business acknowledge the challenging backdrop and its key Chinese market, in particular, remains under pressure.” Shares in Burberry climbed by 6.4% in early trading.","Burberry has said it is “encouraged” by the initial progress from its transformation plan but highlighted that trading conditions remain “challenging”.

The Fashion Inspiration for 'The Gilded Age' Wedding Scene Was the Princess Diana of Her Time  Gladys Russell's show-stopping wedding gown was designed by a worldwide team of artisans—and nodded to a real-life heiress. On the fashion front, Gladys's long-sleeved, rosette-covered wedding gown is straight out of a fairytale, making her less-than-happy ending all the more tragic. So, too, was the opulent guest attire, bridesmaid gowns, and historically accurate suiting worn by the rest of the cast. Naturally, Costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone, who's worked across the show's three seasons, went fully custom for the big wedding scene. Using “a combination of historical research, paintings, and fashion references” as inspiration, she tapped a global village of makers and artisans to bring the vision to life. “Producing the bridesmaid dresses, wedding guests, and clergy took an extraordinary amount of assistant costume designers, shoppers, costumers, makers, milliners, and fitters,” she explains.

mov_D7B716D39D4BE6EDD05139790C9C3D29,"  Sylvanian Families has become embroiled in a legal battle with a TikTok creator who makes comedic videos of the children's toys in dark and debauched storylines. The fluffy creatures, launched in 1985, have become a childhood classic. But the Sylvanian Drama TikTok account sees them acting out adult sketches involving drink, drugs, cheating, violence and even murder. The Japanese maker of the toys, Epoch Company Ltd, filed a copyright infringement case in the US saying the videos are causing ""irreparable injury"" to its reputation. The owner of the TikTok account, Thea Von Engelbrechten, from Ireland, filed a counternotice claiming her works were ""parody"". The skits are such a hit that the account has 2.5 million followers and the videos have racked up 68 million likes. Sylvanian Drama also has accounts on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook. It has partnered with major brands including Marc Jacobs, Burberry, Netflix and Hilton for advertising posts. Sylvanian Families are marketed as ""an adorable range of distinctive animal characters with charming and beautiful homes, furniture and accessories"". They live in stylish houses surrounded by luscious greenery, woodland, a meadow and a river. Characters have names like Freya the Chocolate Rabbit girl, Ambrose the Walnut Squirrel baby and Pino the Latte Cat baby. They usually have wholesome adventures with stories entitled Picnic by the sea, Surprise shopping trip and Ice cream for everyone. 'Insecure people, diet culture, toxic men' But the SylvanianDrama TikTok account sees the creatures in costumes and fake eyelashes, with captions saying things like ""My marriage is falling apart"" and ""My boyfriend won't post me on Instagram"". Court documents filed by Epoch with the Southern District of New York on 4 July and seen by the BBC accuse Ms Von Engelbrechten of infringing the company's copyright without its permission, causing irreparable injury to its goodwill and reputation. The court document states that in , Ms Von Engelbrechten said her inspiration for the storylines came from ""cringey TV shows and early 2000s comedy"". She went on: ""I'm also really inspired by my cats because they are extremely sassy and self-obsessed and can be so cute, but they also have no morals when it comes to killing other animals. I try to embody that with the Sylvanians."" Asked why she thought her videos were so popular she told Fohr: ""Maybe it's because it's coming from the voice of a 22-year-old who struggles with the same things as [they do]. I have a lot of storylines about insecure people, diet culture, toxic men, and sustainability, which I think other girls my age are also thinking a lot about."" A date has been set for 14 August for a pre-trial conference. This is when legal teams from both sides meet to explore settlement options or prepare the case for trial.

mov_522C069372660BD3A2A8A3882BAC10AD,"  The value of the European luxury goods market grew to almost €110 billion in 2024. ""This is the result of several converging factors,"" assesses Rafal Drzewiecki, TikTok's Country Director for Central Europe, in an interview with Euronews. ""The recovery of tourism after the pandemic, attractive exchange rates and the growing importance of emotional consumption. European luxury has become more accessible."" In his opinion, a generational change is playing a key role. New consumers of luxury no longer buy for prestige. They buy for themselves. This is borne out of the popularity of the hashtag #selfgifting, which has seen a 110% increase on TikTok in recent times alone. ""We are seeing an explosion of content in which users celebrate their own achievements by buying themselves a gift,"" said Drzewiecki, adding that ""it's not about demonstrating status, but about pleasure, satisfaction, and self-expression"". Rafał Drzewiecki, Country Director for Central Europe at TikTok in an interview with Euronews - Paweł Głogowski/Euronews Polish luxury conquers the world Against this background, Poland comes off impressively. The domestic luxury goods market grew by as much as 24% year-on-year in 2023 - well above the European average. The fastest growing segments are beauty, fashion and accessories. It is not only global brands that have benefited from the wave of interest in luxury, but also Polish brands with character. TikTok has played no small part in this. An example? Inglot, a well-known cosmetics brand from Przemyśl, which gained a new global audience thanks to its presence on the platform. Local brands have the opportunity to reach an international audience and go beyond the local context thanks to TikTok - Inglot/TikTok ""Brands such as Inglot and Chylak show that a well-told story and authenticity reach an international audience. On TikTok today, they are building communities around values, aesthetics and everyday rituals,"" Drzewiecki told Euronews. In user content - from tutorials to 'get ready with me' - Inglot's products appear on smartphone screens from São Paulo to Seoul. The 9:16 aesthetic has become a natural environment for luxury. Related Luxury without the glitz The new generation expects more than perfect shots. What matters is authenticity. Premium brand campaigns gain popularity when they are real, surprisingly everyday - such as Burberry's clip of The Crown actors making tea. Olivia Colman, odtwórczyni roli królowej Elżbiety II w serialu „The Crown” w kampanii Burberry - (fot. Burberry/TikTok) ""It works because it's human. The consumer today doesn't want advertising - they want relationships,"" Drzewiecki added. This can also be seen in the data. As many as 89% of users say they trust the opinion of influencers more than classic advertising. One in four refrains from making a purchase until they have seen the product from their favourite creator. In contrast, 60% of Polish TikTok users admit that they have been influenced into purchases through content on the platform. TikTok rewards authenticity, meaning content that is honest, human, and sometimes even imperfect is often more successful. - Burberry/TikTok Related TikTok made me buy it The #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt trend has already amassed over 18.5 million videos. This is not a joke, but a conversion path. Today, luxury is not the result of a marketing strategy - it is an emotion, a moment, an aesthetic. ""If a product looks good, tells a story and resonates with the viewer's identity, a purchase decision is made almost immediately,"" Drzewiecki explained. Millennials and Gen Z are more likely to buy products that are reviewed by creators on the platform. - Ellie Delphine/TikTok The luxury of tomorrow is a brand that listens Does luxury have a future? Only if it becomes more accessible, more empathetic and ready to talk. ""The new generation expects authenticity, not perfection, from brands,"" said the director, adding that young people want ""relationships, social engagement, and shared values""....","The value of the European luxury goods market grew to almost €110 billion in 2024. ""This is the result of several converging factors,"" assesses Rafal Drzewiecki, TikTok's Country Director for Central Europe, in an interview with Euronews. ""The recovery of tourism after the pandemic, attractive exchange rates and the growing importance of emotional consumption. European luxury has become more accessible."" In his opinion, a generational change is playing a key role. New consumers of luxury no longer buy for prestige. They buy for themselves. This is borne out of the popularity of the hashtag , which has seen a 110% increase on TikTok in recent times alone. ""We are seeing an explosion of content in which users celebrate their own achievements by buying themselves a gift,"" said Drzewiecki, adding that ""it's not about demonstrating status, but about pleasure, satisfaction, and self-expression"". Rafał Drzewiecki, Country Director for Central Europe at TikTok in an interview with Euronews - Paweł Głogowski/Euronews Polish luxury conquers the world Against this background, Poland comes off impressively.
