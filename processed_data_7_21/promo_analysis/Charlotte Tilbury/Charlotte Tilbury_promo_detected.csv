The brand has rolled out its Summer Icons Beauty Box, offering a rare opportunity to grab some of Charlotte's most adored makeup and skincare essentials at an almost unheard-of 50% discount. Unlike previous mystery boxes where the content was a surprise, this time Charlotte has disclosed every item in advance, so shoppers know exactly what they're investing in. The Summer Icons Beauty Box is a handpicked collection of Charlotte's most sought-after products, including seven full-size icons and a travel-sized Charlotte's Magic Cream, all neatly packed into a luxurious gift box. Valued at $233, it's priced at $116, meaning each item inside average at $14.50 apiece.

Summer Icons Beauty Box Charlotte Tilbury Product Description In Charlotte's Summer Icons Beauty Box, discover the beauty icons you will adore – and not just for summer. Charlotte has curated a mystery box of summer beauty secrets with a magical 50% off, giving everyone, everywhere the secret to a gorgeous glow, all year round. The box also includes the Pillow Talk Eyeliner and Push Up Lashes Mascara Eye Kit for definition and lift without smudging - a summer essential for long, hot days. Rounding out the set is Charlotte's Magic Hydration Revival Cleanser, which dissolves makeup while hydrating the skin, and a travel-size Magic Cream, her top-selling moisturizer that plumps and preps your skin with a radiant finish. Mirror writer Beth reviewed Charlotte's Magic Hydration Revival Cleanser when it launched and said: ""The cleanser effortlessly removed makeup and impurities without stripping my skin of its natural moisture, and after rinsing it off, I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth and clear my skin felt."" However, she did note it had a ""sticky texture"", which she was not a fan of. Charlotte Tilbury isn't the only beauty retailer to embrace the new summer season as Sephora has launched its Vacay All Day Makeup Value Set. Worth $125, the kit costs $50 and includes nine must-haves to keep you hydrated and glowing all summer long. Or there's the Black Honey Makeup Vault Set available at Ulta Beauty. Coming in at $138, the four-piece set includes Clinique's cult-classic shade, plus Pink Honey Almost Lipstick all in a clutch. The Charlotte Tilbury edit is a good opportunity for die-hard fans to replenish their collection, or for newcomers to sample the brand's offerings at a significantly reduced price. The only hitch is that the shades are pre-determined, so they might not be your first choice, but generally, they seem to suit most skin tones without any outlandish colors. Now that all items have been unveiled and the price has been halved, shoppers can check out the Charlotte Tilbury summer set here.","Shoppers can save 50% on Charlotte Tilbury's Summer Icons Beauty Box Shawna Healey and Bethan Shufflebotham Senior Fashion and Beauty Writer This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it.

mov_DBB09078A48717073FC8B4944E3CE46A,"  While Amazon Prime Day may have wrapped up, Charlotte Tilbury's summer sale is still going strong and Irish shoppers can snap up some of the brand's most-loved products at huge discounts - including up to 50% off. One of the standout offers is the return of Charlotte's Mystery Boxes, packed with four full-size makeup and skincare favourites. There are two versions to choose from - 'Pretty Pink and 'Cheeky Peach - each tailored to a specific colour palette. Whether you love a rosey glow or a peachy finish, there's something here to suit your style. Each mystery box normally costs €131, but is now on sale for just €65 - or you can grab the duo for €130 (down from €260) if you want to mix and match. As the name suggests, the exact contents are a surprise - but Charlotte Tilbury has given a few hints. Promo images show silhouettes of what look like lipsticks (€37), blush palettes (€44), mascaras (€32) and possibly a skincare treat. And while shades and formulas are kept secret, everything will stick to either the pink or peach theme - great for summer makeup bags. Irish fans of the brand know these mystery drops tend to sell out fast, and previous versions have included everything from the Beautyverse Palette to Magic Cream minis, making them serious value for money. Elsewhere, LookFantastic's July beauty box - worth over €150 - is currently at €20 and contains products from Molten Brown, Avant, This Works and more. And the Boots' Festival Edit Beauty Bag is €55 and worth €190.95. With the likes of Milk Makeup, Too Faced, Kylie Cosmetics and more inside, it's a real treat that'll help cure any festival blues. While the new Charlotte Tilbury Mystery Boxes are a real treat regardless of what's inside, the only nuisance would be receiving a product that is not quite the right shade for the shopper's skin tone or type. If you'd prefer to know exactly what you're getting, there are plenty of other summer offers worth checking out. The Charlotte's Summer Icons Box is down to €117 from €235 and includes seven full-sized favourites, including the Matte Beauty Blush Wand, Pillow Talk eyeliner, Push Up Lashes mascara and a travel-sized Magic Cream. There's also the Hollywood Flawless Filter and Airbrush Flawless Foundation Duo for €52 (usually €104) - a cult combo beloved by makeup artists and influencers alike. Charlotte Tilbury's international shipping means Irish beauty lovers won't miss out, and delivery is available across the country for €3.95 - or free on orders over €59. Whether you're topping up your makeup bag or trying something new, this is a chance to bag luxury products at a fraction of the price.

mov_036EC18E7ACB83CA458E68138F9C7EB3,"  Balmy evenings call for a touch of golden-hour glamour – AVA WELSING-KITCHER shares 5 must-try makeup hacks for just the right amount of afterglow Go bold with your bronzer Going big on bronzer is a classic vacation look for a reason. Start with an understated formula, such as Charlotte Tilbury's Beautiful Skin Sun-Kissed Glow Bronzer, adding a fingerprint-sized amount inside the hollows of your cheeks, along your jawline and across your chin and temples. For a matte take, add a touch more across your eyelids and the bridge of your nose, before blending everything out with your fingertips. If a spot of shimmer is more your thing, swipe Westman Atelier's Lit Up Highlight Stick in Brûlée where you'd normally apply blusher, starting on the cheeks, just below your hairline and on the bridge of your nose and eyelids. Finish with a bold lip – there's nothing quite like a vibrant coral or crimson shade against bronzed skin to make your skin pop; Gucci Beauty's Odalie Red and Westman Atelier's Le Rouge are both worthy vacation wins. Look to molten eyes Matte eyeshadow and cat-eye liner are just too much on a balmy night – instead, look to metallic finishes that are easily blended with a fingertip should they settle into creases. Hourglass's Eyeshadow Stick in Solstice, a shimmery bronze, sets in mere minutes, so work quickly and on one eye at a time. You can then top lids with a powder metallic eyeshadow in a similar shade, or add a contrasting tone to transform it. Try Sisley's Les Phyto-Ombres Eyeshadow in Sparkling Topaz for a universally flattering copper finish while Charlotte Tilbury's Luxury Palette in Pillow Talk has all your vacation-ready shades in one. To complement the look, swipe a couple of fingers across your chosen shade and mix with a body oil in your hands to pick the hues out across limbs and décolletage; finish with fresh skin and lashings of brown mascara to keep everything soft yet defined. Dial down the base For perfect holiday skin, look for light textures (akin to moisturizers and serums) that offer slight coverage rather than a full on foundation. Charlotte Tilbury's Hollywood Flawless Filter has become a cult product for good reason: its hybrid formula combines the coverage of a tinted serum, the luminosity of a highlighter and the prepping power of a primer to deliver a softly diffused finish. Spot-conceal any blemishes or dark under-eye areas, then add a touch of Sisley's Blur Expert Powder to patches prone to sweat or oiliness. Glow head to toe Make the most of your new tan by adding luminosity to your body care, too, locking in moisture straight out of the shower with a few drops of 111Skin's Rose Gold Radiance Booster mixed into Dr. Barbara Sturm's Super Anti-Aging Body Serum – a beautifully hydrating formula that feels nearly invisible on skin. For extra shine, add the luminizing drops to a body oil – such as Augustinus Bader's velvety formula – instead. Then finish with a full-watt effect by running Hourglass's Vanish Flash Highlighting Stick in Champagne Flash – a luminous gold – or Westman Atelier's Lit Up Highlight Stick in Nectar – a radiant golden-peach – along your shins, collarbones and shoulders before hitting the beach bar. Super-boost your blush If you're sunburnt, you may want to sit this one out, but otherwise, amplify that healthy vacation flush while it lasts with a hit of blusher. Our tip? Opt for warm tones over cool: coral, rosy pink, peach or terracotta work at different intensities across all skin tones. Westman Atelier's Blush Stick in Minette is the perfect suits-all coral, with its melt-in formula for easy reapplication – well worth popping into your clutch for the night. For something punchier, try Clé de Peau Beauté's Cream Blush in Pale Fig, a vivid rose, that truly brings out the warmth in freshly tanned skin. Powder formulas work just as well when layered into skin. We love Hermès Beauty's Rose Hermès Silky Blush Powder in Rose Tan, a golden pink. Press the cream formula onto your complexion straight from the stick or dab the powder with a damp makeup sponge first and take it across cheeks, temples, eyelids and the bridge of your nose to mimic a natural sun flush, before swiping across your lips and adding a balm.

These new tinted lip oils feel like a lip gloss and oil hybrid. They're slick, high-shine and somehow not sticky at all, which makes them ideal for those who don't typically like a lip gloss, but want gleaming, shiny lips. The new lip oil comes in six ""juicylicious"" colors: Pink Watermelon, Strawberry Vanilla, Coconut Water, Cherry Glaze, Pure Peach and Candy Fig. As the names suggest, each oil smells just like its matching fruit essence. Packed with moisturizing hyaluronic acid microspheres and vitamin E, these new Nectar Oils don't just look good on, they also work to plump and hydrate your pout. I got my hands on two shades ahead of the launch (Cherry Glaze and Pure Peach) and can't seem to put them down. Since they have an oil-based formula, they glide on and stay put without that sticky feeling. The colors are subtle and buildable, and the easy-glide gel applicator makes swiping them on a breeze. If you loved the iconic Juicy Tubes from the past, you're sure to be obsessed with these.","Launch date: July 10 It's time to get juicy this summer with Charlotte Tilbury's new Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oils.

The Nip+Fab Jelly Patches are formulated with hyaluronic acid to hydrate skin and reduce dryness instantly, tremella (also known as snow mushroom) to tackle fine lines and wrinkles, and polyglutamic acid which holds four times more water than hyaluronic acid. Elsewhere on Charlotte Tilbury, the Hollywood Skin Secrets Immediate Eye Revival Patches, £58, are packed with Bio-Smooth Eye Contour Complex to depuff and hydrate under-eyes in 10 minutes. ESPA Isotonic Hydra Gel Eye Masks are formulated with minerals, antioxidants and natural extracts that help plump, brighten, and soothe tired eyes. Shoppers can get them at Next, where they cost £36.50. Ruth explained that the jelly patches made her fall in love with Nip+Fab and she has even partnered with the brand to test out other products. In a recent post on Instagram, she said: ""I just want to talk to you about this Nip+Fab, I was introduced to this brand by my make-up artist who's using this on me. It's lovely, hydrating jelly eye patches that you might have seen me, on Instagram, the bright green ones under my eyes."" The jelly patches have also gained approval from shoppers on Amazon, earning them an overall 4.4 out of five average star-rating. One said: ""I have super sensitive eyes and wear contact lenses and these don't cause any irritation or stinging, even if very close to the waterline."" A second shared her tip: ""I pop these right at the back of my fridge so they are extra cold, once on they stay cold for at least 20 plus minutes they are also thick but not too thick unlike others I've used are really thin and slip off, my eyes feel refreshed after using these."" However, one questioned the efficacy of the patches and penned: ""Still early days they seem to leave my under eye feeling smooth, however I could only really lie down when applied as they just slide down your face, which if you're busy and multi-tasking, it isn't great."" Another said the masks aren't 'particularly hydrating' and 'slide significantly'. But someone else added: ""Love these eye patches. Really hydrating for under eye skin and smoothes out those fine lines.""
