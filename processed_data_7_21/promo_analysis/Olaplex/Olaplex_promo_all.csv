EAF08F5EC939AAFE9B96F88DE3FB95CB,"  MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage (I charge from £1,150 for mine). Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 (£19.55, www.amazon.co.uk), Olaplex No.8 (£22.40, www.sephora.co.uk) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer (£21, www.boots.com). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner (£27, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner (£26, www.harrods.com). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now £17.99, sha op.toni www.ndguy.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now £12, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo (£24.50, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment (£25). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

mov_6C64DD084F0504F6AD6C1CDB13175417,"  The age-old question when it comes to haircare is: why isn't my hair doing what I want? Getting your locks to look their best can often be a struggle, especially if you have textured, coloured or damaged hair, as so many of us do. Often, it's the products we think are helping our hair that are actually harming it, so, it's time to reach for the best sulphate-free shampoos. Sulphates are the chemicals and ingredients added to shampoos that give you that clean-hair feeling. They remove dirt, grease and other impurities, and create that bubbly lather we all know and love. However, they can also strip hair of its natural oil and moisture, leaving it more brittle, lifeless and likely to shed or snap. So, what do we do? Well, the good news is sulphate-free shampoos are gradually becoming the norm, providing nourishing alternatives that can cleanse your hair and scalp without being too harsh. I spoke to Emma Vickery, art director at Percy and Reed, who's spent most of her career obsessing over how we should look after our hair. “Products are far more gentle and kind to the hair and skin without sulphates – any other good ingredients in the formulations are now no longer compromised by being intermixed with them,” says Vickery. As for finding the right product for your particular locks, I've put a whole range of formulas through their paces. No matter what you're looking for – from frizz-fighting to colour protection – you're sure to find the best sulphate-free shampoo for you in this round-up. How I tested the best sulphate-free shampoos Trying out a wide range of sulphate-free shampoos – from luxury salon-style buys to budget-friendly brands – I have never looked at my hair so closely before, making sure to take note of even the slightest changes. This started by making sure I kept the rest of my haircare routine the same, so any changes could be attributed to the new shampoo. When testing, I considered key factors such as: Ease of use: I looked at how effortlessly each product lathered (despite the absence of sulphates), how simple it was to rinse out, and whether the packaging was practical and user-friendly. Shampoos that required excessive effort to distribute evenly or left behind residue were marked down, while those that provided a smooth, intuitive washing experience stood out. Scent: While personal preference varies, I prioritised shampoos with pleasant fragrances that didn't overpower or linger too long after rinsing. Since sulphate-free formulas often rely on more natural ingredients, I also noted whether the scent felt clean and fresh or overly artificial. Results: The final look and feel of the hair were central to testing. I assessed how each product left the hair after washing – looking for softness, shine, manageability, and overall health. Shampoos that made hair feel clean but not stripped, smooth but not weighed down, ranked highest. I also noted improvements in frizz control, curl definition, or volume where relevant. Why you can trust IndyBest reviews has been writing product reviews for IndyBest since 2023, covering a wide range of topics, from the best cleansers to the best body wash. In order to bring you only the very best, Ella rigorously tests products, from bargain buys to designer picks, offering her honest opinions and highlighting products that work as they should. The best sulphate-free shampoos for 2025 are: Best sulphate-free shampoo overall – Umberto Giannini curl jelly wash: £8.95, Lookfantastic.com Best budget sulphate-free shampoo – Faith in Nature shampoo bar, lavender and geranium: £5.25, Hollandandbarrett.com Best sulphate-free shampoo for damaged hair – Olaplex no.4 bond maintenance shampoo: £22.40, Amazon.co.uk Best frizz-fighting shampoo – Living proof frizz shampoo: £29, Livingproof.co.uk Best science-powered shampoo – Act + Acre cold processed stem cell shampoo: £40, Actandacre.co.uk Best sulphate-free shampoo for a clean feel – Kevin Murphy scalp spa wash: £29, Kevinmurphystore.com Sulphate-free shampoo FAQs What is the best sulphate-free shampoo? I can not recommend enough the defining, frizz-fighting and softening benefits of Umberto Giannini's curl jelly wash to anyone with a slight texture or curl to their mane – thank me later, is all I have to say. Meanwhile, the Olaplex no.4 bond maintenance shampoo gave me soft, shiny, defined curls and lots of compliments. Close behind is Living Proof's frizz shampoo, as it did exactly as it said on the tin, defeating any frizz in sight and leaving me with a gorgeous scent I'll keep coming back for. I was also blown away by the capabilities and natural ingredients of Sukin's natural balance shampoo, especially as the size is so generous for the price. What are sulphates? Essentially, sulphates are chemicals used as a cleaning agent in products such as shampoo, shaving gel and shower wash. It's what causes the foam when washing your hair, which, for most people, tells them it's doing its job of removing dirt. But, for certain types of hair – such as curly hair – using sulphates can be damaging, and it can even cause skin irritation for some. What does a sulphate-free shampoo actually do? This type of shampoo works much like any other regular formula but the ingredient list is where you'll find the most differences, due to the lack of sulphates. While they might sound harmless, sulphate ingredients can cause the scalp's natural oils, which help to keep strands healthy, to be stripped away, and they can even cause some skin irritation. Is sulphate-free shampoo good for hair? Some people prefer their shampoo to be foamy, in which case sulphate-free shampoo might not be for you. However, there are a lot of benefits to be had from staying clear of this chemical, such as reducing frizz and scalp irritation, as well as leaving hair softer and better conditioned, while it can also help curly hair stay intact....","The age-old question when it comes to haircare is: why isn't my hair doing what I want?

Y lo hace con fuerza. El Amla en Polvo Orgánico, usado durante siglos en la medicina ayurvédica, ha regresado con el poder de una tendencia pero con la solidez de una tradición. Este polvo vegetal, derivado del fruto indio Phyllanthus emblica, está conquistando rituales de cuidado natural por su capacidad real de transformar tanto el cabello como la piel. Y ahora está por solo 14 euros en Amazon durante Prime Day, sin marketing excesivo, sin fórmulas vacías. Solo naturaleza en su forma más pura. La versatilidad del Amla es parte de su atractivo. Como mascarilla capilar, fortalece la raíz, frena la caída, estimula el crecimiento y da ese efecto de volumen sano que no depende de siliconas ni ceras sintéticas. Es ideal para cabellos debilitados, teñidos o simplemente cansados de procesos químicos. En una época donde muchas fórmulas capilares prometen pero no cumplen, el Amla actúa con constancia, no con promesas mágicas. Basta con mezclarlo con agua tibia hasta formar una pasta y aplicarlo en cuero cabelludo y largos. El resultado no es inmediato como con un sérum con siliconas, pero sí profundo. El cabello se siente más fuerte, más denso y con una textura que recuerda al pelo virgen: grueso, brillante y con vida propia. El blush rosad de 3 euros que deja efecto Rare Beauty perfecto y sin gastar de más     El fijador de maquillaje viral de Amazon que revive delineadores y ahorra maquillaje     Rizos sin frizz, sin rigidez y con brillo: sí, existe, se llama Olaplex en Amazon ¿Y en la piel? También hay magia. Aplicado como mascarilla facial (mezclado con yogur natural o miel), el Amla ilumina, desinflama y ayuda a igualar el tono. Su alta concentración de vitamina C, antioxidantes y taninos ayuda a reducir manchas, cerrar poros y aportar esa luminosidad natural que no se logra con iluminadores. No pica, no arde, no irrita, y es perfecto para pieles mixtas o grasas que necesitan limpieza profunda sin agresión. Otro punto a favor es su pureza: sin conservantes, sin perfumes, sin ingredientes extraños. Este es uno de esos productos que entiendes con solo leer el empaque. Viene en formato de 200 gramos, lo que alcanza para múltiples aplicaciones tanto capilares como faciales. ¿Por qué importa tanto el regreso de ingredientes como el Amla? Porque, en medio de una industria obsesionada con lo nuevo, lo ancestral regresa con la fuerza de lo que ha sido probado durante siglos. Porque hay algo profundamente honesto en usar un fruto molido como mascarilla. Porque no todo necesita oler a mango artificial ni prometer “piel de filtro” para ser efectivo. El Amla en Polvo Orgánico no es tendencia, es permanencia. Su valor no está solo en sus propiedades, sino en cómo nos conecta con una belleza más consciente, más lenta y más real. Por 14 euros en Amazon por Prime Day, es una inversión natural y poderosa en ti. Porque a veces, menos ciencia cosmética y más sabiduría vegetal es justo lo que tu rutina estaba esperando. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]En un mundo donde las rutinas de belleza se inundan de activos sintéticos y nombres que suenan más a laboratorio que a cuidado personal, la sabiduría ancestral vuelve a abrirse camino.

397059B84031EE2F45D751CA8833E1A2,"  by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage. Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 ((EURO)29.50, www.brownthomas.com), Olaplex No.8 ((EURO)29.50, www.arnotts.ie) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer ((EURO)24.45, www.lookfantastic.ie). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner ((EURO)31, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner ((EURO)30, www.boots.ie). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now (EURO)22.49, www.cloud10beauty.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now (EURO)14, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo ((EURO)28.20, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment ((EURO)28). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

1m2a668,"  Hello! I've been interested in FFF for a while, so my friend sent me a sample box. I've been waiting soooo excitedly and today it showed up and it was a huge disappointment.

n48ujra,"  Yesyesyes! I love them and their hair. I am trying to bring it back. Everyone does the platinum these days and it's too much. And you can toooootally do it yourself. PLUS it will save you like $500 to DIY. The real trick isn't so much the coloring, but the foiling. You can google pro foiling images that show you the angle and the lines. But if you aren't confident in that part of it, you can always do the other stuff yourself, then book a stylist for the foil (highlights), and finish the root smudge yourself. Honestly, I use the same tools and such at home on myself that I do in the salon and the basic brushes/cups and stuff are not that expensive. If you plan on ever doing your hair yourself more than once, it is absolutely worth it. I use Framar brushes and cups. You can find them on Amazon. And if your hair is suffering after all that, you can get Olaplex online for a deep conditioning (salons will charge a LOT for the same thing).","Yesyesyes! I love them and their hair. I am trying to bring it back. Everyone does the platinum these days and it's too much. And you can toooootally do it yourself. PLUS it will save you like $500 to DIY. The real trick isn't so much the coloring, but the foiling. You can google pro foiling images that show you the angle and the lines. But if you aren't confident in that part of it, you can always do the other stuff yourself, then book a stylist for the foil (highlights), and finish the root smudge yourself. Honestly, I use the same tools and such at home on myself that I do in the salon and the basic brushes/cups and stuff are not that expensive.
