mov_107E4EB1AF0A716F45690800785062D9,"  This post will show you the 20 must-have travel essentials to upgrade any trip. POV: you packed these 20 travel must-haves and had the best trip ever. Whether you're an avid traveler or traveling for the very first time, packing the right items can make or break your trip. And regardless of your frequent flyer status, we could all use a refresher when it comes time to pack our bags. As someone who travels frequently, I won't leave home without these 20 items that level up my travels. They are my absolute must-haves that make my trips more comfortable, more entertaining, and all around more enjoyable. No gatekeeping here! So before you catch that flight (or train, car, or boat ride), make sure you bring these essentials with you, and thank yourself later. Passport Holder If you're leaving the country, you will need a passport! This is one of the most important, if not the most important, items you will be carrying with you, so be sure to keep yours protected and in good condition by keeping it in a case. Mark & Graham Leather Personalized $49 AT MARK & GRAHAM A personalized passport case is just so chic. It will make you look and feel like a jet-setter, regardless of how much you actually travel. This faux leather passport case comes in 12 different colors and can be customized with a foil debossed or printed monogram for a personal touch. P.S. — it also makes for a thoughtful gift! RFID $13.99 AT AMAZON Not only is this passport holder super cute, affordable, and available in more than 30 different colors and prints, but it has an RFID blocking shield material inside to protect your sensitive information from potential data theft. It doesn't just hold your passport, but it also has convenient card slots that are great for storing your ID card, credit card, tickets, boarding passes, and more, plus a snap button closure to keep it all secure. BÉIS Passport & Luggage Tag $58 AT BÉIS TRAVEL BÉIS is one of the most stylish travel brands out there, so it's no su But whether or not you have a BÉIS suitcase, this set is perfect for anyone, and it can even be personalized with your initials should you choose. The passport holder and luggage tag come in a bonus clear pouch too, which is excellent for stashing your last-minute essentials and/or liquids. Travel Wallet Keep your bank cards and money secure in a functional wallet that is good for taking on the go. Compact Bifold RFID Blocking $11.99 AT AMAZON This compact bifold wallet is slim and lightweight, with compartments for cards, cash, and coins, and should be able to fit in most handbags. Most importantly, it features RFID blocking technology to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized scans. Unfortunately, pickpockets are not the only kind of thieves you need to be cautious of when traveling. The information on your payment cards can be stolen wirelessly via RFID skimming, which is why using a RFID blocking wallet is a smart way to protect your data—especially when you're far away from home. With a ton of different colors to choose from and a budget-friendly price tag, it's a great option. Zippered Passport $35 AT CALPAK Keep your passport secure along with your cards and cash in this durable travel wallet with a zipper closure. It has RFID protection lining and a protective laminate coating on the exterior to withstand travel wear. Headphones From watching Netflix to listening to your favorite music playlists, you can't forget to bring your own headphones. It will make your travel day way more enjoyable! Beats Solo 4 Wireless Bluetooth $97.99 AT AMAZON These on-ear headphones work wirelessly via Bluetooth, so no need to plug any cords into your phone, tablet, or laptop in order to tune in. They have been designed for comfort, with a lightweight, stylish design and adjustable ear cups for a stable fit. Best of all, they only require 10 minutes for five hours of playback time, so if you forgot to charge them ahead of time, you can always quickly plug in at the airport before boarding your flight. Beats Studio Buds Noise-Cancelling $89.99 AT BEST BUY Wish you could block out the sounds of your fellow passengers? You can with the Beats Studio Buds, which feature noise-cancelling technology in a pocketable design. These earbuds are also sweat and water-resistant, so you can throw them in your beach or pool bag worry-free, and they are wireless, so you won't be bothered untangling cords, either. Lip Balm What could be worse than being stuck on a long flight, drive, or train ride with dry, chapped lips? This must-have item can be easily forgotten and left behind, but I'm here to remind you not to make that mistake! Summer Fridays Lip Butter $24 AT SEPHORA This is a viral hit for a reason! Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm is loved for its hydrating properties, healthy-looking shine, and fun flavors and hues to pick from. The balm's formula delivers soothing moisture to parched lips instantly and supports the lips' barrier, which is especially important if you're flying, since being up in the air can be super drying. Glossier Balm Dotcom $16 AT SEPHORA I love a multi-tasking product, and Glossier's Balm Dotcom in the Original clear shade can be used everywhere from your lips to your cuticles and elbows. It is both a lip balm and dry skin salve filled with antioxidants and nourishing emollients that make it a must-have for your travel bag. Books, Magazines, and/or An $159.99 AT AMAZON Vacation is the perfect time to get your reading in, whether it's while on the beach or on the way there (or both). Long plane rides can *fly* by when you're reading a good book! That's why I never travel without a book, magazine, and/or an E-reader (like an Amazon Kindle) which can hold tons of books in one slim package. The Amazon Kindle Paperwhite, which is the newest version, is ultra-thin, offers a glare-free screen, and is waterproof, so you can bring it with you to the beach or pool worry-free....","This post will show you the 20 must-have travel essentials to upgrade any trip.
