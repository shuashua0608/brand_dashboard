A Milan Court has put Loro Piana into a judicial administration procedure concerning alleged worker exploitation in the Italian luxury brand's supply chain. Loro Piana in a statement on Monday evening said it “acknowledges the notification received from the Court of Milan's Preventive Measure Section today regarding labor practices by undisclosed and unauthorized subcontractors of one of its suppliers.” The Italian luxury company stated that “in breach of its legal and contractual obligations, the supplier did not inform Loro Piana of the existence of these subcontractors. Loro Piana was made aware of this situation on May 20, and, as a result, the maison terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours.” Furthermore, “Loro Piana firmly condemns any illegal practices and reaffirms its unwavering commitment to upholding human rights and compliance with all applicable regulations throughout its supply chain. Loro Piana is committed to ensuring that all its suppliers comply with the maison's highest quality and ethical standards in line with its Code of Conduct. In this perspective, Loro Piana has been constantly reviewing and will continue to strengthen its control and audit activities.” According to media reports, Loro Piana sells cashmere jackets with a price tag of 3,000 euros, which, through its subcontractors, would allegedly actually cost only 100 euros. The firm denied this claim. “The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier, nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.” Looking ahead, Loro Piana concluded by stating that it “expresses its full willingness to cooperate with the relevant authorities on this matter and intends to provide the utmost support for any further investigations.” Loro Piana is controlled by the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and is helmed by chief executive officer Frédéric Arnault, who succeeded Damian Bertrand last month. Bertrand is now chairman of the brand and has moved to become deputy CEO of Louis Vuitton. This is only the latest luxury brand to incur in such a probe. Dior, also part of LVMH, and the Giorgio Armani Group have also been investigated for allegedly using suppliers who subjected workers to poor conditions, including inadequate wages, and potentially misleading consumers about their commitment to ethical standards, labor practices and artisanal production. Both brands have seen the judicial administration procedures lifted after taking steps to improve their supply chain and labor practices. In February, a Milan court ordered the revocation of the judicial administration imposed since April last year on Giorgio Armani Operations, a unit of the namesake designer's fashion group, over the labor practices of its Chinese-owned subcontractors. At the time, the Armani Group said in a statement that the decision to revoke the judicial administration was made because the company has taken all the necessary corrective action and “already had a structured and tested system of controls and protection of its supply chain.” The revocation came ahead of the one-year deadline initially expected, it pointed out. The statement underscored that the decision was also made because the court recognized the group's craftsmanship as Armani's suppliers “are often to be identified as highly qualified artisans, especially regarding Italian production, characterized by the highest level of sophistication and quality.” Last year, judges also placed an Italian subsidiary of Dior, which produced handbags for the French brand, under the same form of special administration, again for lack of control over its supply chain. In May, the French fashion house was cleared of any wrongdoing and said it remains “committed to upholding our values of transparency and respect throughout our supply chain. This further underscores the maison's steadfast and historic dedication to pursuing both rigorous Made in Italy products and the highest standards of ethics and excellence.” Alviero Martini was also investigated over alleged worker exploitation, and in May, a unit of Valentino specialized in bags was placed under judicial administration for a year by the Milan court after worker abuse was uncovered at subcontractors. Following the move, Valentino said it had intensified its supplier evaluation process across its supply chain in recent years and would cooperate with the relevant authorities to “fully understand the circumstances that have led to the measures taken by the judiciary in this specific case.”","Referring to ""undisclosed and unauthorized subcontractors of one of its suppliers,"" the Italian luxury company stated that ""in breach of its legal and contractual obligations, the supplier did not inform Loro Piana of the existence of these subcontractors.""

Loro Piana is committed to ensuring that all its suppliers comply with the maison's highest quality and ethical standards in line with its Code of Conduct. In this perspective, Loro Piana has been constantly reviewing and will continue to strengthen its control and audit activities.” According to media reports, Loro Piana sells cashmere jackets with a price tag of 3,000 euros, which, through its subcontractors, would allegedly actually cost only 100 euros. The firm denied this claim. “The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier, nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.” Looking ahead, Loro Piana concluded by stating that it “expresses its full willingness to cooperate with the relevant authorities on this matter and intends to provide the utmost support for any further investigations.” Loro Piana is controlled by the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and is helmed by chief executive officer Frédéric Arnault, who succeeded Damian Bertrand last month. Bertrand is now chairman of the brand and has moved to become deputy CEO of Louis Vuitton. This is only the latest luxury brand to incur in such a probe. Dior, also part of LVMH, and the Giorgio Armani Group have also been investigated for allegedly using suppliers who subjected workers to poor conditions, including inadequate wages, and potentially misleading consumers about their commitment to ethical standards, labor practices and artisanal production. Both brands have seen the judicial administration procedures lifted after taking steps to improve their supply chain and labor practices. In February, a Milan court ordered the revocation of the judicial administration imposed since April last year on Giorgio Armani Operations, a unit of the namesake designer's fashion group, over the labor practices of its Chinese-owned subcontractors. At the time, the Armani Group said in a statement that the decision to revoke the judicial administration was made because the company has taken all the necessary corrective action and “already had a structured and tested system of controls and protection of its supply chain.” The revocation came ahead of the one-year deadline initially expected, it pointed out. The statement underscored that the decision was also made because the court recognized the group's craftsmanship as Armani's suppliers “are often to be identified as highly qualified artisans, especially regarding Italian production, characterized by the highest level of sophistication and quality.” Last year, judges also placed an Italian subsidiary of Dior, which produced handbags for the French brand, under the same form of special administration, again for lack of control over its supply chain. In May, the French fashion house was cleared of any wrongdoing and said it remains “committed to upholding our values of transparency and respect throughout our supply chain. This further underscores the maison's steadfast and historic dedication to pursuing both rigorous Made in Italy products and the highest standards of ethics and excellence.” Alviero Martini was also investigated over alleged worker exploitation, and in May, a unit of Valentino specialized in bags was placed under judicial administration for a year by the Milan court after worker abuse was uncovered at subcontractors. Following the move, Valentino said it had intensified its supplier evaluation process across its supply chain in recent years and would cooperate with the relevant authorities to “fully understand the circumstances that have led to the measures taken by the judiciary in this specific case.”",2025-07-14 19:52:25,en,WEB,,,,1b42ccd1d9a31d810bd25ed89d033540,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This is a detailed news article about labor practices in luxury fashion brands, specifically discussing legal investigations into Loro Piana, Giorgio Armani, Dior, and other Italian luxury brands.

mov_AB34AD1DAD0D80CA6EBDC37C7117EF20,"  In the world of luxury fashion, the “Made in Italy” label has traditionally carried with it a unique prestige. Synonymous with quality, craftsmanship, and tradition, it evokes images of Tuscan leather workshops, master artisans, and time-honored techniques. But a rising number of recent developments suggest that the reality behind the “Made in Italy” moniker is far more complex than the heritage-infused marketing messaging that brands have long relied upon. Just this week, a Milan court placed Loro Piana under judicial administration, raising critical questions about what the “Made in Italy” label actually guarantees in today's fashion economy. Known for its eye-wateringly expensive vicuña knitwear and its white-soled loafers, the LVMH-owned brand joins a growing list of fashion houses placed under judicial oversight by the Milan Tribunal. According to the court's ruling, the “quiet luxury” brand subcontracted garment production to unauthorized workshops accused of labor exploitation and unsafe working conditions. Though Loro Piana is not criminally charged, the court found it had “culpably failed” to monitor its supply chain, effectively prioritizing profit over legal and ethical compliance. This is not an isolated incident. Other brands – including units of Valentino, LVMH-owned Christian Dior, Giorgio Armani, and Alviero Martini – have also come under scrutiny. The court's findings in these cases often point to a recurring issue: unauthorized subcontracting to workshops, many operated by undocumented Chinese laborers within Italy, often under exploitative conditions. A Decade of Exposés & a System Under Strain Labor abuses have been quietly plaguing Italy's fashion manufacturing ecosystem for at least two decades. In 2007, the Italian news program Report aired a now-notorious episode, titled Luxury Slaves, which detailed how high-end Italian products were allegedly being made under sweatshop conditions in factories operated by Chinese immigrants. The program described environments rife with wage violations, unsafe working conditions, and tax evasion. Just months later, the Los Angeles Times published its own investigation, Slaving in the Lap of Luxury, implicating brands like Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, and Prada in a system where Italian labor laws were routinely flouted. Despite a legal minimum wage of over $10 per hour, workers were being paid as little as $5, with many lacking legal documentation and enduring harsh conditions in makeshift factory-lodging hybrids. The backlash to these reports was swift but largely superficial. While the exposés prompted public outcry and some regulatory attention, the underlying systems of clandestine labor persisted. Government raids temporarily shut down noncompliant workshops, and luxury brands issued public statements of concern or denied involvement. However, long-term structural change has proved elusive. The informal economy in cities like Prato continued to flourish, often adapting more quickly than regulators could respond, and sources suggest that many of the same workshops exposed years ago were simply reincarnated under new names or run by associates of shuttered operations. Meanwhile, fashion and mainstream luxury giants' reliance on flexibility, speed, and hefty margins has incentivized outsourcing to third-party suppliers, creating layers of insulation between brands and the labor abuses on which they quietly depend. Reconsidering the Label The implications of these revelations are profound. For consumers, the assumption that “Made in Italy” equates to fair labor, artisanal quality, and ethical production no longer holds unchallenged. For regulators and brands, the label's symbolic weight now comes with increased scrutiny and legal risk. Italy's recent spate of judicial interventions signals a more aggressive stance against abusive subcontracting practices. In May 2025, in a bid to address the systemic nature of these issues, Italian courts, regional authorities, trade unions, and industry groups signed a voluntary agreement to increase supply chain transparency. The pact introduced a centralized supplier registry, transparency certifications, and compliance guidelines, aiming to preempt further court interventions. While it reflects institutional awareness and a willingness to reform, critics argue the agreement lacks legal enforceability, wage protections, and mandatory participation – making it a starting point rather than a structural solution. Until meaningful reforms are enacted, such as tighter oversight of supply chains and more precise legal definitions for origin labeling, “Made in Italy” will continue to function not only as a marketing tool and a smokescreen, but also as a source of potential reputational risk and legal fallout. A Pricing & Positioning Reckoning The reputational impact of these labor scandals extends beyond compliance and into the core economic model of luxury fashion. Brand value and pricing power in this sector depend heavily on perceived authenticity, provenance, and ethical distinction. When the “Made in Italy” designation becomes associated with exploitative labor practices rather than artisanal excellence, the premium that consumers are willing to pay becomes harder to justify. In legal-economic terms, luxury pricing is sustained not simply by input costs or production limitations but by intangible assets – brand equity, consumer trust, and symbolic capital. When these are undermined by judicial findings and media scrutiny, companies may find their market positioning eroded and their pricing strategies increasingly difficult to defend. The risk is twofold: not only do such scandals create reputational damage, but they may also attract regulatory scrutiny under laws governing origin claims, supply chain transparency, and labor protections. To maintain both legal defensibility and economic viability, brands will need to transition from narrative-driven marketing to evidence-based verification. That may involve vertical integration, third-party audits, or legally binding supplier accountability frameworks. In an era of increasing transparency, the sustainability of luxury margins will be determined not just by aesthetics or heritage, but by legal compliance and operational traceability.","In the world of luxury fashion, the “Made in Italy” label has traditionally carried with it a unique prestige.

mov_026238D1CEF98B988283228A8C45E488,"  An Italian court has placed the renowned luxury cashmere brand Loro Piana under judicial administration for a year after an investigation uncovered worker abuse and exploitation in its supply chain. The Court of Milan found that the company “culpably failed” to oversee its suppliers in order to pursue higher profits and cited a wider, systemic pattern of employing subcontractors that violate fair labor practices. Loro Piana is the fifth luxury brand – and the second LVMH-owned brand after Dior – to be found in violation of Italian labor laws since the country began cracking down on subcontracting practices commonly used throughout the industry. Other brands that the court determined have allowed illegal and unethical labor conditions to persist throughout their supply chain include Giorgio Armani, Valentino and handbag company Alviero Martini. This is not just a stain on the reputations of the brands involved but a threat to the entire luxury industry. Bain estimates that about 50% of global luxury goods production is carried out by thousands of small manufacturers in Italy. “Allegations of worker abuse can have a profoundly negative impact on the reputation of a high-end fashion brand,” said Stephen Hahn, chief reputation and strategy officer at RepTrak, a corporate reputation management firm. “Perceptions of workplace is one of the seven key drivers of reputation within the consumer discretionary industry and is especially important to luxury goods,” he continued. Allegations Of Mistreatment The investigation carried out by the Carabinieri police labor protection unit began in May after a worker reported being physically assaulted by his employer, a workshop – more accurately described as a “sweatshop” – that produced Loro Piana men's jackets. The company has since been shut down. Investigators found workers were forced to work up to 90 hours a week, seven days a week and made less than $5 per hour. They also slept in the factory in illegally built rooms. Further investigation found ten workers were employed illegally, seven of whom were undocumented immigrants from China. Complicating the investigation was the fact that Loro Piana didn't contract directly with the offending company but went through two front companies that had no actual manufacturing capability. The front companies subcontracted to several different firms, all of which were rounded up in the investigation. Loro Piana, not parent company LVMH, issued a statement to Fox Business, clarifying that it had not been made aware of the subcontractor relationships. The company emphasized that under both legal and contractual obligations, the company should have been informed of the arrangements. “Loro Piana firmly condemns any illegal practices and reaffirms its unwavering commitment to upholding human rights and compliance with all applicable regulations throughout its supply chain,” the company stated. “Loro Piana is committed to ensuring that all its suppliers comply with the Maison's highest quality and ethical standards in line with its Code of Conduct. In this perspective, Loro Piana has been constantly reviewing and will continue to strengthen its control and audit activities.” However, it appears alleged unethical dealings have been going on for some time, even after many of Italy's fashion brands signed an accord to fight worker exploitation in May. The owner of the subcontractor said the company has been producing between 6,000 and 7,000 men's jackets per year at prices between €118 and €128 ($137 to $149) depending upon the number ordered. Loro Piana cashmere jackets sell for more than $4,000, though the company stated: “The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.” Tangled Web Milan-based visiting international marketing professor at Università Cattolica, Alessandro Balossini Volpe, explained that the luxury fashion supply chain is an increasingly complex network involving multiple manufacturers, raw materials suppliers and numerous contractors and subcontractors, making it increasingly difficult to keep track of. Added to that, the fashion industry is highly volatile with a growing demand for speed in deliveries, constantly revolving collections and diversification of product offerings. “The luxury fashion manufacturing supply chain in Italy is notoriously fragmented,” he explained, with a majority of suppliers being family-run businesses with ten or fewer employees. “Over the last several years, they have been under constant pressure on prices and shrinking volumes, which has put many small players out of business. As a consequence, if a brand has an increasing turnover of suppliers, control over them gets increasingly difficult,” he said, adding “We have a situation of unprecedented complexity in the management of the supply chain.” Tip Of The Iceberg? Balossini Volpe believes that a majority of luxury businesses and brands follow responsible business practices and have been rigorously trying to manage their supply chains. However, “I am also convinced that more than a few players, including some big names, have been chasing profits at all costs, sometimes turning their eyes away from disreputable situations that they could have fixed or changed.” He suggested that the five luxury brands implicated in unethical supply chain practices are not isolated occurrences, but rather the tip of the iceberg in a deeper, systematic failure within the fashion industry. “All of the luxury fashion brands could fall under suspicion of collectively engaging in unethical and unsustainable business practices,” he warned. “It would mean questioning not only the tangible, intrinsic value of the products, but also their intangible value that includes their credibility and integrity,” he concluded.

Zanim pomyślicie o letnich sukienkach i sandałach, zatrzymajcie się na chwilę przy półce z zapachami. Dobrze dobrane perfumy potrafią przenieść was w sam środek letniego wieczoru — nawet jeśli właśnie stoicie w korku na autostradzie. Sprawdźcie trzy zapachy, które pachną jak gorący wieczór we włoskiej Toskanii. Idealne na lato, lekkie, ale zapadające w pamięć. [Perfumy Acqua di Gioia Giorgio Armani – świeżość i lekkość] Ten zapach to kwintesencja letniej świeżości. Jeśli kochacie zapach świeżo ściętej mięty, morskiej bryzy i cytrusowych nut, Acqua di Gioia powinno znaleźć się w waszej kosmetyczce jeszcze przed wyjazdem. Giorgio Armani stworzył perfumy, które pachną jak spacer wzdłuż nadmorskiej promenady o poranku, kiedy powietrze jest jeszcze rześkie, a promienie słońca leniwie budzą się do życia. To idealny wybór na upalne dni — nie przytłacza, a dodaje energii. Dzięki nutom cytryny, mięty i jaśminu zapach jest czysty i naturalny, a przy tym kobiecy i nowoczesny. Świetnie sprawdzi się na co dzień, także na plażę, do lnianych ubrań, zwiewnych sukienek i letnich koszul. Jeśli szukacie perfum, które nie zdominują waszego letniego looku, a jednocześnie zostawią po sobie lekki, świeży ślad — to jest strzał w dziesiątkę. W Notino flakon o pojemności 50 ml kosztuje 307,70 zł. [Perfumy Neroli Portofino Tom Ford – elegancja i cytrusy] Neroli Portofino to propozycja z wyższej półki, ale jej klimat rekompensuje cenę. Zapach unisex, który łączy w sobie soczyste cytrusy, kwiat pomarańczy i subtelne akordy zieleni. Pachnie jak wypoczynek w eleganckiej willi z widokiem na Liguryjskie Wybrzeże. To zapach chłodny i luksusowy, ale nieformalny. Zdecydowanie do noszenia wieczorem — na kolację w ogrodzie, randkę pod gołym niebem albo hotelowy rooftop. To perfumy, które nie potrzebują dodatków. Są wyraziste, ale z klasą. Neroli i cytrusy grają tu pierwsze skrzypce, ale tło — pełne nut zielonych i ziołowych — dodaje głębi. Wystarczą dwa psiknięcia, by zostawić po sobie elegancki ślad. Jeśli lubicie zapachy z charakterem, które nie krzyczą, ale przyciągają uwagę – ten zapach z pewnością zasługuje na miejsce w waszym bagażu. Za flakon o pojemności 100 ml zapłacicie w Notino 795 zł. [Perfumy Mandarino di Sicilia Acqua di Parma – słońce i energia] To zapach, który pachnie słońcem. Nie takim leniwym, porannym — ale tym popołudniowym, sycylijskim, intensywnym. Mandarino di Sicilia otwiera się soczystą mandarynką, która niemal natychmiast przywodzi na myśl letni targ w południowych Włoszech. Towarzyszą jej nuty bergamotki i grejpfruta, które nadają zapachowi świeżości i lekkości. Perfumy są energetyczne, radosne, a przy tym zaskakująco trwałe, jak na kompozycję cytrusową. To zapach, który możecie nosić przez cały dzień — od porannego espresso, przez plażowe sjesty, aż po kolację przy lampce białego wina. Idealny dla tych, którzy nie lubią przesady, ale cenią oryginalność. Unisexowa formuła sprawia, że bez problemu możecie dzielić go z partnerem czy partnerką — choć istnieje spore ryzyko, że sami zużyjecie flakon do końca sezonu. Buteleczka tych perfum o pojemności 100 ml w sklepach Sephora kosztuje 729 zł. Dobre perfumy latem potrafią więcej niż tylko pachnieć. Przywołują wspomnienia, wzmacniają wrażenia, dopełniają stylizację. Jeśli planujecie letni wyjazd — albo po prostu chcecie, by lato zostało z wami na dłużej — jeden z tych zapachów może stać się waszym osobistym wakacyjnym podpisem.","SPR_COMBO[pl]Planujecie urlop i już teraz zastanawiacie się, co wrzucić do walizki?
