July 15, 2025, 1:05am Macy's may be holding on to its longtime position as the top U.S. retailer by share of fragrance sales, but plenty of other shifts are afoot when it comes to who's winning the category. According to YipitData, Macy's accounted for 31.8 percent of fragrance sales during the month of May, indicating a 14.7-point lead from the category's next-biggest retailer during the period, Ulta Beauty. While significant, that lead is several points less than it was, say, two years prior in 2023, when Macy's accounted for more than 40 percent of fragrance sales during the same month. This shift is in part due to the nascent growth of alternative fragrance retailers as formidable competitors in the space. There's Amazon, which, per YipitData, accounted for 14.9 percent of fragrance sales in May across the platform's first- and third-party sellers (tracking after Sephora, which accounted for 15.5 percent during the same period). TikTok Shop, too, wasn't on the map at all in the U.S. until halfway through 2023, yet today the e-tailer — which has propelled brands from Lattafa to Phlur to virality — goes head-to-head with Target in terms of share of fragrance sales, actually outpacing Target slightly in May. Year-to-date, the top three fragrance brands at Sephora have been Kayali, Sol de Janeiro and YSL Beauty, in that order. For the month of May, Valentino overtook YSL for the number-three spot, while in April, Chanel's Chance Eau Splendide Eau de Parfum was the retailer's top-selling new stock keeping unit across the store. On Amazon, which YipitData reports has gained modest but steady share in fragrance since 2023, winning brands range from value-driven to designer, a dynamic which the platform's top two brands in May — Lattafa and Versace — quintessentially represent. Other top 10 brands on Amazon include Sol de Janeiro, Nautica and Dior (which, like all brands owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, does not officially sell on the platform). So far in 2025, fragrance has been the fastest-growing category in beauty, as has been the case since 2021. According to Circana, the category grew 4 percent in the prestige market and 8 percent in mass during the first quarter of this year.

mov_73E4ED1F1427B944611E55FC53EC0880,"  The beauty and personal care landscape continues to grow increasingly competitive in the advent of increased social selling, pushing industry stakeholders to pivot into increasingly creative, innovative efforts to reinvent category offerings. According to the recently released the new report by consumer insight firm NIQ, these efforts are paying dividends: e-commerce drove a 17.4% increase in beauty and health sales in 2024, with online now representing 42% of total category revenue. E-commerce, social selling, and the largest swing in category growth Among the trends tracked in NIQ's report, social media, wellness, personalization, and luxury, social media was highlighted as the most transformative force. “It's not just about visibility; TikTok is becoming a commerce channel itself,” said Anna Mayo, Vice President, Beauty Vertical at NIQ. Through “social selling (especially on TikTok Shop), rapid digital discovery, and retail consolidation around platforms like Amazon,” she told CosmeticsDesign USA, the beauty category has particularly benefited from the growing influence of impulse-driven purchases. As noted in NIQ's report, 68% of social buys are unplanned, with user-generated content as a main driver behind the conversion momentum. Leading beauty brands in this space, Mayo advised, are leveraging building blocks like “experiential digital storytelling, social-first product launches and agile fulfillment across platforms.” For example, brands such as e.l.f., Phlur, and Dove are developing launch strategies specifically tailored for social platforms. “This forces manufacturers to prioritize agility, trend responsiveness, and creator partnerships in product development and marketing,” she said. High-growth segments signal new consumer priorities The fragrance category was a notable outlier, according to the report, with a 20% year-over-year growth rate that was largely driven by viral trends and evolving consumer behavior, especially among Gen Z. For example, Mayo illustrated, “instead of having a signature scent, they are investing in a fragrance wardrobe, with scents for different moods and occasions, that can also be layered together.” Brands that are attuned to the demographic and behavioral shifts like this have responded by expanding hero fragrances into new product formats, such as body care, and intensifying social media campaigns. “With fragrance's emotional and identity-driven appeal, as well as its continued innovation in formats and storytelling, the category is well-positioned for continued growth,” she added. Several other emerging and previously underperforming segments also outpaced expectations in 2024. “Categories like first aid, lip care, and men's body care stood out with high-growth product launches,” she said. Products like Dr. Squatch lip balm and Band-Aid Pro Heal Bandages, for example, reflected a growing demand for “wellness-adjacent personal care” and innovation in functional and inclusive product design. Strategic innovation imperative for 2025 and beyond The impact of brand innovation, which the report noted contributed to nine percent of mass retail beauty sales, cannot be understated, said Mayo. Citing examples like Sol de Janeiro's Rio Deo and SheaMoisture's Even Tone Deodorant as evidence that consumers respond positively to new offerings from trusted brands, the data demonstrated that line extensions have been a successful endeavor for some beauty brands over the past year. “These cases show that consumers gravitate toward familiar, trusted brands offering new formats that match their values, whether that's wellness, inclusivity or luxury feel at mass price points,” she explained. However, she cautioned, while innovation is “a critical driver of brand growth, especially in times of economic uncertainty...the data shows that while line extensions dominate, not all innovation leads to incremental growth, so brands must be diligent in assessing whether new products are additive or potentially cannibalizing existing sales.” Ultimately, she concluded, “success will depend on staying agile, insight-driven, and culturally relevant, developing products that not only meet functional needs but also tap into emerging values and behaviors shaping the future of health and beauty.”","The beauty and personal care landscape continues to grow increasingly competitive in the advent of increased social selling, pushing industry stakeholders to pivot into increasingly creative, innovative efforts to reinvent category offerings.

A bleach-free, no-scrub weekly shower spray so soap scum and shower grime buildup goes bye bye without anyone ever having to bend down or wipe. Rinse it clean the next day, and you'll be amazed to see those hard water stains on your shower door are *poof* gone. Promising review: ""I am 51 with a 31-year-old back injury from the military. It has become much harder in recent years to test my limits the way I did when I was younger, and eventually, I couldn't scrub our bathtubs and showers without incapacitating spasms. I tried other cleaners similar to this that might as well have been plain water, but the previous positive reviews persuaded me to give this a shot. THIS IS GOLD! I used it for several days in a row as suggested at first, and I was surprised to see how much of a difference it made in just that first week. Now I have a weekly ritual every Sunday where I move all the hair products and soap to the bathroom counter after my shower, and I start by spraying the shower doors from inside first, then covering the fiberglass walls from top to bottom from outside the shower, including the fixtures, the floor, and the tracks for the sliding glass doors. I cannot say enough how thankful I am to have found an effective cleaner that does the work I can't physically do anymore. I swear by this and would recommend it to ANYONE, whether they have physical limitations like me or just want to skip the scrubbing and save the time!"" —Mary Weir Get it from Amazon for $20.98 (available in two scents). 2. A teeth-whitening pen that'll be a heck of a lot quicker (and taste a lot better) than those irritating whitening strips that slip and slide all over your teeth. You can use each pen ~20 times and should expect your teeth to lighten four to eight shades. Promising review: ""I've had stained teeth from drinking coffee for over 50 years. I tried brushing after having my daily coffee and even used a professional solution in a tray, but nothing worked. I used the AsaVea pen twice on the first day and saw immediate results. After a week of using the pen as directed twice a day, I'm proud to smile!"" —Amazon Customer Get a two-pack from Amazon for $12.99. 3. A beloved Sol de Janeiro tightening cream because the 40,000+ reviewers who rated it 5 stars are all the proof you need. It's infused with caffeine, coconut oil, and guarana extract to firm, smooth, and add shimmer to the skin. Plus, the vanilla, salted caramel, and pistachio scent is better than any perfume out there. Promising review: ""I am 60, and I could not get rid of the cellulite on my legs. I started using this product six weeks ago and can noticeably see a difference. I apply morning and evening before bed for optimal results. It goes on smooth and has a creamy, non-sticky feel. The smell is dreamy, and even my husband has commented on the improvement. Make sure you apply in a circular motion for optimal coverage, absorption, and circulation."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24+ (available in two sizes). 4. A pair of compression gloves for giving your joints a comforting (and breathable!) bear hug throughout the day that may help relieve pain caused by arthritis, carpal tunnel, and tendonitis. Read more about compression gloves and osteoarthritis at Mayo Clinic. Promising review: ""I'm 70 years old and have arthritis in my hands. I've used copper bracelets and other gloves for several years, and they are somewhat helpful, but these gloves seem to do a lot better. They have a tight fit and are very comfortable. They are very durable, as I wear them while working outside, hunting, fishing, or whatever. The other gloves I've had would have been torn and ripped up by now, but these gloves look like I just took them out of the box, and I've washed them twice."" —Keith Proffer Get a pair from Amazon for $9.97 (available in four sizes). 5. A pair of super-soft, ultra-stretchy, and oh-so-cozy Levi's pull-on skinny jeans to save the day when you want the look of real denim but not the constricting feel. Promising review: ""I hate jeans....","""It took me 'til my 50s to find this amazing product. I sure coulda used this in my 20s."" 1. A bleach-free, no-scrub weekly shower spray so soap scum and shower grime buildup goes bye bye without anyone ever having to bend down or wipe. Rinse it clean the next day, and you'll be amazed to see those hard water stains on your shower door are *poof* gone. Promising review: ""I am 51 with a 31-year-old back injury from the military. It has become much harder in recent years to test my limits the way I did when I was younger, and eventually, I couldn't scrub our bathtubs and showers without incapacitating spasms. I tried other cleaners similar to this that might as well have been plain water, but the previous positive reviews persuaded me to give this a shot. THIS IS GOLD! I used it for several days in a row as suggested at first, and I was surprised to see how much of a difference it made in just that first week. Now I have a weekly ritual every Sunday where I move all the hair products and soap to the bathroom counter after my shower, and I start by spraying the shower doors from inside first, then covering the fiberglass walls from top to bottom from outside the shower, including the fixtures, the floor, and the tracks for the sliding glass doors. I cannot say enough how thankful I am to have found an effective cleaner that does the work I can't physically do anymore. I swear by this and would recommend it to ANYONE, whether they have physical limitations like me or just want to skip the scrubbing and save the time!"" —Mary Weir Get it from Amazon for $20.98 (available in two scents). 2. A teeth-whitening pen that'll be a heck of a lot quicker (and taste a lot better) than those irritating whitening strips that slip and slide all over your teeth. You can use each pen ~20 times and should expect your teeth to lighten four to eight shades. Promising review: ""I've had stained teeth from drinking coffee for over 50 years. I tried brushing after having my daily coffee and even used a professional solution in a tray, but nothing worked. I used the AsaVea pen twice on the first day and saw immediate results. After a week of using the pen as directed twice a day, I'm proud to smile!"" —Amazon Customer Get a two-pack from Amazon for $12.99. 3. A beloved Sol de Janeiro tightening cream because the 40,000+ reviewers who rated it 5 stars are all the proof you need. It's infused with caffeine, coconut oil, and guarana extract to firm, smooth, and add shimmer to the skin. Plus, the vanilla, salted caramel, and pistachio scent is better than any perfume out there. Promising review: ""I am 60, and I could not get rid of the cellulite on my legs. I started using this product six weeks ago and can noticeably see a difference. I apply morning and evening before bed for optimal results. It goes on smooth and has a creamy, non-sticky feel. The smell is dreamy, and even my husband has commented on the improvement.

A limited edition (!!) Eos Marshmallow ""Super Balm"" lip treatment from the brand's ""secret menu"" so good that reviewers say it's better than Carmex for healing and better than Summer Fridays for quality. Lip care that also tastes like you're perpetually eating a s'more for less than $5?? My friends, life is good. Check out a TikTok of the marshmallow lip treatment in action. Promising review: ""My new must-have! My number one go-to for healing lips was Carmex. This beat it.

Catrice ""Instant Awake"" Under Eye Brightener, which became the internet's holy grail — now in four shades! — for concealing and brightening dark circles under your eyes so fast that everyone's old concealers are doing double takes. This lightweight color-adapting formula is designed for truly ~invisible~ coverage that makes a drastic difference. The color-adaptive formula is designed so one of two shades will work on any skin tone. Promising review: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable.

A delightfully affordable instant foot peeling spray for anyone ready to go full YEEHAW!! on a pedicure, without the big salon price tag. This not only helps gently remove dead skin, but moisturizes dry and cracked heels, so you'll really get some refreshing bang for your buck. Promising review: ""This product delivers exactly as promised and is incredibly easy to use. I suffer from dry skin and often apply various products to soften my feet. With this, I simply spray it on and immediately massage it in with my hands. The dead skin comes off effortlessly. There's no waiting time, and it's gentle on the skin. It leaves my feet feeling exceptionally soft. This has quickly become my new favorite thing."" —KimT Get it from Amazon for $5.48. 2. A tinted lip balm that's eerily close to the same magic as ""Black Honey,"" TikTok's beloved $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique, that it will genuinely startle you — especially when you see the price. This is a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lippie that's just a step above the ""no makeup makeup"" look, giving the perfect subtly polished effect. I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference! Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures.

Reviewers especially love how affordable this is compared to creams that often cost three times this $12 price tag (or more)! Promising review: ""I am a lotion user every single day.
