Beauty and cosmetics major L'Oreal has appointed Jacques Lebel as its India country manager, replacing Aseem Kaushik who will be the company's chairman. Both appointments will be effective October 1, 2025. Lebel previously served as general manager of the consumer products division (CPD) for L'Oreal in Mexico, where he significantly accelerated business growth. Earlier, Lebel held senior marketing and general management roles at companies including P&> and AB InBev across Europe, India, the Middle East, and Africa. The Indian subsidiary of French multinational L'Oreal SA said Kaushik's new role underscores its commitment to India's dynamic market landscape with a mandate to focus on corporate reputation, managing public affairs, strengthening stakeholder engagement, and driving corporate social responsibility initiatives. ""The leadership transition is to do with catalysing growth in a high-potential market like India,"" said an executive who requested anonymity.

L'Oreal India's sales grew 14% to ₹5,685 crore during FY25 while its net profit was flat at ₹488 crore. The performance was significantly lower than previous two fiscals when its revenues grew over 30%, indicating surging competition, especially from new-age direct-to-consumer rivals that are targeting younger consumer cohorts.

63DEC1342F6DF6D2FA24F39C5DD36D61,"  New Delhi | Mumbai: Yet another market leader is headed for a leadership   shake-up. Beauty and cosmetics   major L'Oreal has appointed Jacques Lebel as its India country manager, replacing Aseem Kaushik who will be the company's chairman. Both appointments will be effective   October 1, 2025. Lebel previously served as general   manager of the consumer products   division (CPD) for L'Oreal in Mexico, where he significantly accelerated   business growth. Earlier, Lebel held senior marketing and general management roles at companies   including P&G and AB InBev   across Europe, India, the Middle East, and Africa. The Indian subsidiary of French multinational L'Oreal said Kaushik's   new role underscores its commitment   to India's dynamic market   landscape with a mandate to focus on corporate reputation, managing   public affairs, strengthening stakeholder engagement   and driving corporate social   responsibility initiatives. ""The leadership transition is to do with catalysing growth in a high-potential market like India,"" said an executive who requested anonymity. ""Competition from the naturals segment, digital-only, and regional beauty brands, many of which sell at lower prices or through   subscription-based models, has intensified very aggressively in recent years,"" the person noted. ""Incumbents can no longer take their share for granted."" This comes days after FMCG leader   Hindustan Unilever on July 10 announced that its CEO and managing   director of two years, Rohit   Jawa, was stepping down. He will be succeeded by another Unilever   veteran, Priya Nair, effective   August 1. For L'Oreal, which has a legacy portfolio of brands including   L'Oreal Paris, Garnier, Maybelline   New York and NYX Professional   Makeup, India is a core strategic market. Its global chief Nicolas Hieronimus   had told reporters last month that it intends to ""more than double its production in India in the next couple of years from the current production of half-a-billion units."" In the hair and beauty salons segment,   L'Oréal's portfolio includes L'Oreal Professionnel, Matrix and Kerastase. It also distributes premium   labels Kiehl's, Lancome and Yves Saint Laurent in India. L'Oreal India's sales grew 14% to Rs 5,685 crore during FY25 while its net profit was flat at Rs 488 crore. The performance was significantly   lower than previous two fiscals when its revenues grew over 30%, indicating surging competition, especially from new-age direct-toconsumer   rivals that are targeting younger consumer cohorts. Kaushik joined L'Oréal in 1995 with the consumer products division and was part of the L'Oréal startup operations   in India in the East and North and launched L'Oreal consumer   brands like Garnier, Maybelline   and L'Oréal Paris across the country. He was elevated as the country   head in January 2023 after a brief stint as head of professional products   in Singapore and Hong Kong. The French cosmetics firm has about 8% share of India's face-care market dominated by Hindustan Unilever with more than 40% share. L'Oreal is the market leader in the hair colour segment and has, over the past decade, trained about 3.3 million hairdressers. The company entered India three decades ago by selling affordable packs and sachets, including its largest   selling product Garnier hair colour. Its reach is however only limited   to only about 230 million people who have a purchasing power parity of over $20 a day. India currently accounts for just over 1% of L'Oreal's annual sales of over ¤ 41 billion, making it the 15th biggest market worldwide. The company   expects the country to rank among its top 10 markets within the next few years with an annual revenue   of ¤ 1 billion. India's beauty and personal care market is estimated to touch sales of $34 billion by 2028, up from $20 billion presently, a NykaaRedseer   Strategy Consultants Beauty   Trends report said. It cited ""aspirational   spending, reach and discoverability   through e-commerce and quick commerce, and social media influences"" as growth drivers.","New Delhi | Mumbai: Yet another market leader is headed for a leadership shake-up.
