Les Eurockéennes : le plus éclectique Organisées depuis 1989 par l'association à but non lucratif Territoire de Musiques, sur le site naturel de la presqu'île de Malsaucy, près de Belfort, dans l'est de la France, les Eurockéennes se tiendront cette année du jeudi 29 juin au dimanche 2 juillet. Une fois n'est pas coutume, cette 33ème édition sera marquée par la nouveauté et un line-up éclectique, mettant en avant une grande diversité de styles musicaux et mélangeant artistes établi·e·s et émergeant·e·s. Cette année, plus de 80 % des artistes programmé·e·s se produiront d'ailleurs pour la première fois aux Eurockéennes. Répartis sur quatre jours et quatre scènes, les 52 concerts en plein air seront le fruit d'une programmation transversale et pointue. Le jeudi 29 juin, la rappeuse britannique Shygirl montera sur scène pour interpréter ses titres corrosifs aux connotations sexuelles explicites, tout comme le DJ Skrillex, qui faisait son retour en février dernier avec un nouvel album, ou encore le célèbre rappeur Niska. 070 Shake, Orelsan et Meryl seront quant à eux·elles à l'affiche du festival le lendemain, avant de passer le relai à Lomepal, Dinos, Pomme, Lous & The Yakuza, Kungs, Jeanne Added ou encore Vladimir Cauchermar le samedi 1er juillet.

ac838b6c505130ab7e954b9ed5eeb6b1,"  SPR_COMBO[hr]Gianni Versace (50) upravo je otključao vrata svog doma nakon doručka u News Caféu na Ocean Driveu. Čuveni dizajner i vlasnik najpoznatijeg talijanskog visokomodnog brenda tog dana sam se zaputio do trgovine ne bi li kupio talijanske novine, što je inače umjesto njega radio osobni asistent. Došao je pred kuću, krenuo se penjati stubama prema ulaznim vratima kad mu je s leđa prišao naoružani muškarac. Prošlo je točno 28 godina tragične smrti ikone modne industrije Giannija Versacea. S dva hica iz pištolja ubijen je na stepenicama svoje viel Casa Casuarina u Miami Beachu 15. srpnja 1997. godine. Kad je trebao ući u vilu, Andrew Cunanan je u njega ispalio dva hica - jednim mu je raznio lice, a drugi metak je završio u vratu. Pored Giannijeva tijela pronađena je mrtva ptica te se dugo sumnjalo da se mafija zbog dugova konačno obračunala s njim i ostavila pticu kao poruku. Međutim, naposljetku se ispostavilo da je komadić metka sluačajno pogodio životinju i sumnje vezane za mafiju pale su u vodu. Bilo je to djelo Cunanana, homoseksualca koji je za život zarađivao kao svojevrsni žigolo. Točnije, njegova strategija bila je da se skompa sa starijim bogatašima te od njih muze novac i poklone. Nakon što je u dva tjedna počinio pet ubojstava kroz nekoliko američkih saveznih država, Cunanana su pronašli na brodici u luci, nedaleko od Versacijeve vile. Počinio je suicid istim pištoljem kojim je obavio svih pet krvavih zločina. Iza Versacijeve smrti ostalo je modno carstvo vrijedno 685 milijuna dolara, 130 butika diljem svijeta i kompanija koja je dosegnula milijunske prihode, i to svega u nekoliko godina. Poznati logo carstva Versace, okrugli znak s Meduzinom glavom, posveta je onome što je Giannija oduvijek inspiriralo. A to su grčka i rimska kultura, Etrušćani i talijanski barok te je sve njih na ovaj ili onaj način provukao kroz svoje kolekcije. Gianni, sestra Donatella i brat Santo odrastali su u talijanskoj regiji Calabriji u stanu iznad majčine šnajderske radnje, dok se otac bavio prodajom ugljena. Ali majka Francesca nije bila tek obična švelja. Prije svega, bila je poduzetnica koja je upošljavala pedesetak šivačica. Njezin salon Elle krojio je i šivao za onodobnu talijansku gospodu. Giannija je njegova ljubav prema modi privukla vrlo rano. Već se s devet godina motao po majčinoj radnji i promatrao kako nastaju njezine modne kreacije, a svoj prvi primjerak haljine sašio je 1955. godine. ""Dizajniranje je došlo k meni. Nisam morao nikud ići"", izjavio je jednom. Jednako tako bilo je s Donatellom koja je od njega mlađa 11 godina. Ali gonjen svojim životnim pozivom, i to nakon studija arhitekture, 1972. godine Gianni odlazi u Milano gdje honorarno kreira za poznate talijanske modne kuće, a već 1978. godine pokreće svoje carstvo Versace. Odmah zapošljava brata Santosa, koji je dotad već diplomirao menadžment i kojeg postavlja za direktora kompanije, dok je Donatella bila zadužena za glazbu, kreativne ideje i cijelu vizualno-glazbenu priču Giannijevih revija. Kažu da mu je bila muza, dok je Santo bio idejni začetnik modnog brenda koji će pokoriti ono što je dotad bilo smatrano visokom modnom industrijom. Vrlo brzo se zahuktala priča s Giannijem Versacijem. Njegove ideje donijele su pravo osvježenje na talijansku scenu kojom su dotad vladali klasični i samozatajni krojevi Giorgija Armanija. Kao šakom u oku, Gianni je počeo propagirati spoj moderne umjetnosti sa štihovima stare grčke kulture, a utjecaj rock glazbe u njegovim kolekcijama bio je tad presedan u modernom dizajnu. Pokorio je talijanske piste i tržište uskim i kratkim mini suknjama blještavih boja i dotad nekorištenih materijala, a kaže da su ga inspirirale talijanske prostitutke. Kao jedan od velikih poklonika umjetnosti, a sve je poteklo iz činjenice da je regija iz koje je došao nekad davno bila grčka kolonija, u svojim domovima skupljao je sve, od najsuvremenijih umjetničkih djela (posebno je volio Andyja Warhola) pa do grčkih statua. Osim toga, započeo je s novim tehnologijama u izradi odjeće pa je tako posebnim metodama spajao gumu i kožu u ekstravagantne odjevne predmete, kombinirajući tako talijanski barok sa suvremenim izričajem. Rock glazba bila je njegov unutarnji pogon, a Umjetnik ili Prince bio je pop-rock ikona koja je često stvarala glazbu za njegove revije. Ali ne samo on: prijateljevao je s Eltonom Johnom, Madonnom za koju je uredio poseban salon u crvenom i zlatnom gdje je odsjedala u njegovoj kući, Courtney Love te gomilom drugih zvijezda i zvjezdica koji su obilježili devedesete. Često ga se moglo vidjeti na večerama s Tupacom Shakurom, Stingom... Taj eklektični spoj moćnog rocka i njegove vizije onoga kako bi suvremena moda trebala izgledati donio je sasvim novu svježinu na već pomalo ustaljenu i dosadnjikavu svjetsku modnu scenu. Gianni Versace unio je sasvim nove pojmove mode u svijet pa je tako jako inzistirao na tome da mu u prvim redovima na revijama sjede Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista i Kate Moss. I na taj način povezao je ono što je nekad bila visoka moda rezervirana samo za najuži krug ljudi na sceni u jedinstvenom miksu glazbe, mode i umjetnosti. Na svoj način doveo je pojam supermodela na visok nivo. Moramo li naglasiti činjenicu da je haljinu koju je sašio sa samo devet godina nakon četrdeset godina u novoj verziji nosila princeza Diana za jedan fotoshooting? Njegova neiscrpna i neutaživa glad za umjetnošću i književnošću dovela je do toga da je ovaj eklektični dizajner zapošljavao na puno radno vrijeme i vlastitog knjižničara koji se brinuo o njegovih pet veličanstvenih privatnih knjižnica! ""Nerijetko ga se moglo vidjeti okruženog s 50-ak knjiga koje su ležale po sofama i stolu dok je ugošćavao prijatelje"", rekla je Anna Wintour u jednom intervjuu. I u vrijeme kad je gay populacija još čučala duboko u svojim ormarima, Gianni je bio otvoren po pitanju svoje homoseksualnosti. Još 1982. Gianni je upoznao Antonija D'Amica, talijanskog modela, koji je s vremenom postao kreator Sports divizije u Versacijevu carstvu. Njihova veza trajala je dugih 15 godina, sve dok Gianni u svojoj pedesetoj nije tragično završio pred vratima svoje vile Casa Casuarina. ""Čuo sam pucanj. Srce mi je prestalo kucati"", izjavio je Giannijev partner koji je u vrijeme ubojstva bio u kući. Gianni je Antoniju oporučno ostavio doživotnu mirovinu od 26.000 dolara mjesečno te pravo na boravak u bilo kojoj Versaceovoj rezidenciji, ali su mu Donatella i Santo tijekom ostavinskih rasprava osporili to pravo te time na neki način ignorirali želju svojega brata....","SPR_COMBO[hr]Gianni Versace (50) upravo je otključao vrata svog doma nakon doručka u News Caféu na Ocean Driveu.

Vrlo brzo se zahuktala priča s Giannijem Versacijem. Njegove ideje donijele su pravo osvježenje na talijansku scenu kojom su dotad vladali klasični i samozatajni krojevi Giorgija Armanija. Kao šakom u oku, Gianni je počeo propagirati spoj moderne umjetnosti sa štihovima stare grčke kulture, a utjecaj rock glazbe u njegovim kolekcijama bio je tad presedan u modernom dizajnu. Pokorio je talijanske piste i tržište uskim i kratkim mini suknjama blještavih boja i dotad nekorištenih materijala, a kaže da su ga inspirirale talijanske prostitutke. Kao jedan od velikih poklonika umjetnosti, a sve je poteklo iz činjenice da je regija iz koje je došao nekad davno bila grčka kolonija, u svojim domovima skupljao je sve, od najsuvremenijih umjetničkih djela (posebno je volio Andyja Warhola) pa do grčkih statua. Osim toga, započeo je s novim tehnologijama u izradi odjeće pa je tako posebnim metodama spajao gumu i kožu u ekstravagantne odjevne predmete, kombinirajući tako talijanski barok sa suvremenim izričajem. Rock glazba bila je njegov unutarnji pogon, a Umjetnik ili Prince bio je pop-rock ikona koja je često stvarala glazbu za njegove revije. Ali ne samo on: prijateljevao je s Eltonom Johnom, Madonnom za koju je uredio poseban salon u crvenom i zlatnom gdje je odsjedala u njegovoj kući, Courtney Love te gomilom drugih zvijezda i zvjezdica koji su obilježili devedesete. Često ga se moglo vidjeti na večerama s Tupacom Shakurom, Stingom... Taj eklektični spoj moćnog rocka i njegove vizije onoga kako bi suvremena moda trebala izgledati donio je sasvim novu svježinu na već pomalo ustaljenu i dosadnjikavu svjetsku modnu scenu. Gianni Versace unio je sasvim nove pojmove mode u svijet pa je tako jako inzistirao na tome da mu u prvim redovima na revijama sjede Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista i Kate Moss. I na taj način povezao je ono što je nekad bila visoka moda rezervirana samo za najuži krug ljudi na sceni u jedinstvenom miksu glazbe, mode i umjetnosti. Na svoj način doveo je pojam supermodela na visok nivo. Moramo li naglasiti činjenicu da je haljinu koju je sašio sa samo devet godina nakon četrdeset godina u novoj verziji nosila princeza Diana za jedan fotoshooting? Njegova neiscrpna i neutaživa glad za umjetnošću i književnošću dovela je do toga da je ovaj eklektični dizajner zapošljavao na puno radno vrijeme i vlastitog knjižničara koji se brinuo o njegovih pet veličanstvenih privatnih knjižnica! ""Nerijetko ga se moglo vidjeti okruženog s 50-ak knjiga koje su ležale po sofama i stolu dok je ugošćavao prijatelje"", rekla je Anna Wintour u jednom intervjuu. I u vrijeme kad je gay populacija još čučala duboko u svojim ormarima, Gianni je bio otvoren po pitanju svoje homoseksualnosti. Još 1982. Gianni je upoznao Antonija D'Amica, talijanskog modela, koji je s vremenom postao kreator Sports divizije u Versacijevu carstvu. Njihova veza trajala je dugih 15 godina, sve dok Gianni u svojoj pedesetoj nije tragično završio pred vratima svoje vile Casa Casuarina. ""Čuo sam pucanj. Srce mi je prestalo kucati"", izjavio je Giannijev partner koji je u vrijeme ubojstva bio u kući. Gianni je Antoniju oporučno ostavio doživotnu mirovinu od 26.000 dolara mjesečno te pravo na boravak u bilo kojoj Versaceovoj rezidenciji, ali su mu Donatella i Santo tijekom ostavinskih rasprava osporili to pravo te time na neki način ignorirali želju svojega brata....",2025-07-15 04:22:00,hr,WEB,,,,,False,1,False,False,None,None,"The provided text is a detailed biographical article in Croatian about Gianni Versace, discussing his life, murder, fashion career, and personal history.

mov_7FF3B66C777EBAE5656F10EF1591252E,"  Findings from YipitData show that TikTok Shop and Target are neck-and-neck by fragrance sales; Kayali is number one at Sephora, and more. July 15, 2025, 1:05am Macy's may be holding on to its longtime position as the top U.S. retailer by share of fragrance sales, but plenty of other shifts are afoot when it comes to who's winning the category. According to YipitData, Macy's accounted for 31.8 percent of fragrance sales during the month of May, indicating a 14.7-point lead from the category's next-biggest retailer during the period, Ulta Beauty. While significant, that lead is several points less than it was, say, two years prior in 2023, when Macy's accounted for more than 40 percent of fragrance sales during the same month. This shift is in part due to the nascent growth of alternative fragrance retailers as formidable competitors in the space. There's Amazon, which, per YipitData, accounted for 14.9 percent of fragrance sales in May across the platform's first- and third-party sellers (tracking after Sephora, which accounted for 15.5 percent during the same period). TikTok Shop, too, wasn't on the map at all in the U.S. until halfway through 2023, yet today the e-tailer — which has propelled brands from Lattafa to Phlur to virality — goes head-to-head with Target in terms of share of fragrance sales, actually outpacing Target slightly in May. Year-to-date, the top three fragrance brands at Sephora have been Kayali, Sol de Janeiro and YSL Beauty, in that order. For the month of May, Valentino overtook YSL for the number-three spot, while in April, Chanel's Chance Eau Splendide Eau de Parfum was the retailer's top-selling new stock keeping unit across the store. On Amazon, which YipitData reports has gained modest but steady share in fragrance since 2023, winning brands range from value-driven to designer, a dynamic which the platform's top two brands in May — Lattafa and Versace — quintessentially represent. Other top 10 brands on Amazon include Sol de Janeiro, Nautica and Dior (which, like all brands owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, does not officially sell on the platform). So far in 2025, fragrance has been the fastest-growing category in beauty, as has been the case since 2021. According to Circana, the category grew 4 percent in the prestige market and 8 percent in mass during the first quarter of this year.

White made sure her bridesmaids looked just as good as she did at the wedding ceremony by designing all of their baby blue corset dresses. “I had a very specific vision in mind, so that left me with one option — to make my bridesmaid dresses myself,” she told the fashion magazine. “I have always been a hobby seamstress and have made my own looks for a few red-carpet events before, so I decided to give it a go."" She continued: ""I have to admit they did end up taking a lot longer than I anticipated — each dress took me around 30 hours to construct and hand-embellish — but it was totally worth it. My bridesmaids looked beyond stunning and now they are the first — and hopefully not last — to ever have a bespoke Madeleine White dress.” White and Fedyk's romance began after they were set up by mutual friends in July 2020.

The fashion influencer tied the knot with DJ Andrew Fedyk at the Cavo Ventus Villa in Santorini, Greece, on Saturday, July 12, per Vogue. Ahead of her wedding, White's 5 million TikTok followers eagerly awaited to see what she would wear during her walk down the aisle, and they weren't disappointed. Before she got engaged in Toronto in December 2023, White stumbled upon a video of a Viktor & Rolf gown from the Dutch label's Spring 2023 bridal collection while scrolling on TikTok. She explained to the outlet that she initially saved the clip for fun, but when it finally came time to try on wedding dresses, she couldn't get the strapless gown out of her head. “I reached out to the Viktor & Rolf team to see if I could go to their offices and try on the dress, since it was no longer being stocked in store. I put it on my body and knew it was my dress,"" White told Vogue, noting that the fashion house customized the design with 40 hand-appliquéd butterflies. Later in the wedding night, White switched into a backless halter dress by Berta and a pink chain-mail dress from Versace and Fendi's 2022 collaboration for her reception and after-party, respectively.

Unfortunately I do not like any of them except for Sweet Tooth by Sabrina Carpenter. It's a very light, clean scent, but doesn't last. The Bellavita Senorita is a stronger version of Versace Bright Crystal which I already own and don't particularly care for. If you like that scent, then that one is definitely worth buying. The rest of them smell like a substitute teacher from the 90's. Very powdery and overpowering. Also, none are reminiscent of any gourmand scent I've tried. A disappointing hall to say the least. Don't make the same mistake I did.

The upcoming series The Assassin is generating significant excitement as it readies for release on Prime Video, boasting an illustrious ensemble cast against a picturesque setting. The narrative follows Julie, a retired assassin, and her alienated son Edward, pushing their fraught relationship to the brink in an intense battle for survival. Taking place in Greece, the tension-laden drama promises a mix of spectacular stunts, witty exchanges, and profound character connections. Series creators Harry and Jack Williams share their insight: ""At its heart, it's an emotional story about a mother and a son, with several other genre elements at play. ""There are assassins, action, comedy, and all in the lovely setting of Greece."" Below are the key details about this highly anticipated show. When is The Assassin out? The Assassin airs on Prime Video globally on July 25, with all of the episodes available to stream. Prime Video typically releases new entries at midnight on the launch day. Who is in the cast of The Assassin? Keeley Hawes will be on the roster for The Assassin, the 49 year old English actress acclaimed for her performances in Spooks and Ashes to Ashes. Freddie Highmore, aged 33, joins the cast, the English actor famed for his work in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Bates Motel. Highmore expresses his fascination with the project saying: ""The unique tone of the series was also a big draw for me. It's a thriller that has high stakes, it's tense and violent at times, but at the same time, there's always this dark humour that underlies it. ""The character moments, the central relationship, and those beats of dark humour and wit are exciting and really attracted me to the project."" The series boasts a talented ensemble cast, including Gina Gershon as Marie and Gerald Kyd as Luka. Gershon, a renowned 63 year old American actress and singer, has notable roles in Showgirls, Killer Joe, and House of Versace, while Kyd, a half-Greek, half-Scottish actor, previously played Sean Maddox in Casualty. Shalom Brune-Franklin takes on the role of Kayla, and Devon Terrell plays her brother Ezra. Brune-Franklin is a talented British and Australian actress known for her performances in Our Girl, The Tourist, and The State. Terrell, an Australian actor, made a name for himself playing a young Barack Obama in the 2016 biographical film Barry. How many episodes are in The Assassin?

The series kicks off by delving into the complex history between Julie and Edward, and the finale promises a thrilling showdown as Julie faces the consequences of her past actions.

Es war die Rückkehr von Brace zum Sattel nach einer 12-wöchigen Verletzungsentfernung, während der 70-jährige Trainer Allen einen langen Zauber zwischen den Besuchen des Gewinners des Gewinners überschritt. Dies war nur sein zweiter Sieg nach Regeln – bemerkenswerterweise 31 Jahre nach seinem ersten 1994. Sein letzter kam mit Blue Danube, der im Mai 1994 in Cheltenham das Vale of Evesham Hunters 'Chase gewann. Das Ergebnis war für beide emotional. Brace sagte: „Der Sieg brachte Stephens Auge eine Träne. Ich versprach ihm nach der Verletzung, dass ich ihm einen Gewinner fahre, und das habe ich jetzt getan. Er war absolut überglücklich. “Der letzte Gewinner, den ich ihm gegeben habe, war in einem Punkt zu Punkt, so dass es noch spezieller ist, dies unter Regeln zu tun.” Er fügte hinzu: “Als er sich seine Form ansah, lief er gut, als er in Warwick den zweiten Platz belegte, aber es hatte nicht ganz nachgedacht. Es ist immer großartig, einen Gewinner zu bekommen-besonders für Stephen, der mich auch bei Spitzanzügeln unterstützte.” Brace wurde am 25. April verletzt, als er in einer Handicap-Verfolgungsjagd für Nigel Twiston-Davies mit einem Hochverrat fuhr und fiel. Er brach seinen T9- und L1 -Wirbel, hat sich aber bemerkenswert erholt und kehrte in knapp 13 Wochen zum Rennen zurück. Als er über seine Verletzung und Genesung nachdachte, sagte er: „Von als ich es tat, als ich vier Tage später zurückkam, konnten sie nicht verstehen, warum ich selbst nach MRT-Scans und Röntgenstrahlen keine Schmerzen hatte. “Ich habe eine 30-Grad-Komprimierung in meiner Wirbelsäule. Es wurde von einer Operation gesprochen, aber weil ich keine Schmerzen hatte und die Übungen ohne Anstrengung durchlief, brauchte ich keine.” Jetzt im Sattel will Brace dynamisch aufbauen. “Ich bin wahrscheinlich schneller zurückgekommen als ich sollte. Ich bin sehr glücklich in dieser Hinsicht”, fügte er hinzu. „Du bist immer ein bisschen nervös, wenn du auf das erste Pferd zurückkommst, besonders wieder direkt über Zäune. Aber sobald du die erste bist, geht alles aus [of] das Fenster. Am Ende des Tages ist es dein Job, nicht wahr? “Es kommt nicht sehr oft vor, kommt von einer langen Verletzung zurück und hüpft mit einem solchen Gewinner zurück.” Auf die Zukunft sagte Brace: “Ich habe ein paar Fahrten gebucht – ich bin am Sonntag in Stratford. Fahren Sie mit Versace Twentyone für Sheila Lewis, die ich zuvor gewonnen habe. Hoffentlich wird es eine weitere nette, unkomplizierte.” Grillon de Monty schloss sich im Dezember 2024 Allens Hof von Dan Skelton an und war seitdem in acht Starts vor diesem Durchbruch gewonnen. Der Zehnjährige ist eines von nur sechs Pferden, die in den letzten fünf Jahren für Allen, der in Oxfordshire ansässig ist und hauptsächlich für Point-to-Point-Rennen ansässig ist, unter den Regeln laufen.

The series follows Julie, a retired assassin, and her son Edward as they navigate their strained relationship while fighting to stay alive. Set against the picturesque backdrop of Greece, 'The Assassin' promises a mix of breathtaking stunts, witty repartee, and intense character dynamics. Creators Harry and Jack Williams shared: ""At its heart, it's an emotional story about a mother and a son, with several other genre elements at play."" They added: ""There are assassins, action, comedy, and all in the lovely setting of Greece."" Here's the lowdown on what to expect from the much-anticipated series. When can viewers expect The Assassin to hit Prime Video? The Assassin airs on Prime Video globally on July 25, with all of the episodes available to stream. Titles on Prime Video typically become available at midnight on their release date. Who is in The Assassin? Keeley Hawes, 49, is set to star, bringing her experience from 'Spooks' and 'Ashes to Ashes' to the table. Freddie Highmore, 33, also joins the cast, known for his roles in 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' and 'Bates Motel'. Highmore expressed his enthusiasm for the project, stating: ""The unique tone of the series was also a big draw for me. It's a thriller that has high stakes, it's tense and violent at times, but at the same time, there's always this dark humour that underlies it. ""The character moments, the central relationship, and those beats of dark humour and wit are exciting and really attracted me to the project."" Star-studded The Assassin introduces Gina Gershon as Marie, with Gerald Kyd featuring as Luka. Age-defying Gershon, at 63, is an American icon known for roles in Showgirls, Killer Joe, and House of Versace. Meanwhile, Kyd brings a blend of Greek and Scottish heritage to his role, previously seen as Sean Maddox in Casualty. Adding fresh talent, Shalom Brune-Franklin plays Kayla, and Devon Terrell steps in as her sibling Ezra. Brune-Franklin, a Brit-Australian talent, has shone in hits such as Our Girl, The Tourist, and The State. Terrell, hailing from Down Under, is celebrated for portraying Barack Obama in the biopic Barry from 2016. How many episodes are in The Assassin? The series is made up of six episodes, which will all be available to watch at the same time. In The Assassin's first episode, we unravel the tangled past between Julie and Edward, culminating in a finale where Julie must face up to her previous life choices. As it stands, it's unclear whether this gripping story will continue beyond its introductory season or remain a succinct miniseries.

Not even Lawrence's baggiest of baggy jeans could replace my lightweight lace-trimmed bottoms. Turns out, my denim antidote agrees with the celebrity style calendar. Lace-trimmed skirts and shorts have won over my favorite fashion muses for summer 2025, even Lawrence herself. Why now? ""They're the perfect mix of comfortable and polished for summer: lightweight, breathable, and effortlessly feminine,"" Micaela Erlanger, celebrity stylist to Kelly Clarkson and Lupita Nyong'o, tells me over email. Erlanger credits lace's popularity to the revival of '90s nostalgia. ""It's all about softness, texture, and ease,"" three themes still dominating '90s-esque minimalism today.

At Glastonbury, the actor's lace barely peeked out from underneath an oversize band tee, a tomboy-ish duo beloved by fashion girls everywhere. While the trends are similar, Erlanger says shorts versus skirts give off totally different energies. ""Shorts are more playful and cool, with that off-duty, easygoing vibe, while skirts feel romantic and polished."" So, be sure to style accordingly. Wearing a skirt?
