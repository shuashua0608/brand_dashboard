n3ez8zd,"â€‰ I'm almost finished with my first HaruHaru Wonder sunscreen (Airyfit) and I love it. I have tried everything from La Roche Posay, Elta MD (one of my favs though pricey), multiple Supergoop (no longer purchase this brand, see lawsuit), Neutrogena, Elf, Bum (something or other), Beauty of Joseon and more. So far my recent favorite is the HaruHaru Wonder Airyfit. I sadly purchased from Amazon so was extremely concerned I may have purchased a fake, I decided to do an all day wear test at the beach the other week. I used four different sunscreens (1 on each bottom half wrist/arm, left a gap in the middle for reference, 1 on each top part of my forearm). I used Elta MD Daily Tinted, Neutrogena Sport spf 70 (happened to have though don't really use), HaruHaru Wonder Airyfit and leftover Supergoop Play. It seems HaruHaru was in the lead with Elta MD, for being the lightest part(s) of the tested areas. Of course this is not a scientific test, though a visual to give me some idea as to how well they actually protect me. Hope this helps!","I'm almost finished with my first HaruHaru Wonder sunscreen (Airyfit) and I love it.
