urn:li:ugcPost:7352630194085462016,"  Dear Amazon Team, I am writing to escalate a serious issue with my recent order (407-2425834-9690711), Register contact no - +918169693727 I had ordered Optimum Nutrition (ON) Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder 5 lbs, 2.27 kgs (Double Rich Chocolate) but I received 2KG of wheat flour (aata) instead — a completely unrelated and incorrect product. I had raised a complaint immediately, but to my shock, it was closed with the conclusion that I received the correct item. This is incorrect and unacceptable. I have photographic proof clearly showing that I received a grocery item instead of whey protein. This is not just a customer service failure — it feels like fraud. I request that this issue be re-opened, thoroughly investigated, and resolved with either a full refund or replacement at the earliest. I feel like telling me that I got the correct order instead of investigating the matter correctly is a huge flaw of this customer service. I tried to convey this to the customer service team via phone but they simply hung up to phone on me multiple times.The last 2 complaints team reps who disconnected my call was Rahul which was around 2'o clock and then Parag who I informed and requested not to disconnected the call after telling my previous experience but he also did the same things. This is disappointing to say the least and getting really frustrated now that I've no where to go for help. Please escalate this to the  grievance/redressal officer and respond urgently.
