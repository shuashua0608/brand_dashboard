We've been swooning over the bag ever since, so we had to track down this to copy the look. Earlier this spring, Lohan looking like she just walked out of a Polly Pocket summer dream. Her look? A lavender mini dress, pink oval Celine sunglasses, clear PVC Chanel heels, Anita Ko gold statement earrings and a tweed Chanel bag. Her designer pick is almost impossible to find (and afford), but thankfully, this isn't. Get the for just at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication but are subject to change. Channeling Chanel's signature preppy charm, this bag is made with a structured silhouette, a tweed fabric and luxe gold hardware. It has a chic chain strap to cleverly doubles as both a shoulder bag and a crossbody. It comes in a bright sorbet-pink tweed-like fabric (perfect for cute summer looks), along with two color-infused shades: white and black. From hair clips and lip gloss to compact mirrors and mini perfumes, this bag is roomy enough to fit all of your everyday must-have's. However, it's still compact enough to stay sleek and lightweight. With no inner pockets, you're free to organize the interior how you see fit. This luxe bag elevates your everyday style, whether you're wearing a flowy sundress or office-approved trousers. For brunch, you can pair it with a ruffled mini dress and kittens heels or with a crisp button-down and your go-to denim for drinks with the girls. Whether you're reviving Y2K style or simply want to add a pop of pink that feels luxurious for summer, this nails it. It has the same playfully pink energy Lohan brought to her look ‚Äî just without the five-figure price tag. No A-list budget required for this find, you can pick it up for just $28 on Amazon.
