0D107D4C3FB0303292D90C5F77497441,"  Are two-piece matching sets still trendy? I wanted to find one for a casual summer event, but then I wondered if that look had passed its prime. Yael, The Bronx   The coordinated ''set,'' known more colloquially as the co-ord set, that perfectly matching combination of top and bottom, has been part of the standard wardrobe for decades. What, after all, is a suit but a set with different vowels? It has, however, taken many forms over the years and has ebbed and flowed in the public consciousness. The last time sets really became a thing was in the fall of 2021, after the Miu Miu show during Paris Fashion Week. That's when Miuccia Prada showed matching khaki or gray pleated micro-miniskirts and cropped jacket tops or cable knits. Before you could say ''social media catnip,'' the Miu Miu set had gone stratospheric, worn by Nicole Kidman on the cover of Vanity Fair as well as influencers by the truckload. It was not, however, the first set, and it certainly won't be the last. The Juicy Couture tracksuit, beloved by Los Angeles denizens and celebrities everywhere in the early aughts, was a set. The fact that the aughts are currently enjoying a style renaissance, along with the whole set concept, is probably not a coincidence. Before that, Cher Horowitz's yellow plaid suit in ''Clueless'' was a set. In the 1920s, Coco Chanel loved a knit set, a coordinated cardigan and skirt inspired by clothing worn to play tennis and golf. Some historians trace the origins of the set back even further, to the 16th and 17th centuries, when men started wearing matching doublets and hose. As to why the set concept lasted so long, it's pretty simple. As the stylist Gabriella Karefa-Johnson told me when I asked, ''it makes life easier.'' You don't have to worry about coordinating your clothes because they are already coordinated. It makes you look pulled together with pretty much zero effort. And it makes packing simpler because you can wear the top and bottom together or apart. One drawback to the concept, Ms. Karefa-Johnson said, is that it can become a crutch of sorts, a way of ceding responsibility in the morning that can atrophy the taste muscle. And since dressing is in part about showing others who you are as an individual, it can act more like camouflage than self-expression. Samira Nasr, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, said she tended to stay away from sets because she preferred looking ''as though something is a little off'' and giving her clothes an idiosyncrasy that is uniquely hers. And judging by recent debuts of new designers at big brands, like Michael Rider at Celine, with its mismatched classics, that kind of idiosyncrasy may be on the rise. But here's the thing about sets: You can always disaggregate the pieces and turn them into separates -- you can always mix and unmatch them -- and then re-aggregate according to taste. In that light, investing in a set is not being trendy. It's being smart.Every week in the Open Thread newsletter, The Times's chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, answers a reader's fashion-related question.

mov_030B1BA4A2C133EEA998699DCB371049,"  SPR_COMBO[id]Suara.com - Hubungan asmara El Rumi dan Syifa Hadju kembali mencuri perhatian publik. Kali ini, putra Maia Estianty itu menunjukkan sisi romantisnya dengan memberikan kejutan istimewa untuk ulang tahun sang kekasih, yang genap berusia 25 tahun pada Minggu (13/7/2025) kemarin. Tak hanya mengunggah foto-foto mesra mereka berdua di Instagram, El Rumi juga menuliskan pesan manis untuk Syifa Hadju yang membuat warganet ikut terbawa suasana. ""Selamat ulang tahun untuk cinta dalam kehidupanku, @syifahadju,"" tulis El dalam caption unggahannya, yang dikutip Suara.com pada Senin (14/7/2025). Dalam pesan lanjutannya, adik Al Ghazali itu menyampaikan doa tulus agar Syifa Hadju selalu dikelilingi kebahagiaan. Ia pun mengungkap rasa syukurnya karena masih bisa menjalani hari-hari bersama wanita yang ia sayangi. Syifa Hadju, bagi El Rumi adalah sosok yang menurutnya membuat cinta terasa “aman, sejati, dan menyenangkan sekaligus.” ""Kamu adalah cinta dalam bentuk yang paling... dan aku berterima kasih kepada alam semesta setiap hari untukmu. Ini untuk merayakan hari ini dan selalu. Sekali lagi, selamat ulang tahun, Bebe,"" tulis El Rumi, penuh cinta. Namun yang paling menyita perhatian publik adalah kejutan spesial dari El Rumi di hari ulang tahun Syifa Hadju. Dalam unggahan Instagram Story, tampak pria 26 tahun tersebut datang membawa kue ulang tahun dan sebuket bunga. Tapi itu belum selesai. Momen saat Syifa Hadju membuka hadiah dari El Rumi juga terekam dan dibagikan oleh para sahabat mereka. Tak main-main putra musisi Ahmad Dhani tersebut menghadiahkan sebuah tas mewah Chanel 25 Small Handbag Grained Calfskin Gild Tone Metal Gold White, yang diketahui bernilai fantastis: Rp106.700.000! Momen ini pun langsung jadi bahan perbincangan netizen, khususnya di akun Instagram @outfit.syifahadju. Komentar-komentar penuh kekaguman dan doa pun membanjiri: Baca Juga: Syifa Hadju Ulang Tahun ke-25, El Rumi Beri Hadiah Tembus Ratusan Juta Rupiah ""Keren El Rumi, emang laki-laki tulus dan sesayang itu sama bebenya G,"" tulis akun @and****.

""Cippa mencintai dan dicintai secara ugal-ugalan,"" tambah @nob**** yang langsung jadi komentar favorit. Chemistry pasangan ini memang kerap membuat iri warganet.

Alden Allen and Elise Lacret* Bebe Buell turns 72 today, and the rock & roll grand dame has never been more vital. Or more appreciative of her time on this planet. Last summer, the singer, songwriter, and model was diagnosed with breast cancer after a routine mammogram. She had a lumpectomy, and then a breast reduction, before embarking on a holistic journey to regain her health. Buell succeeded and is presently showing no signs of cancer seven months after her surgery. On Monday, she celebrates her resilience, while taking stock of the temporary nature of life, with the release of her new song and video “Skin Suit.” Buell delivers the gothic rock ballad, which she co-wrote with producer Greg Lattimer and her husband and creative partner, Jim Wallerstein, with gravitas, grace, and good ol' fashioned theatricality. While her “skin suit” may be her very flesh and blood, she considers it no more important than the haute couture in her closet. “This is just my skin suit/Hanging next to my Manuel,” she sings, cheekily name-checking the Nashville tailor famous for his rhinestoned creations. In the next line, Buell says she stores her “skin suit” next to “my Coco Chanel.” “The 'skin suit' is the physical body. It's not our soul. It's what we use to be on this earth,” Buell tells Rolling Stone. “I had the title and I had the chorus in my head whirling around. And then after I got my diagnosis, it was almost like something channeled. I put my pen to a piece of paper and it literally just poured out of me exactly as I sing it.” Despite its connection to her cancer battle, Buell is reluctant to describe “Skin Suit” as a survivor story. “It's a warrior story, because I am a warrior that is not going to be killed in battle,” she says. “I'm being very Joan of Arc about this.” In the video, directed by Alden Allen and Elise Lacret, Buell — in her Manuel pants and jacket — performs the song in front of an unfolding galaxy of stars. Long after she was famously photographed in the Seventies in a Creem T-shirt and little else, she embraces her decades. “I'm trying to age gracefully and show people that you can be very alive and very on the road to healing at all ages. And music is healing,” she says. Trending Stories Documents Show FEMA Calls Went Unanswered.

mov_F2B67C24CC4651940F56EC354E00D1CE,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Kylie Jenner brazenly copied one of her Hollywood idols - Jennifer Lopez - while on a luxury vacation on a yacht in Greece last week. The 27-year-old reality TV star added something to her look that she usually doesn't have on. The Kylie Cosmetics founder wore a gold anklet on her one of her ankles, a thing Lopez has been doing for decades. And Jenner also added large hoop earrings in gold, which is one of JLo's signature moves. Lopez is a longtime friend of the Kardashian family as she is pals with Kim and Khloe. And she has also attended Kris Jenner's Christmas Eve party in Hidden Hills, California. The girlfriend of Timothee Chalamet had on a sleeveless ivory gown with a slit up the front and added strappy black heels. She was heading out to dinner on shore with her best pal, Stassie Karanikolaou, aka as Stassie Baby. Kylie did not mention Lopez in her caption but instead kept her wording extremely brief.  ' Greeeece,' the mom of two captioned her update. Most of the pinup shots were of Kylie in bikinis. In the first image, The Kardashians star wore a tiny yellow and black Chanel string bikini as she sat on her knees on the yacht. Kylie tipped her head to one side in the shot and looked like she was rolling her eyes. In another snap, the reality TV star showered off as she climbed back onto the boat after a swim in the sea. In another photo, Kylie poured herself into a tiny leopard print bikini that highlighted her toned figure. Kylie turned up the heat with a photo of herself leaning against the railing of the yacht in a skin tight, curve hugging white dress. Other photos in the group included a shot of five women's feet in flip flops, a photo of her pink Chanel tote bag and a bunch of nature shots. Khloé Kardashian commented on her sister's post: 'Are you ever coming home?' A fan also mentioned seeing her on the yacht, writing, 'We saw your yacht in paxos!!! We drove past on a boat. hope ur having the best time.' A bunch of other fans commented along the lines of 'Oh girl your life is so fun' and 'what a life.' And many others complimented her beauty with comments such as 'How is someone this perfect' and 'sun-kissed beauty ❤️.' Kylie's trip to Greece comes after she introduced her collaboration with Frankie's Bikinis. The new swimwear collaboration is called Cloud Cups by Frankies Bikinis x KHY. 'I've always loved Frankies Bikinis, and I'm so excited to partner with them to create this collection – with incredibly flattering silhouettes in super soft material, these are the perfect pieces for summer,' Kylie told DailyMail.com in a statement. 'We've incorporated so many fun prints – from polka dots to leopard – and the styles are so comfortable, it feels like they float on your skin while lifting and sculpting. 'One of my favorite pieces is the Heavenly Satin top – the lace detail is so sweet, and it showcases the vintage aesthetic that this collection is all about.' 'Designing this collection with Kylie felt so natural, like two girls dreaming up their perfect swim drawer,' said Aiello, founder of Frankies Bikinis. 'We wanted each piece to lift, shape, and sculpt while wrapping the body in delicate support.' With six bikini top styles, bottoms that range from classic strings to fuller-coverage, and sun dresses and separates, Frankies Bikinis x KHY offers styles for every aesthetic. Beyond swim, Frankies Bikinis x KHY expands into limited edition mini dresses and easy separates. 'KHY aims to redefine the modern wardrobe by offering edited collections that seamlessly blends luxury with everyday style, spanning a diverse range of categories and styles. 'By collaborating with iconic brands and global designers, we hope that KHY will be a platform that delivers access to incredible fashion for everyone,' the company said in a statement. Frankies Bikinis is a female-led lifestyle brand recognized for its on-trend designs, innovative fabrics, and a commitment to crafting styles that make women feel more confident. Founded by mother-daughter duo Mimi and Francesca Aiello in their Malibu home in 2012, the brand has since grown into an internationally recognized company.","Have YOU got a story?

mov_B46E1ED64F1E7438124E51AB06608491,"  NEED TO KNOW Rihanna and her kids dressed to impress in designer outfits for the Smurfs premiere in Los Angeles on July 13 The singer, who is expecting her third baby with A$AP Rocky, wore Saint Laurent while her sons, Riot and RZA, wore bespoke Dior Since announcing her pregnancy at the 2025 Met Gala, Rihanna has been taking on a new category of maternity red carpet style Fashion runs deep in Rihanna's household. On Sunday, July 13, the singer brought her two sons, RZA, 3 and Riot, 23 months, for a special night out at the Smurfs premiere in Los Angeles. While the evening was a celebration of Rihanna's new acting gig — she voices Smurfette in the animated film — it also turned into a runway show once the trio stepped onto the carpet. The 37-year-old Fenty Beauty founder, who is expecting her third child with A$AP Rocky, made a statement in a bump-baring Saint Laurent Fall 2025 gown with lace cups, a full skirt and an olive green ribbon cinching her waist. She teamed it with a leather moto jacket and pink glam topped with a high bun.

The performer wasn't the only one stunting fresh-off-the-runway styles though. Turns out, her little ones were also dressed to the nines in miniature menswear looks drawn directly from Jonathan Anderson's first collection for Dior Homme, which debuted on June 27 during Paris Men's Fashion Week. Riot wore a custom toddler's version of one of Anderson's ensembles that featured a green single-breasted jacket, a white shirt with a matching bow tie and flared white shorts. Although, the model's fisherman sandals were traded out for adorable oxford shoes. RZA's outfit — which comprised of a pink button-up shirt and tie and dark green cargo pants — appeared to be an interpretation of one of the Dior runway designs. Arnold Jerocki/Getty Rihanna and A$AP Rocky at the ""Smurfs"" global premiere in Brussels on June 28, 2025 The family cuteness didn't stop at the three's coordinating looks. They shared many sweet moments during the event, including when RZA and Riot had a chance to meet Papa Smurf. During the interaction, the toddlers beamed with excitement as they were introduced to the famous Smurf character. Since announcing the news of her growing family at the 2025 Met Gala, Rihanna has not stopped showing up and showing out across the globe. She first kicked off the press tour for Smurfs in late June at the movie's global premiere in Brussels. She stepped out alongside Rocky, 36, who she was confirmed to be dating in 2020.

Download it now for the most binge-worthy celeb content, exclusive video clips, astrology updates and more! Rihanna mixed method dressing with maternity style in a sheer baby blue Chanel gown designed with an embellished peplum top that revealed her bump. The ""Sundress"" rapper repped a hint of blue on his tie, but kept the rest of his look subdued with a pinstripe button-up and black slacks. Before that, the couple, in addition to Riot, attended Paris Fashion Week in support of his brand AWGE's Spring/Summer 2026 show. Rihanna again proved her cool mom status in a preppy skin-baring look featuring a nearly unbuttoned striped shirt, pleated skirt and stilettos with socks.

The insider added: ""They've really embraced this chapter and their bond has only deepened since becoming parents.""","NEED TO KNOW Rihanna and her kids dressed to impress in designer outfits for the Smurfs premiere in Los Angeles on July 13 The singer, who is expecting her third baby with A$AP Rocky, wore Saint Laurent while her sons, Riot and RZA, wore bespoke Dior Since announcing her pregnancy at the 2025 Met Gala, Rihanna has been taking on a new category of maternity red carpet style Fashion runs deep in Rihanna's household. On Sunday, July 13, the singer brought her two sons, RZA, 3 and Riot, 23 months, for a special night out at the Smurfs premiere in Los Angeles. While the evening was a celebration of Rihanna's new acting gig — she voices Smurfette in the animated film — it also turned into a runway show once the trio stepped onto the carpet. The 37-year-old Fenty Beauty founder, who is expecting her third child with A$AP Rocky, made a statement in a bump-baring Saint Laurent Fall 2025 gown with lace cups, a full skirt and an olive green ribbon cinching her waist. She teamed it with a leather moto jacket and pink glam topped with a high bun.

The performer wasn't the only one stunting fresh-off-the-runway styles though. Turns out, her little ones were also dressed to the nines in miniature menswear looks drawn directly from Jonathan Anderson's first collection for Dior Homme, which debuted on June 27 during Paris Men's Fashion Week. Riot wore a custom toddler's version of one of Anderson's ensembles that featured a green single-breasted jacket, a white shirt with a matching bow tie and flared white shorts. Although, the model's fisherman sandals were traded out for adorable oxford shoes. RZA's outfit — which comprised of a pink button-up shirt and tie and dark green cargo pants — appeared to be an interpretation of one of the Dior runway designs. Arnold Jerocki/Getty Rihanna and A$AP Rocky at the ""Smurfs"" global premiere in Brussels on June 28, 2025 The family cuteness didn't stop at the three's coordinating looks. They shared many sweet moments during the event, including when RZA and Riot had a chance to meet Papa Smurf. During the interaction, the toddlers beamed with excitement as they were introduced to the famous Smurf character. Since announcing the news of her growing family at the 2025 Met Gala, Rihanna has not stopped showing up and showing out across the globe. She first kicked off the press tour for Smurfs in late June at the movie's global premiere in Brussels. She stepped out alongside Rocky, 36, who she was confirmed to be dating in 2020.

Rihanna mixed method dressing with maternity style in a sheer baby blue Chanel gown designed with an embellished peplum top that revealed her bump. The ""Sundress"" rapper repped a hint of blue on his tie, but kept the rest of his look subdued with a pinstripe button-up and black slacks. Before that, the couple, in addition to Riot, attended Paris Fashion Week in support of his brand AWGE's Spring/Summer 2026 show. Rihanna again proved her cool mom status in a preppy skin-baring look featuring a nearly unbuttoned striped shirt, pleated skirt and stilettos with socks.

Rihanna put a fresh spin on a beloved silhouette — a crop top and low-rise bottom — with the white set by Alaïa's Pieter Mulier, per Vogue. The top's hood draped down into a high neckline, but left room for the singer's bold diamond earrings to peek through. The floor-length skirt featured a sculptural roll of padding around the waistband, creating a flared look at her hips. Rihanna completed the look with black rectangular shades and a stack of diamond bracelets. BACKGRID Rihanna on July 13.

mov_7FF3B66C777EBAE5656F10EF1591252E,"  Findings from YipitData show that TikTok Shop and Target are neck-and-neck by fragrance sales; Kayali is number one at Sephora, and more. July 15, 2025, 1:05am Macy's may be holding on to its longtime position as the top U.S. retailer by share of fragrance sales, but plenty of other shifts are afoot when it comes to who's winning the category. According to YipitData, Macy's accounted for 31.8 percent of fragrance sales during the month of May, indicating a 14.7-point lead from the category's next-biggest retailer during the period, Ulta Beauty. While significant, that lead is several points less than it was, say, two years prior in 2023, when Macy's accounted for more than 40 percent of fragrance sales during the same month. This shift is in part due to the nascent growth of alternative fragrance retailers as formidable competitors in the space. There's Amazon, which, per YipitData, accounted for 14.9 percent of fragrance sales in May across the platform's first- and third-party sellers (tracking after Sephora, which accounted for 15.5 percent during the same period). TikTok Shop, too, wasn't on the map at all in the U.S. until halfway through 2023, yet today the e-tailer — which has propelled brands from Lattafa to Phlur to virality — goes head-to-head with Target in terms of share of fragrance sales, actually outpacing Target slightly in May. Year-to-date, the top three fragrance brands at Sephora have been Kayali, Sol de Janeiro and YSL Beauty, in that order. For the month of May, Valentino overtook YSL for the number-three spot, while in April, Chanel's Chance Eau Splendide Eau de Parfum was the retailer's top-selling new stock keeping unit across the store. On Amazon, which YipitData reports has gained modest but steady share in fragrance since 2023, winning brands range from value-driven to designer, a dynamic which the platform's top two brands in May — Lattafa and Versace — quintessentially represent. Other top 10 brands on Amazon include Sol de Janeiro, Nautica and Dior (which, like all brands owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, does not officially sell on the platform). So far in 2025, fragrance has been the fastest-growing category in beauty, as has been the case since 2021. According to Circana, the category grew 4 percent in the prestige market and 8 percent in mass during the first quarter of this year.

mov_1657B39EB1BF61BFF8B049E272B441E0,"  Created by Valentina Li in collaboration with the Chanel Makeup Creation Studio, the Les Beiges – Golden Hour Collection transforms transient beauty into an everyday ritual of radiance. Drawing inspiration from the ever-changing hues of the sky at sunrise and sunset, the collection offers a warm, summery colour story designed to reflect — and refract — the golden hour ' s softest light. Radiant pinks, muted corals and glowing copper tones mirror the sun ' s daily dance across the skyline, capturing the mood of the moment in formulas that are both luminous and wearable. Complexion: At the heart of the collection lies the Les Beiges Healthy Golden Glow Powder, a duo of finely-milled powders embossed with a sunset motif. Available in Éclat du Soir (a satin pink and shimmery rose gold) and Soleil Couchant (a soft orange paired with coppery bronze), each pairing enhances the complexion with a light-infused glow. The texture is imperceptibly fine, blending seamlessly into the skin to leave it glowing, as if kissed by the last light of day. Complementing this is the Les Beiges Healthy Glow Sheer Colour Stick, returning in two new radiant shades: Reset, a golden orange shimmer, and Refresh, a luminous satin pink. Swiped across cheeks or layered for intensity, these blush sticks melt into the skin for a dewy, sunkissed flush. Eyes: For the eyes, Chanel reinterprets its iconic Les Beiges Healthy Glow Natural Eyeshadow Palette in a new harmony, Golden — a flurry of hues echoing the changing tones of the sky. From rose gold and luminous copper to matte mauve and rosewood, each shade is designed to softly sculpt and highlight, whether for a wash of daytime elegance or a deeper dusk-time drama. Lips: Completing the collection is a quartet of new shades of Rouge Coco Flash, infusing lips with a touch of colour and a veil of light. Sun Bliss offers a golden pinkish beige, Sunset a rich pink sienna, and Sun Kiss a luminous cool pink — each designed to add a veil of warm-toned polish to every golden hour look. chanel.com The post appeared first on A&E Magazine .","Created by Valentina Li in collaboration with the Chanel Makeup Creation Studio, the Les Beiges – Golden Hour Collection transforms transient beauty into an everyday ritual of radiance.

mov_1345FE6B81168EE9FF6AF4F95869D2EF,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Kylie Jenner fans think her A Complete Unknown actor beau Timothee Chalamet is secretly with her on yacht vacation in Greece. That is because a man in black briefs was spotted resting on a seashore in one of her latest Instagram posts shared on Tuesday. 'That guy on the shore is Timothee,' said one fan on X while another piped up: 'He is secretly with her in Greece, I feel it in my bones.' The couple were last photographed together in St Tropez in the south of France on July 5. On the luxury trip Jenner was modeling a white, leopard print and polka dot swimsuit from her Frankies Bikinis/Khy collaboration while on a very large yacht. Also on the getaway with the 27-year-old reality TV star were her kids Stormi and Aire that she has with rapper ex Travis Scott. And her pal Stassie Karanikolaou, aka as Stassie Baby, was also spied during the European holiday. Rumors of their relationship between Jenner and Chalamet began circulating in April 2023, following the makeup mogul's split from Scott. They were first spotted together publicly in September 2023 at Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour concert. The couple then made their first official public appearance together at the U.S. Open in September 2023. 'Greeeece,' the mom of two captioned her update. Most of the pinup shots were of Kylie in bikinis. In the first image, The Kardashians star wore a tiny yellow and black Chanel string bikini as she sat on her knees on the yacht. Kylie tipped her head to one side in the shot and looked like she was rolling her eyes. In another snap, the reality TV star showered off as she climbed back onto the boat after a swim in the sea. In another photo, Kylie poured herself into a tiny leopard print bikini that highlighted her toned figure. Kylie turned up the heat with a photo of herself leaning against the railing of the yacht in a skin tight, curve hugging white dress. Other photos in the group included a shot of five women's feet in flip flops, a photo of her pink Chanel tote bag and a bunch of nature shots. Khloé Kardashian commented on her sister's post: 'Are you ever coming home?' A fan also mentioned seeing her on the yacht, writing, 'We saw your yacht in paxos!!! We drove past on a boat. hope ur having the best time.' A bunch of other fans commented along the lines of 'Oh girl your life is so fun' and 'what a life.' And many others complimented her beauty with comments such as 'How is someone this perfect' and 'sun-kissed beauty ❤️.' Kylie's trip to Greece comes after she introduced her collaboration with Frankie's Bikinis. The new swimwear collaboration is called Cloud Cups by Frankies Bikinis x KHY. 'I've always loved Frankies Bikinis, and I'm so excited to partner with them to create this collection – with incredibly flattering silhouettes in super soft material, these are the perfect pieces for summer,' Kylie told DailyMail.com in a statement. 'We've incorporated so many fun prints – from polka dots to leopard – and the styles are so comfortable, it feels like they float on your skin while lifting and sculpting. 'One of my favorite pieces is the Heavenly Satin top – the lace detail is so sweet, and it showcases the vintage aesthetic that this collection is all about.' 'Designing this collection with Kylie felt so natural, like two girls dreaming up their perfect swim drawer,' said Aiello, founder of Frankies Bikinis. 'We wanted each piece to lift, shape, and sculpt while wrapping the body in delicate support.' With six bikini top styles, bottoms that range from classic strings to fuller-coverage, and sun dresses and separates, Frankies Bikinis x KHY offers styles for every aesthetic. Beyond swim, Frankies Bikinis x KHY expands into limited edition mini dresses and easy separates. 'KHY aims to redefine the modern wardrobe by offering edited collections that seamlessly blends luxury with everyday style, spanning a diverse range of categories and styles. 'By collaborating with iconic brands and global designers, we hope that KHY will be a platform that delivers access to incredible fashion for everyone,' the company said in a statement. Frankies Bikinis is a female-led lifestyle brand recognized for its on-trend designs, innovative fabrics, and a commitment to crafting styles that make women feel more confident. Founded by mother-daughter duo Mimi and Francesca Aiello in their Malibu home in 2012, the brand has since grown into an internationally recognized company.","Have YOU got a story?

Jennie在嘴巴裡大跳時穿著的桃心領束胸上衣，簡直讓他氣場全開，還不忘加入Chanel 2007推出的特殊款頸鏈，這看來衝突的畫面反而特別適合這支MV。 Rosé賽車外套

作為MV主視覺的Jump造型裡，四人以不同顏色的Jump上衣，個別加諸不同巧思，Jisoo手上的Martine Rose袖套成為搶眼細節，從Jennie的褲腰帶上能發現Chanel的加持，Lisa則繫上了Louis Vuitton的腰帶。 Ending漂浮舞台造型

mov_41BE45CE71F9929B1FDDF938DAAA9A99,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Kylie Jenner showed off her bare face in a sweet makeup tutorial with daughter Stormi, as she revealed the lesson she taught her little one about natural beauty. The lipkit mogul, 27, shared an adorable video with the seven-year-old on Tuesday as they filmed a 'get ready with me' while vacationing in Greece. During the clip, Kylie — who was using Kylie Cosmetics products in the video — revealed the crucial natural beauty lesson she imparted to her daughter. 'Mommy always tells you, though, you're the most beautiful without...' she said, trailing off, as Stormi completed the sentence, stating, 'Makeup.' 'Yes,' Kylie — who recently stunned fans with a 'nasty looking' plastic surgery scar from a breast augmentation — responded. 'Our first GRWM together we always make vids together for fun and i never post them but this was just tooooo cute, ' Kylie — who shares Stormi and son Aire, three, with ex Travis Scott, 34 — captioned the clip. Timothée Chalamet's girlfriend started out the clip showing off her natural features while wearing a plush cream robe. 'It's Stormi,' Kylie playfully started out the clip, jokingly switching out their names, after Stormi introduced herself as Kylie. 'We're gonna do our first-ever makeup tutorial together,' Kylie went on, revealing that they were going to start with the Kylie Cosmetics Lip Butter. 'Really glossy,' Stormi remarked, after smacking her lips. Stormi then moved on to the blush as Kylie put on her foundation. The proud mom then explained how her little one enjoys makeup. 'Stormi likes to play with my makeup sometimes, but obviously, she doesn't wear makeup yet,' the mom-of-two said. The duo then went on to apply mascara before adding concealer. Stormi then spoke about having fun on the luxury vacation. 'We are in Greece. I love the boat that we were on. I love the food. I love the water. The water's so warm,' she sweetly shared. Kylie then asked if Stormi liked 'having sleepovers with Mommy every night' to which she replied 'yes.' Stormi then showed off how she applied 'Mommy's dewy balm' as Kylie laughed and said 'You're so cute.' The two went on to apply blush, with Kylie choosing a mix of Summer Sorbet and Ladybug, and Stormi opting for Cheeky Mood. Kylie then applied her lip liner, as Stormi declared, 'Now, we're just waiting for Mommy to finish!' Earlier this week Kylie shared a video of her and Stormi dancing around in circles on a yacht while wearing robes with towels on their heads. She called her daughter her 'built-in-bestie for life.' She also shared the video to TikTok where she captioned it, 'can't see our haters from here.' She also shared videos of Stormi arriving in Greece. Kylie cheekily captioned that video, 'I want to be her.' Later she posted a video of Stormi going down the huge slide off the yacht into the sea. Kylie's girls' trip included four friends, among them her bestie, 28-year-old Stassie Karanikolaou. She shared a carousel of images earlier on Sunday of her time with the adults on the yacht. 'Greeeece,' the mom of two captioned that update. In the first image, The Kardashians star wore a tiny yellow and black Chanel string bikini as she sat on her knees on the yacht. In another snap, the reality TV star showered off as she climbed back onto the boat after a swim in the sea. Khloé Kardashian commented on her sister's post: 'Are you ever coming home?' Many of Jenner's fans think her A Complete Unknown actor beau Timothee is secretly with her on the yacht vacation. That is because a man in black briefs was spotted resting on a seashore in one of her latest Instagram posts shared on Tuesday. 'That guy on the shore is Timothee,' said one fan on X while another piped up: 'He is secretly with her in Greece, I feel it in my bones.' The couple were last photographed together in St Tropez in the south of France on July 5.","Have YOU got a story?

mov_B1A1B9894E7C126EA2B6857C84DD6681,"  T his season, Paris Haute Couture Week unfolded with a rare emotional intensity tinged with farewells, steeped in theatricality, and grounded in masterful craftsmanship. From Demna's final bow at Balenciaga to Daniel Roseberry's golden surrealism at Schiaparelli, the Fall/Winter 2025 collections revealed fashion at its most transcendent. Balenciaga: Demna's swansong All eyes were on Balenciaga for what was confirmed as Demna's final couture collection for the house. The Georgian designer closed this chapter with restraint and poetry, stripping away the irony that defined his earlier years. The silhouettes were sharply architectural but softened with sweeping cloaks, delicate veils, and a palette of moody neutrals. A standout moment was a floor-length coat that was constructed entirely from repurposed opera gloves, a quiet metaphor for legacy and transformation. Schiaparelli: Gold-drenched dreams At Schiaparelli, Daniel Roseberry leaned unapologetically into fantasy. The collection was a gilded dreamscape, with impossibly cinched waists, structured surrealist bodices, and embroidery inspired by celestial maps. A sculptural gold bustier molded like molten armour stole the show, echoing Elsa Schiaparelli's historic love of the otherworldly. Roseberry's strength lies in making the improbable seem inevitable, and this season was no exception. Maison Margiela: Galliano's theatrical reverie John Galliano returned to the Margiela runway with another avant-garde opera of texture, shadow, and emotion. The show was held at midnight in an abandoned Parisian ballroom, where models emerged like haunted muses in deconstructed ballgowns, feathers soaked in ink, and corsetry layered over raw silks. The collection was both disturbing and divine, and as much of a performance piece as it is couture. Iris van Herpen: A return to the ethereal unknown Making a much-anticipated return to the physical runway, Iris van Herpen unveiled a collection that pushed the limits of form and futurism. Inspired by bioluminescent sea creatures and celestial structures, her creations hovered between nature and technology. Dresses crafted from laser-cut organza and 3D-printed filaments shimmered with otherworldly light, while one kinetic bodice appeared to breathe with the body itself. In a week ruled by emotion and legacy, van Herpen offered a glimpse into a future where couture is an extension of evolution itself. Chanel: A reimagined romance At the Grand Palais Éphémère, Chanel presented a collection that nodded to its codes while reaching for something more nuanced. Virginie Viard played with dualities – masculine-feminine, hard-soft – with boucle suiting reimagined as sweeping coatdresses and soft tulle paired with structured leather. While subdued, the collection whispered of evolution, not reinvention , and hinted at a possible turning point for the Maison's next chapter. Armani Privé: Liquid elegance Armani Privé delivered a masterclass in fluidity. Draped silks and sequined gowns shimmered like water under moonlight, with a colour story that moved from moonstone silver to deep sapphire. The pieces felt effortless, though every fold was deliberate. The atmosphere was serene and the craftsmanship flawless, which served as a reminder that quiet elegance never goes out of style .

mov_B0C22F70065E2F650BB5D7E4EDF7D43A,"  Academy Award-winning actor Lupita Nyong'o headlines the fifth season of Chanel Connects, the luxury house's flagship arts and culture podcast, alongside Royal Ballet principal dancer Francesca Hayward and artist Allison Katz. The new season, which launchs July 16 on Spotify, YouTube Music, and Apple Podcasts, explores themes of home through intimate conversations recorded at La Pausa, Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel's newly restored French Riviera villa that once hosted 20th century luminaries including Salvador Dalí, Jean Cocteau, and Misia Sert. Tribeca Festival and Chanel Announce 2025 Artist Awards Program Participants CalArts, Chanel Launch Center for Artists and Tech With AI Focus Tilda Swinton, Apichatpong Weerasethakul Join Forces for Chanel's Asian Cinema Initiatives “Gabrielle Chanel's villa, La Pausa, was a home of extraordinary creativity, where ideas evolved naturally among the olive groves and lavender. It's a perfect setting for the fifth season of Chanel Connects, which was recorded within the very rooms where Salvador Dali created 11 paintings, Misia Sert triumphed on the piano, and Jean Cocteau crafted his poetry,” said Yana Peel, president of arts, culture and heritage at Chanel. “This season, we hear from today's creative pioneers. Through a series of conversations, they discuss what's new and next in culture.” Nyong'o, who serves as a Chanel House ambassador, opens the season in conversation with philosopher Emanuele Coccia, author of “Philosophy of the Home,” exploring how concepts of home have evolved in the digital age. The Oscar winner, who has lived in Kenya, Mexico, and the U.S., reflects on her relationship to place: “I've adapted and grown with the places I've called home.” She also shares her perspective on storytelling's power, noting that “stories have the power to be a momentary home.” Episode two pairs Hayward with artist Allison Katz, whose work is held in collections including London's Tate Modern and Los Angeles' Hammer Museum. The duo discusses parallels between dance and painting, with Hayward offering her take on technology's role in performance: “In a world of AI, you can't replace real life performance.” Katz, meanwhile, speaks to artistic risk-taking: “It's important to risk my own story to get at something that goes beyond it.” The season continues with New Yorker writer Lauren Collins joining performance art duo Gerard & Kelly to explore dance language and the legacy of Americans on the French Riviera. Gerard & Kelly reflect on artistic evolution, suggesting that “maybe that's how art moves forward, in the blind spots,” while Collins observes that “somehow we always tell our own story through our work.” Michelin-starred chef Mauro Colagreco, who is also a UNESCO Goodwill Ambassador, connects with Paris-based artist Matthew Lutz-Kinoy in episode four. The conversation centers on creative ecology, with both artists drawing from their French surroundings while maintaining connections to their respective Argentine and international backgrounds. The season concludes with American artist Adam Pendleton in conversation with Peel herself, examining how technology will shape art's future. Pendleton, whose work was recently acquired by MoMA and featured at the Hirshhorn, also discusses his passion project preserving Nina Simone's childhood home. Chanel Connects is produced as part of the Chanel Culture Fund, which supports a network of creators and innovators through various programs including Art Partners, the Chanel Next Prize, and partnerships with institutions from CalArts to the Venice Biennale. The podcast amplifies voices across disciplines and generations, tackling contemporary cultural issues while honoring Chanel's century-long commitment to the arts.

mov_CD39EFC9B1C62FC2C32CE248253F902A,"  SPR_COMBO[de]psychologie, die verkauft, 16. Juli 2025 Eine verranzte Tasche bringt 10 Millionen Dollar bei einer Auktion - Was Unternehmen daraus lernen müssen 10 Millionen Dollar. Für eine gebrauchte Handtasche. Verkratzt, verranzt - und vermutlich mit einem ganz eigenen Geruchscocktail aus altem Leder, Parfümresten und konservierter Zeitgeschichte. Was für viele nach Wahnsinn klingt, ist für Verkaufspsychologen ein glasklares Signal: Story gepaart mit Verknappung verkauft. Am 10. Juli 2025 wurde in Paris das erste Exemplar der legendären Hermès Birkin Bag versteigert. Die Tasche gehörte Jane Birkin persönlich - der britisch-französischen Schauspielerin, Sängerin und Stil-Ikone, nach der das Modell benannt ist. Innerhalb weniger Minuten stieg das Bietgefecht auf 10 Millionen Dollar. Der Käufer: Valuence-CEO Shinsuke Sakimoto. Seine Begründung: ""Es geht nicht um Mode. Es geht um Geschichte."" Und genau da liegt der Kern: Menschen zahlen nicht für Produkte. Sie zahlen für Bedeutung. Vom Flugzeug-Kotztütchen zum Mythos Die Entstehungsgeschichte der Birkin Bag ist selbst ein Paradebeispiel für echtes Storytelling. 1984 saß Jane Birkin in einem Flugzeug neben dem damaligen Hermès-CEO Jean-Louis Dumas. Ihre Klage: ""Ich finde nie eine Tasche, in die alles reinpasst."" Dumas nahm eine Kotztüte - und kritzelte darauf den ersten Entwurf der Bag, die später nach ihr benannt wurde. Was folgte, war kein geplanter Marketing-Launch. Es entstand ein Mythos, der in Jahrzehnten immer weiter aufgeladen wurde: mit Wartelisten, limitierter Verfügbarkeit, Prominenz - und mit echtem psychologischen Sog. Und Mythen riechen nicht nach neuem Leder. Sie riechen nach Erinnerung, Geschichte und Nähe. Der Geruch des Begehrens In der Verkaufspsychologie zählt der Geruchssinn zu den stärksten emotionalen Triggern. Der Duft von altem Leder, getragen über Jahrzehnte von einer Stilikone, löst im limbischen System unmittelbare Reaktionen aus: Nostalgie, Faszination, Verbindung. Nicht trotz des Geruchs - sondern wegen ihm. Denn dieser Duft ist keine Parfümnote aus dem Hermès-Katalog. Es ist die olfaktorische Aura einer Ära: Zigarettenrauch in Pariser Cafés. Chanel N°5. Wildheit. Eleganz. Feminismus. 80er-Jahre. Eine Geschichte, konserviert im Geruch. Und genau das kaufen Sammler: Erlebbare Geschichte. Keine Funktion. Keine Frische. Was Unternehmen daraus lernen müssen Wer heute Kunden gewinnen will, braucht mehr als Qualität und Features. Er braucht eine Marke mit emotionaler Relevanz. Die Birkin Bag zeigt eindrucksvoll, wie stark Storytelling als Verkaufsgrund wirken kann - unabhängig von Branche oder Preisniveau. Es sind nicht die Materialien, die verkaufen. Es ist die Bedeutung dahinter. Erstens: Facts tell, Stories sell! Unternehmen müssen daher gezielt ihre Entstehungsgeschichten, Hintergründe oder Aha-Momente kommunizieren. Menschen kaufen, was sie spüren - nicht, was sie verstehen. Zweitens: Nostalgie wirkt. Der Rückgriff auf Herkunft, Retro-Anleihen oder handwerkliche Tradition aktiviert Vertrauen. Marken, die bewusst Geschichte oder Herkunft inszenieren, schaffen Identifikation - und heben sich in einem Meer aus glatten Werbeflächen deutlich ab....","SPR_COMBO[de]psychologie, die verkauft, 16.

mov_F4FD1649ECC90A06A1B2B43FA7A5C408,"  SPR_COMBO[de]psychologie, die verkauft, 16. Juli 2025 Eine verranzte Tasche bringt 10 Millionen Dollar bei einer Auktion - Was Unternehmen daraus lernen müssen 10 Millionen Dollar. Für eine gebrauchte Handtasche. Verkratzt, verranzt - und vermutlich mit einem ganz eigenen Geruchscocktail aus altem Leder, Parfümresten und konservierter Zeitgeschichte. Was für viele nach Wahnsinn klingt, ist für Verkaufspsychologen ein glasklares Signal: Story gepaart mit Verknappung verkauft. Am 10. Juli 2025 wurde in Paris das erste Exemplar der legendären Hermès Birkin Bag versteigert. Die Tasche gehörte Jane Birkin persönlich - der britisch-französischen Schauspielerin, Sängerin und Stil-Ikone, nach der das Modell benannt ist. Innerhalb weniger Minuten stieg das Bietgefecht auf 10 Millionen Dollar. Der Käufer: Valuence-CEO Shinsuke Sakimoto. Seine Begründung: ""Es geht nicht um Mode. Es geht um Geschichte."" Und genau da liegt der Kern: Menschen zahlen nicht für Produkte. Sie zahlen für Bedeutung. Vom Flugzeug-Kotztütchen zum Mythos Die Entstehungsgeschichte der Birkin Bag ist selbst ein Paradebeispiel für echtes Storytelling. 1984 saß Jane Birkin in einem Flugzeug neben dem damaligen Hermès-CEO Jean-Louis Dumas. Ihre Klage: ""Ich finde nie eine Tasche, in die alles reinpasst."" Dumas nahm eine Kotztüte - und kritzelte darauf den ersten Entwurf der Bag, die später nach ihr benannt wurde. Was folgte, war kein geplanter Marketing-Launch. Es entstand ein Mythos, der in Jahrzehnten immer weiter aufgeladen wurde: mit Wartelisten, limitierter Verfügbarkeit, Prominenz - und mit echtem psychologischen Sog. Und Mythen riechen nicht nach neuem Leder. Sie riechen nach Erinnerung, Geschichte und Nähe. Der Geruch des Begehrens In der Verkaufspsychologie zählt der Geruchssinn zu den stärksten emotionalen Triggern. Der Duft von altem Leder, getragen über Jahrzehnte von einer Stilikone, löst im limbischen System unmittelbare Reaktionen aus: Nostalgie, Faszination, Verbindung.

Kürzlich wurden die Erben des Walmart-Gründers wieder als die wohlhabendste Familie der Welt bezeichnet. Die Waltons sind wieder die reichste Familie der Welt.

Die Erben des US-Handelsunternehmens Walmart haben ihr Vermögen seit 2023 um 66 Prozent auf einen Rekordwert von 432 Milliarden Dollar (411 Milliarden Euro) gesteigert. Sie stehen nun wieder auf Platz 1 der jährlichen „Bloomberg“-Liste der reichsten Familien der Welt. Reichste Familie der Welt steigert ihr Vermögen: Die Walmart-Aktie legte eine Kursrally hin Den Waltons gehören gut 46 Prozent des größten Einzelhändlers der Welt mit rund 10.600 Filialen. Im Jahr 1962 hatte Firmengründer Sam Walton seinen ersten Supermarkt im US-Bundesstaat Arkansas eröffnet. Das Unternehmen schaffte in den Folgejahren ein rasantes Wachstum. Die Familie ist noch immer im Unternehmen tätig, wenn auch in zunehmend eingeschränktem Maße. Im vergangenen Jahr schied der Sohn des Gründers, Rob Walton, im Alter von 79 Jahren aus dem Aufsichtsrat aus. Sein Neffe war damit der einzig verbliebene Walton in dem Gremium. Der Grund für das neue Rekord-Vermögen: Die Walmart-Aktie hatte zuletzt eine Rekordrally hingelegt. Der Aktienkurs stieg im Laufe des Jahres um gut 80 Prozent. In der Folge überholte die Gründerfamilie die Herrscherfamilie von Abu Dhabi, die Al Nahyans. , die mit ihren weit verzweigten Investitionen auf Rang zwei abrutschten – mit 323,9 Milliarden Dollar Vermögen.

Email: poppy.gibson@mailonline.co.uk This is the shocking moment fitness influencer Grace Beverley had her vintage Chanel bag stolen outside a Notting Hill restaurant. The business owner, 28, was sat outside a popular Greek restaurant with her sister in the west London neighbourhood when a brazen thief sneakily swiped her bag from between her feet. The founder of activewear brand TALA  took to TikTok to share her frightening experience with her followers and explained she had always considered herself very vigilant. She explained she had been enjoying lunch with her sister when her vintage accessory was stolen from her  - despite being wedged between her feet. Grace relayed the theft in a video on Tuesday and said: 'I feel like I'm so observant and really really careful with my bag and phone in London but my whole bag just got robbed from between my feet at a restaurant. 'I was at Zephyr in Notting Hill, I was sat outside. My whole bag  - my bag was between my feet , squeezed between my feet and this man managed to get the whole thing.' She added: 'Me and my sister were talking about juicy gossip so I feel like that did get in the way but can you believe? My entire bag, my brand new , first ever, vintage Chanel is dead.' She then shared a clip from CCTV showing the exact moment a man stole her bag as she enjoyed her meal. In the clip, Grace and her sister could be seen chatting animatedly at a table outside while several people filed past. One man, wearing wearing a navy top and grey shorts with a matching grey cap, walked past and then reversed. With handfuls of shopping bags he came and sat down behind the influencer and his sibling, moving a chair and carefully placing his bags down around him. As the two girls continued their conversation, the thief reached down behind him, quickly snatching the bag and putting it inside a white tote bag before calmly walking out of the restaurant's seating area.

The third and final season of the Prime Video show, which premiered on July 16, will finally answer the question fans who haven't read Jenny Han's popular book series have been eager to find out: who will Isabella “Belly” Conklin end up with, Conrad Fisher, or his younger brother, Jeremiah? The two boys are played by Christopher Briney and Gavin Casalegno, respectively, and both actors are in committed relationships in real life. Briney has been dating his girlfriend, Isabel Machado, since 2021, and Casalegno hard-launched his wife, Cheyanne King Casalegno, after their November 2024 nuptials with a sweet post captioned, “FOREVER CAPTIVATED BY YOU️.” From Christopher Briney and Gavin Casalegno to leading actress Lola Tung, here's everything to know about the real-life loves of The Summer I Turned Pretty cast.

As far as who her character will end up with, Tung told Entertainment Tonight in June 2022 that she believes Belly will make the right choice for herself. ""I've always been Team Belly, and I believe that she should go with whoever she loves the most, whatever her heart [says],"" the actress shared. ""Follow her heart, see where it ends up.

n3flwix,"  For me, Opuntia by Saponificio Varesino is the very essence of what a classic masculine scent should be. Yeah, people say it's a Creed Aventus clone — I've heard that more times than I can count — but to me, it's a whole different story. There's something in it… a certain undertone, a whisper of something deeper. It hits a different string in the soul. It's not just fresh or elegant — it's composed. Confident. Like James Bond stepping into a room where he already knows he owns the space. This scent doesn't just smell good — it gives you something. A kind of internal shift. When I wear Opuntia, I stand a little taller, I move a little slower, like a man who's not in a rush to prove anything. Scent-wise, it's not the same, but the way it feels reminds me of Platinum Égoïste by Chanel. That same clean, controlled energy — sharp suit, calm presence, inner fire. Opuntia is more than a scent.

mov_5B010ACE97FDE810D22274BA4F0BB83A,"  In the ever-evolving world of fashion, where trends come and go with the seasons, one phenomenon has managed to remain at the center of attention—designer dupes. These are products that mimic high-end designer items but come at a fraction of the cost. From handbags and shoes to sunglasses and belts, designer dupes are everywhere, especially in the age of social media and online shopping. But what exactly makes them so popular, and why are they both loved and criticized? What Are Designer Dupes? Designer dupes refer to items that closely resemble designer products but are not direct counterfeits. They do not carry the original brand's logo or trademarks but imitate the style, design, and overall appearance. For example, a bag that looks like a Chanel flap bag but is branded under a different name with a similar structure would be considered a dupe rather than a fake. It's important to differentiate designer dupes from counterfeit goods. While counterfeit items are illegal and violate trademark laws by directly copying logos and names, dupes typically operate in a legal gray area. They offer the look for less without falsely claiming to be the real thing. The Demand for Luxury on a Budget One of the biggest reasons behind the surge in popularity of designer dupes is affordability. Luxury fashion often comes with a hefty price tag that most consumers simply cannot justify or afford. A genuine Louis Vuitton handbag can cost upwards of $2,000, while a high-quality dupe may retail for under $100. For many fashion enthusiasts, designer dupes offer a way to enjoy the aesthetics of luxury without the financial burden. Social media influencers and fashion bloggers have played a major role in normalizing and even glamorizing designer dupes. Platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube are filled with content showcasing affordable alternatives to luxury goods. ""Dupe hauls"" and ""Look for Less"" videos have amassed millions of views, making designer dupes a mainstream trend. Ethical Considerations While designer dupes may seem like a harmless way to enjoy fashion, they do raise important ethical questions. Many argue that they undermine the originality and creative effort of designers. Luxury brands invest heavily in research, craftsmanship, and design innovation. When those ideas are replicated and sold cheaply, it can feel like a theft of intellectual property. Moreover, the production of designer dupes often lacks the transparency and ethical standards upheld by many luxury brands. Questions about fair labor practices, environmental impact, and product safety become harder to answer when dealing with fast fashion manufacturers. On the other hand, supporters of designer dupes argue that fashion should be inclusive and accessible. They believe that style should not be limited to those who can afford designer price tags. For many consumers, dupes are not about fooling others—they're about self-expression and participating in trends without breaking the bank. The Role of Fast Fashion Fast fashion brands have been instrumental in the rise of designer dupes. Companies like Zara, H&M, Shein, and Forever 21 have mastered the art of quickly turning runway styles into mass-produced garments. These brands often draw inspiration from luxury collections and deliver similar looks within weeks. While these versions are not exact replicas, they bear striking resemblances to the originals. For example, a coat that closely resembles one seen on a Balenciaga runway may find its way into a fast fashion store for a fraction of the cost. Such practices have blurred the lines between inspiration and imitation, further fueling the designer dupes culture. Quality vs. Price One of the major debates surrounding designer dupes is the trade-off between quality and price. Luxury brands are known for their craftsmanship, attention to detail, and use of premium materials. Dupes, on the other hand, often cut corners in terms of construction and materials to keep costs low. While some designer dupes are surprisingly well-made, others may fall apart after a few uses. Consumers need to manage their expectations. You're unlikely to get the same longevity or finish in a dupe that you would from an original. However, for trend-driven items that may only be worn a few times, many shoppers find the lower cost worth it. Shopping for Designer Dupes Responsibly If you choose to shop for designer dupes, there are responsible ways to do so. First, avoid counterfeit products that illegally use logos or names of designer brands. Stick to items that are inspired by the look but are sold under different branding. Second, research the brands and sellers you buy from. While dupes are not luxury items, you can still seek out those made under ethical working conditions and from sustainable materials....","In the ever-evolving world of fashion, where trends come and go with the seasons, one phenomenon has managed to remain at the center of attention—designer dupes. These are products that mimic high-end designer items but come at a fraction of the cost. From handbags and shoes to sunglasses and belts, designer dupes are everywhere, especially in the age of social media and online shopping. But what exactly makes them so popular, and why are they both loved and criticized? What Are Designer Dupes? Designer dupes refer to items that closely resemble designer products but are not direct counterfeits. They do not carry the original brand's logo or trademarks but imitate the style, design, and overall appearance. For example, a bag that looks like a Chanel flap bag but is branded under a different name with a similar structure would be considered a dupe rather than a fake. It's important to differentiate designer dupes from counterfeit goods. While counterfeit items are illegal and violate trademark laws by directly copying logos and names, dupes typically operate in a legal gray area. They offer the look for less without falsely claiming to be the real thing. The Demand for Luxury on a Budget One of the biggest reasons behind the surge in popularity of designer dupes is affordability. Luxury fashion often comes with a hefty price tag that most consumers simply cannot justify or afford. A genuine Louis Vuitton handbag can cost upwards of $2,000, while a high-quality dupe may retail for under $100.

mov_0DC9180D7E82AE1B32FD683CB6461B73,"  We have all come to love Nan St George in The Buccaneers, but we are curious about the person who brings this role to life. Kristine Froseth, the ethereal, blue-eyed beauty, is making the world go round in Apple TV+'s period drama, and we are most interested in getting to know her better. This 29-year-old Norwegian-American model-turned-actor, who is currently seen juggling between duty and love on The Buccaneers, has built her impressive career with a lot of hard work and determination. Let's have a look at some fascinating facts about her professional and personal life. The Buccaneers' Nan St George AKA Kristine Froseth Is of Norwegian Descent She was born in New Jersey to Norwegian parents and split her childhood years between the US and Oslo, Norway. Due to her father's job, they had to travel back and forth quite a lot. Kristine Froseth in The Buccaneers (Credit: Apple TV+) This meant a rich travel history and exposure for little Kristine, familiarizing her with American as well as European culture, cuisine, etiquette, and much more, shaping her into the confident woman she is today. She Was Discovered in a Norwegian Mall Art Age 16 Kristine Froseth was merely 16 when she was spotted in a mall in Norway, in a catwalk audition, and that's how she began her modelling career. She was also scouted by the IMG Models agency back in Jersey. Imagine being so young and your life changes completely! Kristine Froseth with Leighton Meester in The Buccaneers (Credit: Apple TV+) She went on to model for high-fashion brands like Miu Miu, Prada, Armani, Chloe, and Chanel. This marked the beginning of her glorious career at a very tender age. She grew from strength to strength and became a coveted name on the ramp, representing international brands with style. She Is An Ambassador For Chanel, Representing The Brand Globally Another feather in Kristine's cap is that she is an ambassador for Chanel and doesn't take the responsibility lightly. She is seen representing the brand on events and runway shows, dressed in pristine Chanel fits and accessories, creating jaw-dropping looks. Lizzy and Nan in The Buccaneers (Credit: Apple TV+) Speaking about her association with Chanel to Elle, she said: I always admired what the brand represented—what [Coco Chanel] did for females at the time, giving them freedom and more opportunity. Her life feels nothing short of a fairytale, from representing this prestigious brand globally, attending the MET Gala twice, to rubbing shoulders with some of the top names in the fashion and film industry. She Began Her Acting Career by Chance, on A Casting Director's Suggestion Froseth's acting career began when a casting director urged her to send her portfolio for the movie adaptation of John Green's famous novel Looking for Alaska. While the film was never made, she was cast in the pilot for a series called Let The Right One In. It was in the year 2017 that her first film, Rebel in the Rye released. Nan and Theo in The Buccaneers (Credit: Apple TV+) In 2018, she starred in Apostle and Sierra Burgess Is A Loser, besides a mini-series called The Truth About The Harry Quebert Affair. When the John Green novel was finally announced for a mini-series on Hulu, Froseth played the role of Alaska Young in it. She also starred in Birds of Paradise on Amazon Prime Video before landing her lead role as Nan St George in The Buccaneers on Apple TV+. She is An Advocate of Mental Health, Sharing Her Experiences to Help Others Having suffered through anxiety herself, Kristine shares her experiences, openly talking about therapy and inspiring people about getting help from professionals when required. Still from The Buccaneers (Credit: Apple TV+) Speaking to Frenshe about it, she said: Before therapy, I definitely struggled with not letting my anxiety run my life. I'm really glad I started getting help with my anxious thoughts. Once I stopped attaching myself to the emotion and thought, I was able to breathe through it and see anxiety as a physical state instead of letting it take me on a ride all of sorts of worst case scenarios or thoughts. She further urged anyone struggling with mental health issues to reach out and seek help and not give up on themselves. She is Drawn To Strong Female Roles that Display Strength This adds up with her portrayal of Nan St George, too. Kristine chooses roles where she has a strong voice and a purpose, and is not simply an arm candy. This can be seen in her career choices, right from playing the misled cult member in Apostle or Veronica in Sierra Burgess Is A Loser. Still from The Buccaneers (Credit: Apple TV+) As Nan in The Buccaneers, too, she is the voice of reason and is ready to go to any extent to protect the people she loves, even if that means sacrificing her happiness. Kristine Froseth, much like Nan St George, makes her own rules and lives her life on her terms. As the character draws strength from the actor, and vice versa, we are intrigued to see what new chapters of acting finesse this marvelous actor will bestow on us in the upcoming episodes of The Buccaneers! Are you looking forward to watching Nan's journey? Let us know in the comments....","We have all come to love Nan St George in The Buccaneers, but we are curious about the person who brings this role to life.

C7EA7B98D1CD31E208760ABEC8A3C0B1,"  They included glittery blood, metallic masks and a beating heart. This week, the world's richest and most devoted fashion hounds made their twice-annual trek to Paris to shop for custom clothes at the latest couture shows. On the scene were celebrities like Kim Kardashian, newlyweds like Lauren Sánchez Bezos and fashion superstars like the mononymic designer Demna, who presented his final collection for Balenciaga. Even as couture weeks have become circuslike spectacles involving tabloid and social media stars, their main draw is the imagination and artistry that designers showcase on runways. The collections contain the most expensive and exquisite clothes money can buy. Of all the over-the-top, opulent and otherworldly looks at the shows, those on this list were some of the most exciting to look at -- and hardest to forget. -- Anthony Rotunno Schiaparelli: Most Body Oddity! Schiaparelli's latest experimentations with the human form included a pale caped dress with beaded eyeballs, a silky red gown with a back resembling a female torso and a jeweled necklace that looked -- and beat -- like a heart. Robert Wun: Most in Bold Blood! Fashion drama would be one way to describe Robert Wun's white comforter-like gown splattered with bedazzled blood stains, which brought to mind works of Truman Capote and Alfred Hitchcock. Iris Van Herpen: Most Gaseous! The wispy translucent fabrics of three ethereal Iris van Herpen looks made each appear to waft through the room like a cloud of (odorless) gas. Viktor & Rolf: Most Mother Goose! A bonnet and prominent feathers were elements suggesting that the matriarch of children's literature was a muse for Viktor & Rolf's tiered confection. Balenciaga: Most Tablecloth! Lace fabric smoothed to perfection wasn't the only thing Balenciaga's ball gown had in common with grandma's favorite table dressing. The gown, like a proper tablecloth, also provided ample coverage. Maison Margiela: Most Bride of C-3PO! Shiny, shimmery, splendid: Maison Margiela's collection featured three lustrous looks complete with matching face coverings, all of which conjured the image of a glamorous robot at a wedding (and a rehearsal dinner and a farewell brunch). Chanel: Most Flight Suit! It will cost a lot more than a can of Red Bull, but Chanel's creamy suit with a feathered jacket does what the energy drink promises to: Give you wings. Rahul Mishra: Most Golden Snitch! Even when stationary, Rahul Mishra's curvy gold frock had the movement of the frenetic magical ball from the Harry Potter franchise. Viktor & Rolf: Most Oil Slick! Not only did Viktor & Rolf's pair of iridescent and jet black dresses have an oily palette, but the way that they appeared to float down the runway also recalled the way spilled oil moves across water. Balenciaga: Most Generational Wealth! Expensive clothes, as this list shows, do not have a uniform appearance. But the look of wealth -- particularly old money -- for the most part still does, and it was exemplified by Balenciaga's faux mink coat and sheer tie-neck dress. Rahul Mishra: Most Human Trellis! With sequined blooms orbiting the face, Rahul Mishra's rosy mini dress evoked nothing so much as a wearable Instagram or Snapchat filter. Robert Wun: Most Arms! A couple of Robert Wun looks offered a solution to a common scenario -- a situation when one could use an extra hand -- by incorporating prosthetic limbs into their bodice and veil. Viktor & Rolf: Most Bunker Buster! Heavy and dangerous are words to describe Viktor & Rolf's ensemble of sagging dark gown and spiky headpiece. They are also words to describe a bomb that has lately been on a lot of lips.

The Literary Rendezvous at Rue Cambon In tribute to Gabrielle Chanel, who throughout her life surrounded herself with writers, poets, and women of letters, the House of Chanel launched the Rendez-vous littéraires rue Cambon in 2021. These literary gatherings, initiated and hosted by Charlotte Casiraghi, aim to foster and deepen dialogue with contemporary authors. Celebrating literature in all its forms, the events bring together timeless classics and modern voices through thoughtfully curated reading recommendations designed to transport and enrich the reader.

All rights reserved Edith Wharton, Chez les heureux du monde © Le Livre de Poche, 2010 A brilliant portrayal of New York high society at the turn of the 20th century, The House of Mirth is now considered a cornerstone of early American literature. Centered on themes of marriage and social mobility, the novel follows the tragic path of Lily Bart, a beautiful but penniless orphan who struggles to maintain her place in a world governed by rigid codes and appearances. With elegance and acuity, Edith Wharton exposes the constraints imposed on women in a society where decorum is a cage and the slightest transgression can have lasting consequences.

This memory serves as the starting point for a deeper meditation on marginality, the gaze of others, and the transformative power of reading in shaping identity.

Through their turbulent coming-of-age, Marion Brunet delves into themes of familial tension, social determinism, latent violence, and the yearning for freedom.

mov_1C4871C519B5DB2E8D81B8C63573CEE0,"  Olivia Jade Giannulli has begun a new chapter of her life in a brand-new city. The 25-year-old influencer and daughter of actor Lori Loughlin and fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, posted a YouTube vlog Wednesday, where she started off by wishing her followers a “Good morning from Paris.” “This is going to be such a fun adventure to film and I'm here for a little while living,” she said. “So, I'm really excited to get some videos out for you guys. It's just going to be such an exciting, formative time.” Giannulli did not explain to her 1.8 million YouTube subscribers why she decided to move to an entirely new country, but did let them know what she's been up to as she walked to go grab coffee. She also talked about her experience in Paris thus far and the Paris Fashion Week events she attended. 'I'm living in Paris for a little while. That's the update,' the influencer said () 'I'm living in Paris for a little while. That's the update,' the influencer said () “I've just had a really crazy busy week since being in Paris,” she said. “I did the Patou show, the Chanel show, which was amazing. Then we took the train to London.” “Now I'm back home in Paris. I'm living in Paris for a little while. That's the update,” she added. Giannulli continued the vlog by teasing the rest of her Parisian adventures as she said, “A lot more fun, exciting change is also coming in the future, which I'm so excited to share with you guys. I'm hopefully launching my business at the end of this year. There's just a lot going on, and it's all really good and really exciting.” The move comes six years after her mother and father were among 33 wealthy parents who were charged with trying to rig the American college admissions system. They admitted to paying half a million dollars to guarantee their daughters – Olivia Jade and Isabella Rose Giannulli – admission to the University of Southern California (USC) under false pretenses. More in Celebrity In October 2020, Loughlin was sentenced to two months in prison, while the designer was sentenced to five months. In addition to the prison sentence, Loughlin was ordered to pay a $150,000 fine and perform 100 hours of community service. Under his own plea deal, Loughlin's husband was ordered to pay a $250,000 fine and perform 250 hours of community service. Months later, Giannulli broke her silence about the college admissions scandal during an appearance on Red Table Talk. “I think that what hasn't been super public is that there is no justifying or excusing what happened,” she said during the episode, which aired in December 2020. “Because what happened was wrong.” Since then, Giannulli has joked about the scandal on her YouTube channel, telling her followers last year that she was looking forward to her kitchen “not feeling like a prison.” Giannulli went on to acknowledge how viewers would mock her for the prison reference, with jokes about her parents' college admission scandal. “Save the jokes,” she said. “Don't want to hear it.

While we can't justify her exact pick (a mere $10,800), we can totally score this  that channels luxury for less. Clearly a friend of the brand, Cruz at the Chanel Haute Couture FW 25/26 show in Paris on July 8. Looking like the definition of luxury, the movie star wore a head-to-toe Chanel look that consisted of a tweed suit from the 2026 resort collection, cat-eye sunglasses and a gold bracelet. She finished off the ensemble with red nails and a voluminous blow-out. The look's crème de la crème was her classic quilted Chanel bag, and it's everything we want to carry on our shoulder this season. Thankfully, Amazon came through with — and its thousands less. Get the for just at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate at the date of publication, July 17, 2025, but are subject to change. The is proof you don't have to take out a loan to get a designer-looking bag — you simply have to know where to shop. Like Cruz's style, it features that classic Chanel flap-over design, quilted exterior, chain strap and shiny gold hardware. It's made entirely of PU leather, so it can stand up to years of wear and tear. Plus, it can transition into a crossbody as well. At just the perfect size, the purse can fit almost everything you'd need for a day out on the town, including a wallet, sunglasses, phone and makeup for touchups. In addition to the black option, you can shop the bag in several stunning colors from classic camel to pretty mint green. We bet they'll have you running back for more. Shoppers are starting to catch on to the sparkle of this bag, with over 200 people buying it in the last month. Reviewers rave that it “looks just like” the more expensive version “that is way more money.” They also love the functionality of it since the bag has “enough room to fit essentials in and [is] not heavy to carry,” per the shopper. Whether you're heading to the office or the airport for a getaway, you'll want to have in tow. It's the pick that dresses up any look, but still can mix and match with several vibes.

Another massive fail for Lauryn as she's ended up *even more* blacklisted than she already was. Of course none of us printed her story. What a girl's girl. |Lauryn Goodman was all smiles as she stepped out in the sunshine for a wholesome family day at London Zoo celebrating Kinara's 2^(nd) birthday, proving once again that love and laughter with her children are the perfect antidote to online negativity. The proud mum-of-two was spotted enjoying the popular attraction with son Kairo and daughter Kiki, soaking up the summer sun and focusing on what matters most — family. The outing comes after ongoing pressure from online trolls, including cruel commentary from gossip forums like Tattle Life. But Lauryn is choosing to stay positive and focus on her children, continuing to rise above the noise with strength. Looking effortlessly stylish, Lauryn wore a white and blue ensemble inspired by trending TikTok Shop finds, paired with classic Zara sandals and a timeless Chanel boy bag — the perfect blend of affordable chic and designer flair. Kairo looked cool and confident in Dolce & Gabbana shorts teamed with a simple white Zara tee and comfy Crocs, while little Kinara melted hearts in a sweet pink mini skirt and a delicate Ted Baker top, matching her mum's sense of summery style. Lauryn, who has spoken openly about the challenges of being in the public eye, is keen to show a more grounded and authentic side of her life — one where normality, and motherhood take centre stage. “Nothing matters more to me than my kids,” Lauryn says. “Spending time with them, just doing everyday things, keeps me grounded and reminds me what's real.” The family were seen laughing, pointing at animals, and enjoying ice cream under the sun — a true reminder that happiness can still thrive even in the face of public scrutiny.

She finds it deeply disturbing and invasive that anyone would attempt to access or share their confidential NHS records."" * **• Abuse by PR Professional** *""It is deeply disappointing that someone in a professional position — particularly within the PR industry — would engage in targeted and harmful behaviour. Lauryn has been subjected to unacceptable abuse by Rachel Monk, which is now being addressed through the appropriate legal channels. What makes this even more troubling is the irony: Rachel appears to be defending the online trolling of her own clients' children, while simultaneously contributing to the harassment of another mother. No one should have to tolerate this kind of behaviour, especially from someone who claims to uphold ethical standards in communications."" * **This can all be verified via Lauryn's recent Instagram Stories and a post she commented on that can be found Lorraine's official Instagram page**. |","Seems Lauryn was really, really put out by the comment RM left on the Lorraine post. Received this last week. And yes, I can share as it was meant for publication! Another massive fail for Lauryn as she's ended up *even more* blacklisted than she already was. Of course none of us printed her story. What a girl's girl. |Lauryn Goodman was all smiles as she stepped out in the sunshine for a wholesome family day at London Zoo celebrating Kinara's 2^(nd) birthday, proving once again that love and laughter with her children are the perfect antidote to online negativity. The proud mum-of-two was spotted enjoying the popular attraction with son Kairo and daughter Kiki, soaking up the summer sun and focusing on what matters most — family. The outing comes after ongoing pressure from online trolls, including cruel commentary from gossip forums like Tattle Life. But Lauryn is choosing to stay positive and focus on her children, continuing to rise above the noise with strength. Looking effortlessly stylish, Lauryn wore a white and blue ensemble inspired by trending TikTok Shop finds, paired with classic Zara sandals and a timeless Chanel boy bag — the perfect blend of affordable chic and designer flair. Kairo looked cool and confident in Dolce & Gabbana shorts teamed with a simple white Zara tee and comfy Crocs, while little Kinara melted hearts in a sweet pink mini skirt and a delicate Ted Baker top, matching her mum's sense of summery style. Lauryn, who has spoken openly about the challenges of being in the public eye, is keen to show a more grounded and authentic side of her life — one where normality, and motherhood take centre stage. “Nothing matters more to me than my kids,” Lauryn says. “Spending time with them, just doing everyday things, keeps me grounded and reminds me what's real.” The family were seen laughing, pointing at animals, and enjoying ice cream under the sun — a true reminder that happiness can still thrive even in the face of public scrutiny. [Lauryn 1]( 2]( 3]( Please see the source quotes below: **• Legal Representation** *""Lauryn has appointed Rory Lynch of Gately Legal to represent her — the same legal team who successfully acted for Neil and Donna Sands in their £300,000 harassment and defamation case against Sebastian Bond."" * **• Online Safety Advocacy** *""Lauryn has launched a parliamentary petition calling for the strengthening of the Online Safety Act 2023, aiming to better protect individuals and families from online harassment and breaches of privacy."" * **• Police Investigation** *""The Metropolitan Police are currently reviewing Lauryn's case. Her legal team have advised her that the publication of certain private material — including illegal online threads — may constitute a criminal offence. It is also understood that Sebastian Bond is already in breach of reporting restrictions outlined in a High Court order."" * **• Potential Legal Consequences** *""Breaching a court order can carry serious legal consequences, including imprisonment, financial penalties, or the seizure of assets. Despite receiving formal warnings, the individual concerned has continued to disregard legal boundaries."" * **• Children's Privacy Violation** *""Lauryn is committed to protecting her children above all else. She finds it deeply disturbing and invasive that anyone would attempt to access or share their confidential NHS records."" * **• Abuse by PR Professional** *""It is deeply disappointing that someone in a professional position — particularly within the PR industry — would engage in targeted and harmful behaviour.

就像巴黎街頭的女人，Hermès Nantucket 腕錶的魅力，有種不言自明的氣質。 方中帶長的矩形錶殼靈感源自品牌標誌性的「Chaine d'ancre」船錨鍊，29毫米的精鋼設計，以186顆鑽石環繞，彷彿為時間點上了光暈。 錶盤上兩顆小巧鑽石靜靜閃爍在珍珠母貝的柔光之上，搭配標誌性的大象灰 Swift 小牛皮錶帶，一切都恰到好處，精緻得毫不費力。 （價格 NTD 320,500）
精品方形錶推薦 2：Chanel｜Boy·Friend
香奈兒 Boy·Friend 腕錶是經典與當代的交會點。 錶殼線條向香奈兒 No.5 香水瓶蓋與芳登廣場（Place Vendôme）致敬，以近乎建築的方式勾勒女性手腕的俐落風骨。 這只小型精鋼款鑲有62顆明亮式切割鑽石，蛋白石色雕紋錶盤內斂卻不乏層次，搭配可替換的菱格紋小牛皮錶帶，在陽剛與柔美之間流轉。 她是那種穿著寬肩西裝、踩著細跟鞋走進高級會所的女子，冷靜、洗鍊、不需證明什麼，就讓人難以忽視。 （價格 NTD 283,000）
精品方形錶推薦 3：Harry Winston｜Avenue C Mini

精品方形錶推薦 4：Cartier｜Tank Américaine
在方形錶的歷史裡，Cartier Tank 可謂是開山之作。 而這枚 Tank Américaine 迷你款，則是在經典的基礎上注入更細緻的現代語彙。 18K玫瑰金錶殼細長優雅，鍍銀陽光射線紋飾錶盤與藍鋼劍形指針交織出都會女性的從容節奏。 深棕鱷魚皮錶帶低調中見品味，一如深夜裡回家的她，即使卸下高跟鞋，也依然保持從容的優雅。 （價格 NTD 285,000）
精品方形錶推薦 5：Jaeger-LeCoultre｜Reverso Classic
若說錶界有一場屬於優雅的魔術，那一定是積家的 Reverso。 這只 Reverso Classic 小型款，以翻轉錶殼設計，賦予佩戴者一份私密的自由。 一面是銀灰緞面與扭索飾紋的經典錶盤，一面可鐫刻英文姓名、日期等情感記憶。 藍鋼劍型指針與立體阿拉伯數字呼應1930年代的優雅，五節式不銹鋼錶鍊輕巧貼腕。 她是時間的寫詩者，不急不徐地記錄人生每一次翻轉，像是在鬧鐘聲裡刻下一場夢境的餘韻。 （價格 NTD 281,000）
精品方形錶推薦 6：Longines｜DolceVita
如果方形錶是一幅畫，Longines DolceVita 就是那種充滿義大利陽光的構圖。 這款以1920年代為靈感的多情系列腕錶，擁有 20.5 x 32mm 的修長比例，搭配18K黃金錶殼與46顆頂級鑽石，閃耀中不失古典氣息。 銀色 Flinqué 飾紋錶盤、藍鋼指針與漆繪羅馬數字交織出復古風情，黑色鱷魚皮錶帶則為整體注入一絲都會感。 它不只是一只錶，更像是一場漫步羅馬黃昏的夢，甜美、慵懶、值得反覆回味。 （價格 NTD 240,100）

In addition to her modeling success — including being a Guess? spokesmodel and walking the runway for high-fashion labels like Chanel, Giorgio Armani and Valentino — Silvstedt also dabbled into music. Her debut album Girl on the Run featured the lead single “Hello Hey,” which peaked at No. 7 on the Swedish Singles Chart.

n3uyueo,"  1.) I'd bet a good chunk of money that compliments about fragrance are pretty closely tied to how conventionally attractive you are. 2.) Most mainstream colognes/perfumes are boring to own for yourself but are interesting on others. I find Bleu de Chanel to be too ""boring"" for myself to ever own but when it is applied with some grace it is a really attractive sillage to smell out in public. It's like I'd rather smell this on my Uber driver than live with it myself. 3.) Wearing really niche perfumes that smell like dank shit to most people defeats one big aspect of wearing fragrance. Yes you should buy fragrance that makes you happy first and foremost but I really do think some people should consider how it completes their presentation to the world. Doing twenty sprays of something that smells like festering dog semen & patchouli because it's niche and YOU like it doesn't mean people are going to like it too. But that's such a small percentage of people it doesn't even matter. 4.) Old is just perception of what our parents and elders used to wear. For example Floris no.89 or Special no. 127 smells more modern to my nose than Coty Stetson which my grandfather used to wear. Floris 89 is thirty years older than stetson & 127 is over 80 years older. But because I grew up around people who never wore Floris I don't associate it with old people.","1.)

The cardigan, which was layered over a plain white tank top, was worn off the shoulder and sat slouchy on her shoulders.

She recently released a new version of her viral Peptide Lip Tint in Lemontini ($16). Since then, people have been opting for this brighter, more saturated shade of yellow and incorporating it into their beauty routines in myriad ways. It's officially a limoncello summer. One of the best ways to incorporate the limoncello trend into your beauty routine is via a clean, crisp manicure. At least that's what celebs seem to think. Bieber recently showed off a lemon-yellow manicure on Instagram while promoting her new lip product. Meanwhile, Kourtney Kardashian posted an Instagram story showing off her sunny French manicure. Even Charlize Theron is sporting yellow nails, having recently made an appearance in NYC wearing a cool, crescent-shaped design.

n42rrkz,"  My mom bought me a Chanel bag for my 40th birthday. The hardest thing I had to do was tell her I didn't like it and needed to exchange it.

urn:li:share:7352684138874728448,"  How are your customers' trust patterns dependent on your brand color choices? Why is tech always blue, finance obsessed with green, and food/retail addicted to red, orange, and yellow? This isn't just design. It's color psychology meeting consumer trust patterns. And every industry leans into it, intentionally. Let's break it down: → Tech = Blue Blue signals intelligence, trust, and calm. It creates a sense of security, perfect for companies managing your data, identity, or future. Brands like IBM, Intel Corporation, Meta, and LinkedIn all use it to say: “We're stable. You're safe.” → Finance = Green Green connects to money, growth, and reassurance. It's both literal and emotional, invoking prosperity, steadiness, and renewal. Used by companies like Fidelity Investments, TD, and Mint to subtly reinforce financial well-being. → Retail & Food = Red Red drives action. It increases appetite, creates urgency, and attracts immediate attention. Fast food, retail sales, and entertainment brands? Red is everywhere. Think The Coca-Cola Company, Netflix, Target, McDonald's. → Luxury = Black Black is power. Sophistication. Timeless elegance. It doesn't beg for attention, it commands it. Luxury brands like CHANEL, Prada Group, and Rolls-Royce use it to say: “This isn't for everyone.” → Wellness & Beauty = Soft pinks, beige, and muted tones These colors evoke a sense of calm, warmth, and subtlety. They encourage trust and emotional ease, key for skincare, wellness, and beauty brands. Glossier, Inc., Savage X Fenty, and Aesop are all built on these soft signals. → Sustainability & Ethical Brands = Earthy greens and browns These hues reflect nature, purity, and authenticity. They communicate grounded values and ethical responsibility. Think Patagonia, The Honest Company, Whole Foods Market. → Crypto, Web3, AI = Purple, gradients, futuristic tones Purple signals imagination, innovation, and depth. Often mixed with neon gradients, it positions brands as next-gen, visionary, and untethered from tradition. Brands like OpenAI, Discord, and Avalanche heavily lean in this direction. Color isn't decoration. It's a strategy. It's psychology. It's positioning. It's the first thing your audience feels, before they read a single word. If your brand's colors are chosen by “what looks cool,” instead of “what builds belief,” You may already be misunderstood. Color isn't just about standing out, it's about fitting in, where it matters most.

mov_2B9B7A85FC20F32BFF32228A2AB64ED3,"  Zepto co-founder Aadit Palicha last week announced the 10-minute delivery for luxury cosmetic brands-- Estée Lauder's M.A.C., The Ordinary and Clinique--on the platform. From discounted offerings to previously elusive luxury and global brands, e-commerce and quick commerce platforms are witnessing a multifold surge in beauty and skincare product sales amid soaring demand. In fact, capitalizing on this trend, Zepto co-founder Aadit Palicha last week announced the 10-minute delivery for luxury cosmetic brands-- Estée Lauder's M.A.C., The Ordinary and Clinique--on the platform. After observing a surge in demand for existing beauty brands like Maybelline, Lakmé, and Faces Canada, Mamaearth, Renee, Swiss Beauty, and SUGAR Cosmetics, Zepto decided to expand its portfolio by including luxury brands as well, to offer users a wider range of options, said Devendra Meel, Chief Business Officer at Zepto. According to a report by Bengaluru-based consultancy firm Redseer, India's beauty industry is expected to reach $34 billion by 2028, driven by rising disposable incomes, increased consumer aspirations, and the influence of social media and e-commerce. Highlighting changing consumer behaviour, Amazon Beauty, Director Siddharth Bhagat told Storyboard18 about a strong shift towards tech-enabled, trend-led and personalised experiences for the cosmetics and skincare products. He said that faster deliveries, influencer-driven discovery, and the rise of D2C and international brands are further fueling the momentum. ""Amazon has witnessed a 12x growth in cosmetics due to the recent success of newly launched brands in 2025,"" Bhagat added. Nykaa, the pioneer in building a beauty-centric digital commerce platform, said its beauty business has grown 25 percent on a year-on-year basis, recording a revenue of Rs 7,251 crore for fiscal year 2025. Nykaa's beauty vertical includes e-commerce, physical retail, its house of brands, as well as an eB2B business. Nykaa's closest competitor, Myntra, has also ramped up its beauty segment on the platform to capitalise on the demand. Deepak Joshi, Senior Director - Category Management, Beauty and Personal Care, Myntra said the platform's dedicated 'Beauty' segment has outpaced the online beauty market by two-fold, registering more than 50 percent consistent year-on-year increase in monthly active users. ""Currently, Myntra Beauty boasts more than 2,900 brands,"" Joshi added. 'Tier-2 demand surge' Industry experts have acknowledged that tier-2 cities have emerged as a crucial market for platforms, driving demand for both affordable and premium cosmetics and skincare products. Meel from Zepto said that while quick commerce has largely remained metro-centric, traction for beauty products has notably increased in Tier-2 cities as well. Myntra's Joshi also noted that nearly half of the beauty buyers on the platform come from tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Besides, He also mentioned that Myntra's quick commerce service, M-Now, witnessed a 1.4x spike in demand for beauty products on Mother's Day in 2025. Notably, Vishal Chaturvedi, Vice President, The Body Shop, Asia South, said that quick commerce has delivered exceptional results for the company, almost doubling its growth compared to last year. ""Our specially curated selection of packed gift boxes and mini packs has seen strong sales on the quick commerce platform,"" Chaturvedi said. 'Rise of K-Beauty' In the competitive beauty market, digital commerce platforms have expanded their portfolio by adding luxury and premium beauty offerings, particularly Korean beauty (K-beauty) brands. According to the Amazon spokesperson, the K-Beauty category on the platform has witnessed a 75 percent year-on-year growth. According to Bhagat, K-beauty products primarily resonates with urban and digital-savvy women, aged between 20 and 35 years. ""The urban women have embraced K-beauty products to a larger extent, especially from cities like Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Pune"". Moreover, women from tier-2 cities are also exploring the K-beauty products through trial SKUs like sheet masks and minis, he added. Bucking the trend, Bhagat said Amazon has observed that a rising cohort of male consumers are also experimenting with Korean skincare, particularly around functional solutions like cleansers, serums, and sunscreens. A range of K-beauty brands have entered into Indian market via digital commerce platforms, such as COSRX, Laneige, and Beauty of Joseon, TIRTIR, Medicube, and Skin1004. Meanwhile, Myntra said that they have witnessed a 150 percent YoY growth in K-beauty category. Beyond K-beauty, several international luxury beauty brands are also capturing Indian consumers' attention through digital channels. Nykaa has a dedicated segment, called Nykaa Luxe, which offers a wide range of cosmetics and skincare products from luxury brands such as Armani beauty, Chanel, L'Oréal Luxe, Eucerin, Dior, Tom Ford, sol de janerio, among others. The company noted that the average annual spend by its top 10% customers is $395 on premium beauty products. Following suit, other platforms like Tira and Tata CliQ have also expanded their beauty portfolios. Myntra's quick commerce venture also offers a selection of international and premium beauty brands, including YSL and Estee Lauder.
