n3fkjjx,"  So I ended up emailing Testerz last night asking if they could re-enable my account. And they did! Still a crap ton of vitamin supplements and creatine powder with some ball clamps and penis pumps/stretchers sprinkled over top, slathered in hemp based personal lubricant. BUT! There's some hidden gems. I'm always looking for skincare products, and I found some anti-aging cream that looks to be a Loreal Regenerist dupe along with under-eye serum. There's at least 3-4 pretty cool looking coloring books geared towards teens and adults. This is just one example. Do you do any homebrewing? They have a few different packs of glass bottles for home brewing and food grade fermentation jugs (not pictured). Feel like garbage? Throw one of these shower steamer pods in a hot shower for a mood boost. My bf bought me the same scent profile shower steamers from Bath&Body Works a while back and they smell great. Phlebotomy practice kits for any nursing students in your life. A single waiting room chair for reasons unbeknownst to me lol. A sweet looking travel pillow for flights. There's several family games, but I thought this pickle game looked the most fun. There's things for your lawn and garden like grass seed, ant insecticide that's allegedly for organic gardening, and there's these bug traps I hope to never have to attempt to use. Would probably just baptize the house in gas and cleanse the whole thing with fire, but that's just me. I for one like Testerz because you can give honest reviews and not have to worry about retaliation. For just one example, I tried a melatonin alternative sleepaid and gave it 2 stars. Their product list changes periodically. I hope this was a little bit more helpful. Since I'm only allowed 1 photo per post I just took a screenshot of everything grouped together. I hope this was a little bit more helpful ! [img](8490ugg688df1)","So I ended up emailing Testerz last night asking if they could re-enable my account. And they did!
