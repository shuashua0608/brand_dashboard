17868406239331253,"  #sheglam #sheglamglacierglosmoothingprimer #faceprimer #sheglamfam I bought the sheglam ""glacier glo"" smoothing primer off Amazon. It is $8.99. The primer comes with a little spatula. It claims to hydrate & smooth pores & control oil. The texture of this primer reminds me of the huda beauty ""blur jam"" & the touchinsol ""icy sherbet"" primers. I have both. Both of those are silicone primers & are thick to apply. I assumed this one would be the same,  but surprisingly it melted right into my skin & is lightweight. I was honestly shocked by this primer. It was not what I expected when I applied it. It did give me some hydration. It's not a crazy amount of hydration,  but definitely some. It does give you a smooth base. I can't speak to the oil control bc I am not oily. I lean more dry. I honestly think this is a great affordable primer. It's fun to play with too. If you're in the market for a new primer, I'd give this one a try #makeup #makeupjunkie #makeuplover #makeupaddict #makeupartist #mua #selftaughtmua #undiscoveredmuas #bblogger #beautyblogger #makeupblogger #beauty #cosmetics #microinfluencer #makeupinfluencer #newmakeup #makeupnews ##review #reviewer #makeupreview #makeupreviewer #beautyreview","I bought the sheglam ""glacier glo"" smoothing primer off Amazon.
