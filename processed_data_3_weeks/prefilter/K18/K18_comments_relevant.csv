n0t29qm,"  lots of other folks have mentioned that the example picture is dimensional vs all over color. like others have said, it would be better to use a 20 vol developer with the lightener powder for a longer period of time, instead of using 30 volume for a shorter period of time. if you got to the strand test color in 30 mins with 30 volume, you can definitely achieve it with a longer processing time using 20 volume and you'd be less likely to cause major damage. you can process for up to an hour, so just keep checking the color while the lightener processes. my recommendation would be to lighten your entire head in sections like you said you plan to, to get to a base color similar to what your strand test looks like. if you can wait a couple days and do some deep conditioning treatments after you have your base color, that would be best. i'd then go back in with a technique like this to achieve something similar to the highlights shown in your goal picture — she's obviously using a different tone of color here, but the takeaway of the video should be the lightener application techniques: https://youtu.be/gegncnXXxi0 pay attention to the volumes she is using — DO NOT go back in to highlight your base with 30 volume developer, your highlights will fry. you must use a 10 volume developer and give it time to process. she also has a lot of other great videos about doing highlights if you wanna browse her channel — again, don't focus on the color/toner shades she's using, just the bleach application techniques to help achieve the dimensional look in your example. imo, if you are okay with your base color matching your swatch, you'd be better off leaving it at that and then adding the highlights with a volume 10 developer, versus trying to lighten your whole head again. your hair would be much better off that way, versus trying to push it with another whole head application of lightener! you'd be very close to the example photo anyway after toning. sally's ion line has an olaplex dupe that you should definitely pick up. it's under $15 and one set would probably get you through 2-3 processes, so you might wanna pick up 2 boxes if your hair is thick, because it would be better to to have a little extra for next time vs. running out. here's the link, they have it in stores too: https://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-color/other-products-and-applications/fillers-and-additives/absolute-perfection-dual-kit/SBS-405019.html i'd also buy some k18 and apply it before/after processes: cheapest option here that i have been able to squeeze 2-3 applications out of in the past, but you'd be better off investing in the $30 pump bottle that's available on amazon: https://www.target.com/p/k18-leave-in-molecular-repair-hair-mask-0-17-oz/-/A-85972091 and then use a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner to help rebuild your hair integrity after all these processes. redken's bond repair line is pretty good and relatively affordable! pick up a nice serum too to keep the mids/ends healthy. if you can't invest in these products, i promise your hair would look better at whatever color it is now than lighter and unhealthy! but i think if you invest in the bond builder from sally's, k18, and a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner, your goal example is within reach. also not sure what your current base color is like or if you've done a whole head lightening process before, but make sure you understand how to apply the lightener for a whole head application so you don't end up with an uneven base color before you go back in to highlight. if you don't apply the lightener correctly you will end up with really uneven color — lighter roots from the heat of your head accelerating the bleach, etc. here is a good video that explains how to approach whole head lightening — as with the other example video, don't focus on the end result color, just pay attention to the techniques used to achieve an even color. adjust the processing times according to your goal base color: https://youtu.be/tYg3ZmbX5iw?si=mXSeHVLH6rBVWubP saw that you don't have sally's in your country. there are other products similar to olaplex; see if you can find ALL hd PLEX or LIW ph plex!

i think you'd need to order them online. they are both similar products you will mix into the bleach and color during the color/lightening processes. this step is definitely the most important",2025-07-01 18:46:14,en,REDDIT,,,,,1,False,True,"The comment directly mentions k18 multiple times as a recommended product for hair repair and bond rebuilding during hair coloring processes.

1lpdd6c,"  Does anyone actually feel like bond repair actually made a drastic difference ? I recently started using k18 leave in mask and it feels strange not using conditioner. I'm afraid of protein build up and I'm just wondering if this is going to backfire. I have fine hair that I recently dyed with a Demi to get to my natural brunette color. I have felt like my hair has felt pretty dry and brittle. I had mostly virgin hair before I dyed it with maybe 1/4 at the bottom being left over balayage. I got scared that I was just depriving my hair of the moisture process by skipping actual conditioner by using k18 leave in mask. I only spent $30 on the mini so I'm okay to give up on it if it's just not realistic or meant for me. I'm just curious what other people's experience have been with bond repair.

So I covered it with black box dye as a natural blonde… I have had it for about 2 years, only touching up the roots with black every month or so. It's definitely healthy in my opinion and I have used lots of k18 and redken acidic bonding etc. I decided I was done with black and got two color removers (color zap) and my hair lifted a lot actually! I would say it's more of an auburn color now, not super orange or red, kind of orangey brown 6/7 level. No black is left. I planned to do it all myself but got too scared and decided to book a consultation at a rlly good hair salon I like. However I am so nervous to go because my hair looks so fucking ridiculous.

n1872a7,"  Hi, pro here. The ingredients are not the same. If you put a bit of store bought shampoo in your palm can you turn it upside down? It boils down to the ph balance on what makes hair products professional or not truly. I am not personally a fan of sulfate free products. I like the active cleaning agents/bubbles. However; I will say Pantene is the worst for your hair. It has wax in it. You can literally wax your floors with it. Long term use causes a waxy build up that I've personally cut off of peoples hair shaft. It's awful and can cause much bigger issues. I can wash someone's hair and tell if they use it (often). K18 and Olaplex can be good. However, too much protein can cause breakage and frizz, you don't need it that often unless it's very damaged. Using professional products correctly is the key.

mov_81422227036D91C8FD46BBC7501B3D0B,"  The best shampoos for dry hair can be total game-changers in your styling routine. Whether your hair is naturally dry or parched from excessive color treatments and heat styling, brittle strands are a stubborn bummer. And as you know by now, dryness doesn't discriminate—even oily scalps can lead to straw-like strands. Cherin Choi, a bicoastal hairstylist, emphasizes the importance of selecting a formula with ingredients that cater to the specific needs of dry hair, setting you up for long-term success. “Opt for shampoos containing nourishing oils, aloe vera, or hyaluronic acid to hydrate without weighing hair down,” she advises. That's why we combed through the backs of beloved bottles, checked in with experts to learn why they work, and made sure our editors gave them a good suds to see what the hype is all about. Our top pick was the HairStory New Wash, a lather-less shampoo (yes, that's right) that offers a milky cleanse hydrating enough to skip the conditioner if you please. Other options on this list will work overtime to repair your split ends, fight dandruff, and more. Best shampoos for dry hair, at a glance How we tested shampoo for dry hair AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron We tested shampoo for dry hair based on ingredients, texture, how well they lathered (and washed out), and how our hair felt post-wash and beyond. The best shampoos had ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides to deeply nourish, hydrate and detangle strands, and all gave us a nice thick and creamy lather. Finally, the ones that made this list kept our hair velvety smooth, flyaway and static free. Post two to three washes, our strands were soft, smooth and moisturized for days. Best Overall: New Wash by HairStory Courtesy of brand HairStory New Wash $46 Amazon Ingredient highlights: aloe vera leaf juice, evening primrose oil, sunflower seed oil Smells like: lightly floral Safe for color-treated hair: yes Size: 8 oz Hair Type: all While the idea of a non-foaming shampoo might raise an eyebrow (who doesn't love a rich lather?) , Hairstory's New Wash makes a compelling case. Too much foam can actually dry out your hair, which is why this formula transforms into a milky wash instead—cleansing, conditioning, supporting scalp health, and enhancing texture, all without harsh detergents. It's a favorite of Choi for good reason: it works on all hair types, plays nice with color-treated strands, and can even replace your conditioner if you're a one-and-done kind of washer. You're welcome to follow up with a conditioner, but we love the built-in convenience.
