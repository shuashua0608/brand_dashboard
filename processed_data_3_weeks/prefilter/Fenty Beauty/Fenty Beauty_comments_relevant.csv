tw_sl_5da78be4f42c33a255d7d0bcf2f0f026,"  C elebrities ARE venturing beyond the billboard and the big screen—and into big business. Hailey Bieber, a model married to Justin, recently sold Rhode, her make-up brand, in a deal valued at as much as $1bn. Skims, a shapewear label founded by Kim Kardashian, a reality- TV star, makes $1bn in annual sales and is expected to list on the stockmarket soon. Rihanna is now a billionaire not directly because of her music, but thanks to Fenty Beauty, her make-up label. Ryan Reynolds, a Hollywood actor, is active in everything from telecoms to online privacy. Surprisingly, many of these superstar businesses have become a source of innovative new consumer products. Celebrities have long used their fame to peddle things. Michael Jordan, a basketball player, is thought to have made over $1.5bn from his partnership with Nike over the past 40 years. Nespresso has reportedly paid George Clooney more than $40m to have his mug selling its coffee. Two decades ago Hulk Hogan, a professional wrestler, helped market the “Hulkster” cheeseburger, pre-cooked and frozen for your convenience. The practice continues. This week President Donald Trump launched “Victory 45-47”, a line of fragrances for men and women priced at $249, having launched “Fight Fight Fight” ($199) last year. By contrast, the new superstar brands put the A -list into capitalist. Ms Bieber and co are involved in operations and hold equity stakes of varying sizes in the underlying businesses. Many celebs have begun to rethink the value of traditional endorsement and licensing deals. Social media now give them a line straight to their fans. Direct-to-consumer distribution, meanwhile, has made getting a product to market easier than ever. Given that the real money is in building and owning a brand , rather than advertising, why not launch one instead? This thinking in turn is altering the life-cycle of consumer goods. Just as pharmaceutical giants acquire biotech startups to refresh their drug pipelines, so consumer giants are buying up the most successful celebrity brands. The match makes sense. The hardest part of building a brand is the first 100,000 sales, but the A -list has a fan base that is well disposed towards them and their wares. Once a celebrity brand gets off the ground, a consumer giant has the production and distribution networks to help it grow. Hence the series of deals. Among the first was Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics, a headphones and streaming business co-founded by Dr Dre, a music producer. Many were shocked when the tech giant, which prides itself on in-house research and design, paid around $3bn for the brand in 2014. More recently Diageo, a drinksmaker, has bought a tequila firm co-owned by Mr Clooney, in a deal valued at around $1bn, and a gin distiller partly owned by Mr Reynolds, for up to $610m. Obviously, a famous name is not enough on its own to get a second-rate product flying off the shelves. You need only peer into the bargain bin in any cosmetics shop to spot the remainders of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's beauty products, or Sarah Jessica Parker's scents. Some of Mr Trump's newest offerings may soon join them. According to a perfume-review website, Victory 45-47 for men is “not particularly memorable”. Shoppers today are quick to review products on social media. Fans might try a new lipstick or t -shirt produced by a celebrity. But they will not buy it a second time if they are disappointed. At their best, celebrity brands are innovative, creative—and lucrative for their owners. Yet, just like show business, brutal flops are possible, too. ■ Subscribers to The Economist can sign up to our Opinion newsletter , which brings together the best of our leaders, columns, guest essays and reader correspondence.

tw_sl_b6e15685b8620f55b3ae75c177d49f6f,"  Remember when celebrity endorsements meant awkward TV ads with stars clutching products they'd probably never use? Those days are long gone. Today's star entrepreneurs aren't just lending their names to existing products; they're building real brands from scratch, and some are absolutely smashing it (in line with the best rebrands). Because while fame gets a brand noticed, what keeps people coming back is authentic storytelling, smart positioning, and understanding what your audience wants. And that's something we can all learn from. So let's dive into what's working and why. 01. Rihanna: Fenty Beauty Barbadian singer Rihanna (real name Robyn Rihanna Fenty) is one of the wealthiest and best-selling musicians of all time, with estimated sales of 250 million records, as well as being a successful actor. In 2017 she launched Fenty Beauty, and it's now a billion-dollar business. Even more importantly, it's has forced the beauty industry to up their inclusivity game. Rihanna had a strong sense of what was wrong with beauty and wasn't afraid to fix it. As Hsu-Ying Fullick, executive creative director at Landor, explains: ""Her tag line of 'beauty for all' was reflected in the debut of 40 foundation shades. She mandated that retailers stock the full range, refusing to allow her brand to be limited to lighter, more popular tones. This genuine commitment to diversity made waves, ensuring the brand was seen, noticed and celebrated."" ""Fenty didn't just sell makeup,"" he concludes. ""It sold a story that people could support. I also admired how the packaging was simple and clean, using sleek, minimal colours and graphics that supported rather than overpowered Rihanna's vision."" Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. ""There are many 'celebrity brands' where the famous face is simply an ambassador,"" adds Fura Johannesdottir, global CCO at Interbrand. ""Fenty Beauty could not be more different. It's Rihanna's brand vision with a strong purpose and she seems heavily involved."" And it's had a huge impact. ""Fenty Beauty changed the game in the beauty category by solving a real issue: the lack of inclusive makeup for all skin tones,"" Fura explains. ""Its darkest shade of foundation sold out almost immediately after the launch; clearly there was a real need for it."" Many celeb brands feel fake or performative. ""But Fenty still feels fresh due to its personality and genuineness,"" says Hsu-Ying. ""It reminds us that authenticity and purpose are the most powerful branding tools we can ever have."" 02. Jessica Alba: The Honest Company Jessica Alba made her name as an actor in TV drama Dark Angel and the Fantastic Four movies. But she's got serious business chops too. The Honest Company, which she launched in 2011, focuses on safe, eco-friendly products for babies and households. It's now pulling in record revenue of $378 million a year, reportedly making her more money than her entire Hollywood career. It's important to stress that she isn't phoning it in. ""This is not name-only endorsement,"" says Alan Young, joint CCO at St Luke's. ""Jessica Alba has been heavily involved in product development, read studies, hired scientists and experts, and spent three years developing the range before launch."" The brand positions itself as the trustworthy option in a market full of dodgy claims. As Jason Braddy, ECD at Elmwood Singapore, explains: ""It succeeded because it positioned itself as a challenger in a category filled with distrust. Jessica Alba's credibility as a parent, not just a celebrity, provides a strong and real emotional anchor that resonates with consumers. And consistency, distinctiveness, and best-in-class storytelling have all helped sell this story."" The visual branding is spot-on too, with Craig praising its simplicity and directness. ""At its heart is a roundel, locking together the Honest name and butterfly icon,"" he explains. ""This stamp of honest authority cuts through the clutter: a memorable reassurance of trust parents will keep coming back to. ""This simplicity allows the rest of the branding – cute colours and patterns – to pull products and ranges apart and complement aspirational nursery interiors."" 03. Emma Chamberlain: Chamberlain Coffee Emma Chamberlain is the YouTuber who pretty much invented the ""messy, relatable influencer"" aesthetic everyone's copying now. She has a huge Gen Z following, and a knack for making everything feel real and unfiltered. In 2019, she launched Chamberlain Coffee, and it's found a natural home in the youth market....","Remember when celebrity endorsements meant awkward TV ads with stars clutching products they'd probably never use?

18101791264574156,"  Seit einer Weile teste ich den Maybelline Lifter Glaze Lip Oil Balm in der Farbe Berry Haze. Erst hatte mich das Produkt irgendwie nicht so angesprochen, aber der niedrige Preis von rund 5 Euro und der kleine aber feine Hype auf Social Media haben dafür gesorgt, dass ich das Produkt dann doch mal mitgenommen habe. Ich war neulich erst erstaunt, dass ein ähnliches Produkt von Manhattan so viel teurer war, daher finde ich 5 Euro für Maybelline echt nicht zu teuer. Das Design vom Produkt ist schlicht, gefällt mir aber schon gut. Vielleicht hätte man das Packaging noch an die Farbe des Produkts anpassen können, aber wollen wir mal keine Wunder erwarten. Das Produkt verspricht Pflege und Farbe in einem und “zart getönte Lippen”. Nun habe ich eine relativ dunkle Farbe genommen, finde aber, dass es für mich eher zur Kategorie dekorative Kosmetik als zur Kategorie Lippenpflege gehört. Oftmals sind solche Lippenpflegestifte, die auch Farbe haben, eher störend und schmierig, das ist hier nicht der Fall. Trotzdem finde ich ""zart getönte Lippen"" trifft es irgendwie gut. Ich finde, dass man bei meiner Farbe einen sehr hübschen mavig/rosanen my lips but better Look bekommt, aber auch keinen super spiegelden Glosseffekt, nicht wie zum Beispiel bei Fenty Beauty. Dafür merkt man das Produkt aber auch kaum auf den Lippen, das ist sehr angenehm. Ich merke, dass ich immer wieder zum Lifter Glaze greife und zu ""Marktforschungszwecken"" (😜) habe ich jetzt auch noch eine zweite Farbe gekauft. Ich bin mal gespannt, wie meine Meinung dort ausfallen wird, denn die Farbe ist deutlich heller. All in all bin ich ein bisschen leidenschaftslos. Das Produkt gefällt mir gut. Ich greife immer wieder dazu, auch wenn ich nun wirklich auch andere Produkte da hätte. Die Farbe gefällt mir sehr gut und passt zu den meisten Makeups. Für den Preis kann man sich das auf jeden Fall mal anschauen, ist aber für mich jetzt kein weltbewegendes must-have Produkt. Kennt ihr die Lifter Glaze Lip Balms von Maybelline? Gefallen sie euch? Welche Farben habt ihr gekauft? #maybellinelifterglaze #maybelline #neuinderdrogerie #neubeidm #neubeirossmann #beautyblogger_de #lippenstiftliebe","Seit einer Weile teste ich den Maybelline Lifter Glaze Lip Oil Balm in der Farbe Berry Haze. Erst hatte mich das Produkt irgendwie nicht so angesprochen, aber der niedrige Preis von rund 5 Euro und der kleine aber feine Hype auf Social Media haben dafür gesorgt, dass ich das Produkt dann doch mal mitgenommen habe. Ich war neulich erst erstaunt, dass ein ähnliches Produkt von Manhattan so viel teurer war, daher finde ich 5 Euro für Maybelline echt nicht zu teuer. Das Design vom Produkt ist schlicht, gefällt mir aber schon gut. Vielleicht hätte man das Packaging noch an die Farbe des Produkts anpassen können, aber wollen wir mal keine Wunder erwarten. Das Produkt verspricht Pflege und Farbe in einem und “zart getönte Lippen”. Nun habe ich eine relativ dunkle Farbe genommen, finde aber, dass es für mich eher zur Kategorie dekorative Kosmetik als zur Kategorie Lippenpflege gehört. Oftmals sind solche Lippenpflegestifte, die auch Farbe haben, eher störend und schmierig, das ist hier nicht der Fall. Trotzdem finde ich ""zart getönte Lippen"" trifft es irgendwie gut. Ich finde, dass man bei meiner Farbe einen sehr hübschen mavig/rosanen my lips but better Look bekommt, aber auch keinen super spiegelden Glosseffekt, nicht wie zum Beispiel bei Fenty Beauty. Dafür merkt man das Produkt aber auch kaum auf den Lippen, das ist sehr angenehm. Ich merke, dass ich immer wieder zum Lifter Glaze greife und zu ""Marktforschungszwecken"" () habe ich jetzt auch noch eine zweite Farbe gekauft. Ich bin mal gespannt, wie meine Meinung dort ausfallen wird, denn die Farbe ist deutlich heller. All in all bin ich ein bisschen leidenschaftslos. Das Produkt gefällt mir gut.

  Adobe数据显示，美国在线销售在本周二（亚马逊Prime Day促销首日）同比大涨9.9%，达79亿美元，创下今年迄今为止“最大电商日”。 这一销售额不仅刷新了2024年记录，还超过了去年感恩节当天的61亿美元在线销售额。 回顾2023年和2024年的Prime会员日，全球销售表现可谓节节攀升。 2023年活动期间，全球Prime会员疯狂扫货超3.75亿件商品，首日甚至成为亚马逊史上单日销售最高的一天；2024年更是刷新纪录，全球第三方卖家仅用两天就卖出超2亿件商品。 Adobe Analytics预测，2025亚马逊Prime Day，美国在线消费（包括亚马逊和所有零售商）将达到238亿美元，比去年两天的142亿美元增长28.4%。 Prime Day首日，这些品类值得关注据媒体报道，2025年亚马逊Prime会员日在全球消费者的热切期待中盛大开启，首日战况异常激烈，众多卖家迎来爆单狂欢。 据亚马逊官方数据，全球销售额突破85亿美元，同比增长22%，远超2024年同期表现。 从品类维度拆解，电子产品以33%的销售额增速领跑全场，耳机、蓝牙扬声器等音频设备销量同比激增105%，部分品牌通过“Prime专享Z划算”活动实现单日销量翻20倍。 家居用品延续强势表现，泡沫床垫、洗衣液等大件商品交易总重量突破39吨，印证了亚马逊物流网络对高重量商品的承载能力。 值得关注的是，返校季商品成为黑马，背包、文具销售额飙升216%，儿童服装增长165%，显示出亚马逊对季节性消费节点的精准把控。 与往年48小时活动相比，2025年Prime Day首次延长至96小时，这一决策背后是亚马逊对流量分配机制的深度重构。 据Momentum Commerce分析，活动首六小时销售额同比增长13%，表明“开门红”效应显著；而延长周期使得长尾商品获得持续曝光机会，中小卖家通过“Z划算”活动实现日均销量增长300%。 尽管美国市场以78亿美元首日销售额占据绝对主导，但全球市场的分化趋势愈发明显。 Adobe预测，2025年Prime Day全球销售额将达238亿美元，其中美国贡献占比从2024年的78%微降至76%，而澳大利亚、印度等新兴市场增速显著。 数据显示，中国卖家的表现尤为亮眼。 欧洲站中国品牌SmallRig销量增长6.2倍，英国站Top10商品中中国品牌占据4席，显示出供应链优势与品牌化运营的双重效应。 在物流端，亚马逊AWD仓储服务通过“8折仓储费+9折运输费”的组合优惠，吸引超60%的中国卖家提前备货，确保活动期间库存周转率提升至行业均值的1.5倍。 接棒欧洲，TikTok Shop美区大促开启近日，TikTok Shop跨境电商欧洲夏季促销活动在英国以及欧盟四国（法国、德国、意大利、西班牙）正式完美收官。 据悉，此次促销中，欧盟四国成绩格外显著，多项数据创下新纪录。 尤其是欧盟四国商家自运营（POP）模式单日最高增幅超200%。 英区全托管商家GMV爆发超600%，商家自运营全周期GMV爆发超90%。 资料显示，这是TikTok Shop第二次举办夏季大促活动，而首次大促并未带来预期的销量增长。 据Modern Retail的数据，TikTok Shop在去年48小时的Prime Day促销中，商品交易总额（GMV）出现了6%的下滑。 外界普遍认为，去年促销的折扣力度较小是导致销量未达标的主要原因——当时TikTok Shop的平均折扣为18%，而亚马逊Prime Day的平均折扣则达到了22%。 然而，今年的情况发生了戏剧性的反转。 据悉，此次为期13天的TikTok大促（7月7日至7月19日）覆盖所有主流品类和知名品牌，包括Fenty Beauty、Crocs以及飞利浦等主力品牌，折扣力度高达50%。 特别是在TikTok Shop自行运营的POP模式下，欧盟四国市场的表现突破预期：其中自营商家单日峰值GMV增长超过200%，全周期GMV实现160%以上增长。 而平台达人内容也同步展现活力——达人直播成交同比增长达400%，短视频引导成交上涨215%，商品卡成交跃升135%，充分验证了内容电商在本地化运营下的巨大潜力。 同时，全托管模式（TOP）在欧洲同样取得显著成果。 欧盟市场TOP商家GMV当日激增122%，最高单日爆发也达200%。 而英国市场表现更为突出，全托管商家GMV同比增长超过600%。 尽管面临美国政府的加速出售压力，TikTok Shop美区市场仍展现出强劲的消费活力。 在6月的运营动荡中，静电除毛手套等应季商品逆势爆发，半月销量近万单，GMV 达6.65万美元，单条带货视频播放量突破600万次。 7月7日至19日，TikTok美区年中大促正式开启，护发精油、宠物用品等品类被平台列为重点推荐。 官方建议卖家提前储备短视频内容，并开通免费样品功能以应对潜在用户迁移风险。 据悉，此次大促沿用“内容+货架”双驱动模式，护发类商品凭借场景化测评视频转化率提升40%，宠物智能用品则依托达人开箱视频实现动销率超90%。 END来源：境商",SPR_COMBO[zh] Adobe数据显示，美国在线销售在本周二（亚马逊Prime Day促销首日）同比大涨9.9%，达79亿美元，创下今年迄今为止“最大电商日”。 这一销售额不仅刷新了2024年记录，还超过了去年感恩节当天的61亿美元在线销售额。 回顾2023年和2024年的Prime会员日，全球销售表现可谓节节攀升。 2023年活动期间，全球Prime会员疯狂扫货超3.75亿件商品，首日甚至成为亚马逊史上单日销售最高的一天；2024年更是刷新纪录，全球第三方卖家仅用两天就卖出超2亿件商品。 Adobe Analytics预测，2025亚马逊Prime Day，美国在线消费（包括亚马逊和所有零售商）将达到238亿美元，比去年两天的142亿美元增长28.4%。 Prime Day首日，这些品类值得关注据媒体报道，2025年亚马逊Prime会员日在全球消费者的热切期待中盛大开启，首日战况异常激烈，众多卖家迎来爆单狂欢。 据亚马逊官方数据，全球销售额突破85亿美元，同比增长22%，远超2024年同期表现。 从品类维度拆解，电子产品以33%的销售额增速领跑全场，耳机、蓝牙扬声器等音频设备销量同比激增105%，部分品牌通过“Prime专享Z划算”活动实现单日销量翻20倍。 家居用品延续强势表现，泡沫床垫、洗衣液等大件商品交易总重量突破39吨，印证了亚马逊物流网络对高重量商品的承载能力。 值得关注的是，返校季商品成为黑马，背包、文具销售额飙升216%，儿童服装增长165%，显示出亚马逊对季节性消费节点的精准把控。 与往年48小时活动相比，2025年Prime Day首次延长至96小时，这一决策背后是亚马逊对流量分配机制的深度重构。 据Momentum Commerce分析，活动首六小时销售额同比增长13%，表明“开门红”效应显著；而延长周期使得长尾商品获得持续曝光机会，中小卖家通过“Z划算”活动实现日均销量增长300%。 尽管美国市场以78亿美元首日销售额占据绝对主导，但全球市场的分化趋势愈发明显。 Adobe预测，2025年Prime Day全球销售额将达238亿美元，其中美国贡献占比从2024年的78%微降至76%，而澳大利亚、印度等新兴市场增速显著。 数据显示，中国卖家的表现尤为亮眼。 欧洲站中国品牌SmallRig销量增长6.2倍，英国站Top10商品中中国品牌占据4席，显示出供应链优势与品牌化运营的双重效应。 在物流端，亚马逊AWD仓储服务通过“8折仓储费+9折运输费”的组合优惠，吸引超60%的中国卖家提前备货，确保活动期间库存周转率提升至行业均值的1.5倍。 接棒欧洲，TikTok Shop美区大促开启近日，TikTok Shop跨境电商欧洲夏季促销活动在英国以及欧盟四国（法国、德国、意大利、西班牙）正式完美收官。 据悉，此次促销中，欧盟四国成绩格外显著，多项数据创下新纪录。 尤其是欧盟四国商家自运营（POP）模式单日最高增幅超200%。 英区全托管商家GMV爆发超600%，商家自运营全周期GMV爆发超90%。 资料显示，这是TikTok Shop第二次举办夏季大促活动，而首次大促并未带来预期的销量增长。 据Modern Retail的数据，TikTok Shop在去年48小时的Prime Day促销中，商品交易总额（GMV）出现了6%的下滑。 外界普遍认为，去年促销的折扣力度较小是导致销量未达标的主要原因——当时TikTok Shop的平均折扣为18%，而亚马逊Prime Day的平均折扣则达到了22%。 然而，今年的情况发生了戏剧性的反转。 据悉，此次为期13天的TikTok大促（7月7日至7月19日）覆盖所有主流品类和知名品牌，包括Fenty Beauty、Crocs以及飞利浦等主力品牌，折扣力度高达50%。 特别是在TikTok Shop自行运营的POP模式下，欧盟四国市场的表现突破预期：其中自营商家单日峰值GMV增长超过200%，全周期GMV实现160%以上增长。 而平台达人内容也同步展现活力——达人直播成交同比增长达400%，短视频引导成交上涨215%，商品卡成交跃升135%，充分验证了内容电商在本地化运营下的巨大潜力。 同时，全托管模式（TOP）在欧洲同样取得显著成果。 欧盟市场TOP商家GMV当日激增122%，最高单日爆发也达200%。 而英国市场表现更为突出，全托管商家GMV同比增长超过600%。 尽管面临美国政府的加速出售压力，TikTok Shop美区市场仍展现出强劲的消费活力。 在6月的运营动荡中，静电除毛手套等应季商品逆势爆发，半月销量近万单，GMV 达6.65万美元，单条带货视频播放量突破600万次。 7月7日至19日，TikTok美区年中大促正式开启，护发精油、宠物用品等品类被平台列为重点推荐。 官方建议卖家提前储备短视频内容，并开通免费样品功能以应对潜在用户迁移风险。 据悉，此次大促沿用“内容+货架”双驱动模式，护发类商品凭借场景化测评视频转化率提升40%，宠物智能用品则依托达人开箱视频实现动销率超90%。 END来源：境商,2025-07-16 08:32:47,zh,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The comment mentions Fenty Beauty as one of the key brands featured in the TikTok Shop summer promotion, specifically noting it was part of a 13-day sale with up to 50% discounts.

Borough Market 4.18am This is the exact time that my alarm goes off. I've calculated that gives me exactly enough time to be ready for the gym. I am woken up either by my phone alarm or my Whoop band. The first thing I do when I wake up is check my phone. It's bad, I know, but I need to check that there have been no disasters overnight that need my attention. I then brush my teeth and put on some SPF. Garnier Ambre Solaire SPF 50+ Sensitive Advanced Sun Cream Face & Body is my current go-to. My morning soundtrack is anything by Beyoncé, I love the latest album even more after seeing her live. I also take a shot of Symprove before I leave. 4.50am My gym is only a six-minute drive from my house. In summer I wear shorts and a bra top to work out in. Most of my kit comes from lululemon, Oner Active and Sweaty Betty. I work out a minimum of five times a week, mixing it up with cardio, strength training and PT sessions. When I am strength training, I wear Nike Metcons and for running, I wear Nike Journey. 6am I have my protein shake as soon as I get back from the gym. It's a mixture of protein powder, collagen and creatine with water. I then go and give my children a cuddle before heading into the shower. My favourite body wash is Naturium The Glow Getter  Body Wash  followed by the body butter. I go in quickly with a spritz of my favourite scent, Encelade by Marc-Antoine Barrois. On my face, I use Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant followed by Koba moisturiser. Make-up starts with Danessa Myricks Beauty Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder and I always use Fenty's  foundation – it's the best. I use the By Terry eye liner and I mix blushers from Merit and NARS. Finally, I set everything with Charlotte Tilbury's setting spray and in the evenings, I use the one from ONE/SIZE. 7am I'm definitely a magpie but my style is also defined by clean lines. I find Lisa Ing Marinelli's take on fashion really inspiring – she's someone who also has a corporate job but embraces her personal style. If I had an endless budget, I would go to Tove every season. I just bought one of my favourite summer dresses from the brand. I'm also a big fan of Rejina Pyo. On the high street, I love COS and Massimo Dutti. I only give myself about ten minutes to get dressed before I have to leave the house – either to get the kids to school or catch the train to work....","Breadcrumbs Life Image: . asare Life 18 July 2025 As a managing partner at OMD UK, founder of My Bump Pay, author of 'The Blend' and a passionate advocate for working parents, Tobi Asare wears many hats – often all before lunch.

mov_161D74D2CBDFD8D77F3E3AD63CBFC8B0,"  After breaking up with her billionaire fiancé, Mariah Carey reportedly sued him for a $50 million ""inconvenience fee!"" According to Forbes, there are 3,028 billionaires in the world as of 2025. While that number may have average people shouting, ""Eat the rich!"" , some celebrities see it as a potential dating pool. Here are 35 celebrities who dated or married billionaires and their heirs: 1. Camila Cabello was first romantically linked to Henry Junior Chalhoub — who's an heir to the billionaire Chalhoub family — in January 2025. The Chalhoub family founded the Chalhoub Group, a distribution company for luxury fashion. It's based in Dubai. According to Forbes, the family was worth $1.7 billion as of 2019. 2. After a few months of dating, Mariah Carey got engaged to investor James Packer in 2016. They broke up eight months later. According to Forbes, his net worth is $3.4 billion. Following their split, Mariah reportedly sued James for a $50 million ""inconvenience fee"" but settled in the neighborhood of $5–$10 million. She also got to keep her $10 million engagement ring. 3. From 2018–2022, Kaley Cuoco was married to equestrian Karl Cook, the son of Intuit founder Scott Cook. According to Forbes, Scott's net worth is $7.7 billion. In 2016, Kaley and Karl met at a horse show and bonded over their mutual love of animals. In 2021, they announced they were separating because they ""realized that [their] current paths have taken [them] in opposite directions."" 4. A$AP Rocky has been with billionaire singer and businessperson Rihanna since 2020. In 2021, Forbes reported that she achieved billionaire status largely through Fenty Beauty, the makeup brand she launched in partnership with LVMH in 2017. Another large chunk of her wealth — in the neighborhood of $270 million — comes from her stake in Savage x Fenty, the lingerie brand she started in 2018. She's reportedly worth $1 billion. 5. Before becoming a billionaire herself, Rihanna dated Hassan Jameel from 2017–2020. His family — who own the largest Toyota distribution company in several parts of the Middle East, Abdul Latif Jameel — was reportedly worth a collective $2.2 billion in 2017. 6. In 2018, Karlie Kloss married billionaire venture capitalist Josh Kushner. He founded the firm Thrive Capital in 2009 and has invested in companies like Instagram, Instacart, Zola, and Robinhood. Per Forbes, he's worth $3.8 billion. 7. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has been dating billionaire singer Taylor Swift since 2023. According to Forbes, Taylor was the first musician to achieve billionaire status predominantly through her music and performances. She was added to the list in October 2023, largely because of her music catalog and the Eras Tour. Her net worth is $1.6 billion. 8. In 2019, YouTube star Gigi Gorgeous married model/designer Nats Getty, who's the great-grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. Forbes clocked the Getty family's net worth at $5.4 billion in 2015. They met at Paris Fashion Week 2016 when they closed the show put on by August Getty, Nats's brother and Gigi's best friend. However, they filed for divorce in 2025. 9. Brooklyn Peltz Beckham married actor/heiress Nicola Peltz Beckham in 2022. They first met at Coachella in 2017 when one of her brothers introduced them. However, they were both in relationships at the time, but despite not really getting along, they kept in touch. Fast-forward to 2019, and they crossed paths again at Leonardo DiCaprio's Halloween party. The following January, they made things Instagram official.
