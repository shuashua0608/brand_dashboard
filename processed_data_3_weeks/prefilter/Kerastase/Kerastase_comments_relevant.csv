The Bangas, among Nykaa's earliest investors, are offloading about 60 million shares at an offer price of ₹200 per share, a 5.5% discount to the latest closing price, the term sheet showed. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are managing the transaction. Banga, Nykaa, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to Mint's requests for comment. Banga, a commodities billionaire and chairman of Hong Kong-based Caravel Group, held an 8.7% stake in Nykaa before it listed in 2021. The Nayar family, who founded the company, still owns 52% and has not sold any shares since the IPO.

Revenue from operations rose 23.61% to ₹2,061.76 crore from ₹1,667.98 crore in FY24.

Nykaa is now shifting toward a more profitable growth trajectory, aiming for mid-20% annual growth in its beauty and personal care (BPC) business over the next five years. The strategy includes deeper market penetration, premiumization, and enhanced convenience. The company plans to scale its physical footprint across tier 2 and 3 cities, increasing store count from 237 to over 500 by FY30.

mov_408C8841FD20D09DE4E9C70A8AD0C192,"  Updated 3 July 2025 at 13:09 IST The total value of the transaction is estimated to be in the range of Rs 1,200 crore, as per multiple media reports. Investment banks Goldman Sachs (India) Securities and JP Morgan India were reportedly appointed as placement agents for the deal. Shares of FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd, the parent company of beauty and fashion retailer Nykaa, slipped sharply on Thursday, weighed down by a large block deal involving one of its early investors. The stock fell nearly 5 percent in early trade, touching an intraday low of around Rs 201 on the NSE, amid heightened selling pressure on the bourses. As per media reports, Harindarpal Singh Banga along with Indra Banga, offloaded approximately six crore shares in the company through bulk transactions. The deal was executed at a floor price of Rs 200 per share, which is around around 5 percent below Wednesday's closing price of Rs 211.59—triggering a swift reaction from investors. The total value of the transaction is estimated to be in the range of Rs 1,200 crore, as per multiple media reports. Investment banks Goldman Sachs (India) Securities and JP Morgan India were reportedly appointed as placement agents for the deal. Harindarpal Singh Banga, the founder of the Hong Kong-based Caravel Group, held an 8.7 per cent stake in Nykaa prior to the company's stock market debut in 2021. The Nayar family, who established the brand, continues to hold a controlling stake of 52 per cent and has not divested any shares since the IPO. This recent sale follows a similar move nearly a year ago, when Banga sold four crore shares—equivalent to a 1.43 per cent stake—at a price of Rs 208.30 per share in August. That transaction reduced his ownership from 6.40% to 4.97%. Robust financial results Despite Thursday's share price drop, Nykaa has posted solid financial performance in recent quarters. The company reported a three-fold jump in net profit for the March quarter, which rose to Rs 20 crore. For the full financial year, net profit more than doubled to Rs 66 crore, underpinned by continued strength in its beauty and personal care verticals. Expansion plans on track Over the last one year, Nykaa has introduced an unprecedented number of international beauty labels to the Indian market through new partnerships with globally renowned names such as Yves Saint Laurent, NARS, Kerastase, Eucerin, GHD, Armani Beauty, Supergoop, and Nexxus, among others. As it enters its next phase of expansion, the company is focused on driving sustainable profitability. It is targeting a mid-20 percent compound annual growth rate in its beauty and personal care (BPC) segment over the next five years. In parallel, Nykaa is looking to strengthen its offline footprint by scaling up its presence in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. The retailer plans to grow its physical store network from the current 237 locations to over 500 by FY30. This site is part of Republic World and Republic Media Network","Updated 3 July 2025 at 13:09 IST The total value of the transaction is estimated to be in the range of Rs 1,200 crore, as per multiple media reports. Investment banks Goldman Sachs (India) Securities and JP Morgan India were reportedly appointed as placement agents for the deal. Shares of FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd, the parent company of beauty and fashion retailer Nykaa, slipped sharply on Thursday, weighed down by a large block deal involving one of its early investors. The stock fell nearly 5 percent in early trade, touching an intraday low of around Rs 201 on the NSE, amid heightened selling pressure on the bourses. As per media reports, Harindarpal Singh Banga along with Indra Banga, offloaded approximately six crore shares in the company through bulk transactions. The deal was executed at a floor price of Rs 200 per share, which is around around 5 percent below Wednesday's closing price of Rs 211.59—triggering a swift reaction from investors. The total value of the transaction is estimated to be in the range of Rs 1,200 crore, as per multiple media reports. Investment banks Goldman Sachs (India) Securities and JP Morgan India were reportedly appointed as placement agents for the deal. Harindarpal Singh Banga, the founder of the Hong Kong-based Caravel Group, held an 8.7 per cent stake in Nykaa prior to the company's stock market debut in 2021. The Nayar family, who established the brand, continues to hold a controlling stake of 52 per cent and has not divested any shares since the IPO.

She thinks it's embarrassing and frankly I doubt Jennifer Aniston really uses “her product” on her own hair. I used to be able to find Giovanni at Whole Foods (I know!) or my local food co-op. Now I order it online. I like it because it's alcohol free. So many hair care products contain various of alcohol yet claim to be moisturizing and good for color treated hair. But you need to look for products that aren't filled with chemicals that do the opposite of moisturizing despite what they claim. Kerastase and many products sold in salons and beauty stores are like this too. Fancy packaging and perfume so you'll keep buying more.

I've been covering Amazon Prime Day – or Amazon Prime Big Deal Days Sale, as it's called in the autumn – for the past five years. So, I like to think I know a good deal when I see one. This time around, I've spotted the lowest ever prices on countless editor-approved buys – across beauty, perfume, clothing, sex toys, and Amazon bestsellers. From some pretty high-end brands, too. July Prime Day started at 00:01 today, and ends at midnight on July 11 (that's this Thursday, people). That means two things. First, it's time to declutter those overflowing beauty cupboards –we've all got products we haven't used in months, only to discover they're already expired. Second, we need to act with swiftness if we don't want to miss out on the best prices. The sale event is obviously great for tech – there are deals on everything from the Duux Whisper Flex Smart Standing Fan to keep you cool and the Ninja Artisan Electric Outdoor Pizza Oven for alfresco dining to Alexa voice-controlled smart home devices, HDR TVs, chargers and adapters – but it isn't just an ocean of discount gadgets. Amazon has also served up a huge range of Spotlight Sales and Lightning Deals across every category you can possibly think of. With more and more brands jumping into the Prime Day frenzy, sorting through the endless deals can feel like a full-time job. We've all been there – that pair of cleansing wristbands collecting dust at the back of your beauty cupboard, or the extra flip-flops squeezed into an already overflowing shoe rack, silent souvenirs of impulse buys. So how do you shop smart and come out ahead? That's where we come in. Sure, we might occasionally get sidetracked during a Netflix binge (snack breaks happen), but when it comes to shopping, the GLAMOUR UK team is locked in. We've gathered all our top tips to help you shop Amazon Prime Day like a pro – whether you're diving in today, browsing over the weekend, or saving your big buys for next week's main event. Over the past few years, we've been to press days, tested endless so-called ""best buys,"" and chatted with your favourite brands – so this guide is a thoughtfully curated edit of sales picks you can truly trust.

Scouted selects products independently. If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission. Amazon has officially kicked off its annual Prime Day event, and the deals are some of the best we've seen all year long. Amazon Prime Day runs from Tuesday, July 8, through Friday, July 11 (the longest Prime Day ever!) , with thousands of Black Friday-level markdowns—including plenty of beauty deals on masstige, drugstore, and premium brands. Many of the featured beauty brands on sale (NuFace, iS Clinical, Too Faced, Estee Lauder, and many others) right now rarely get marked down, so this is the perfect opportunity to stock up on some of your pricier holy grail products or treat yourself to a new splurge without the dreaded buyer's remorse from paying full price. Scroll through below to check out a few discounted beauty items our editors are adding to their carts during this extended Amazon Prime Day event. Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Face SerumThere's a reason why this legendary anti-aging serum has been a cult-favorite for decades—it actually works—and does so without destroying your skin barrier. I rarely see this tried-and-true formula marked down, but right now, you can score a bottle for under $60. Too Faced Cloud Crush BlushDown From $31A powder blush that blurs fine lines, textures, and pores without compromising color payoff and staying power? Yes, such a thing does exist. Too Faced Cloud Crush Blush is the perfect cheek formula for those who love the effect of a cream blush but prefer a more velvet finish that lasts all day long. iS Clinical Active SerumThis multipurpose facial serum is an aesthetician favorite thanks to its ability to address acne, discoloration, fine lines, and virtually any skin concern one may have. The “results-oriented” serum is powered by a potent cocktail of, you guessed it, active ingredients, including vitamin A, salicylic acid, and aloe, to counteract irritation. This clinical brand doesn't go on sale often, so stock up while it's 20 percent off. Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD Lash Enhancing SerumDown from $36I have been a loyal fan of Grande Cosmetics' brow and lash-enhancing serums since I first tried them a few years ago. This lash serum works—and fast—without causing me irritation.Paula's Choice SKIN Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid ExfoliantDown From $35I was introduced to Paula's Choice by a dermatologist who recommended this BHA Exfoliant for my congested pores and budding crow's feet almost five years ago now, and it's still a staple I use nearly every single day. While the dark spot-earing elixir is reasonably priced in my book, I'll be stockpiling while it's 20 percent off. Kerastase Premiere Anti-Breakage MaskDown From $68Whether from bleach abuse or years of heat tool use, if your hair could use a little extra TLC, this spendy mask is where it's at. Yes, it's a splurge, but right now, you can grab a jar of this miracle cream for 20 percent off. LANEIGE Lip Sleeping MaskDown From $24There's a reason this Korean beauty lip mask is one of Amazon's bestsellers (and a viral TikTok product). Not only is it rich and hydrating without being sticky or oily, but it also doubles as a primer for lip products. Of course, you can use this before bed or as a lip balm during the day for ultra-soft lips. Murad Retinal ReSculpt Overnight TreatmentDown From $104This vitamin-A anti-aging serum is the closest thing to a facelift in a bottle. Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth every penny—especially when it's on sale. It's a great alternative to prescription-strength retinoids (e.g., Retin-A and Tretinoin), but it is more gentle.Oribe Dry Texturizing SprayDown From $52If I could only use one hair styling product for the rest of my life, it would undoubtedly be Oribe's iconic Dry Texturizing Spray. It smells incredible, isn't sticky, makes your locks look effortlessly sexy, and absorbs extra oil without overdrying or leaving behind a dusty residue. It never gets discounted, so take advantage of this limited-time deal. Le Prunier Plum Beauty Oil Superfood Antioxidant BoosterDown From $72This multitasking facial oil is one of the best-smelling skincare products I've ever smelled, but that's not why I always keep it stocked. The beautiful facial oil not only gives you a major glow while locking in moisture, but it also delivers a surge of antioxidants into the skin for reduced fine lines, texture, and discoloration. BeautyStat Universal C Skin Refiner Broad Spectrum SPF50Down From $125Founded by renowned cosmetic chemist Ron Robinson, BeautyStat's clinically backed and scientifically formulated skincare products never disappoint. I'm super picky about vitamin C serums because they tend to make my skin freak out, but this formula is magic in a bottle. Not only does it firm, brighten, and smooth, but it also helps prevent and correct free radical damage without causing redness, overdrying, or peeling. Grab a bottle for yourself while it's on sale. Fekkai Blonde Rx Anti-Brass Repair MaskDown From $48If you're a bottle blonde like me, you know that while purple shampoos can be a major help with keeping brass at bay, they're also incredibly drying. Bleach (or any lightener) already tends to dry your strands, leading to breakage and split ends, which is why I love Fekkai's Blonde Rx Anti-Brass Repair Mask. Not only does the hydrating mask repair damage and fortify weakened ends, but it also subtly tones your hair, helping to eliminate unwanted warmth. If you're a blonde, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this game-changing mask while it's on sale.Dickinson's Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Facial CleanserDown From $10I've used Dickinson's Original Witch Hazel toners since I was a pre-teen to keep my oily-combo skin in check. Now that I'm in my thirties, though, I need something a bit more gentle, and the brand's new Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Facial Cleanser delivers the benefits of an astringent without overdrying. NuFACE Trinity Starter Kit Microcurrent Facial Toning DeviceDown from $340NuFace is offering 30 percent off a selection of their coveted facial toning devices, including the original starter kit and the mini starter kit. If you've been waiting for the right time to invest in this facial slimming tool, now's your opportunity.Lavanila Clean Pure Vanilla PerfumeDown from $48I've been wearing this warm, sexy, but not-too-sweet vanilla fragrance on and off for years, and I always make sure to restock it when it goes on sale. Right now, you can take 20 percent off all the brand's cult-favorite natural fragrances and candles.","From NuFace to Estee Lauder, there are a lot of premium beauty deals to choose from during Amazon's four-day Prime Day sale—all of which are up to 30 percent off.

If you're a blonde, do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this game-changing mask while it's on sale.Dickinson's Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Facial CleanserDown From $10I've used Dickinson's Original Witch Hazel toners since I was a pre-teen to keep my oily-combo skin in check. Now that I'm in my thirties, though, I need something a bit more gentle, and the brand's new Original Witch Hazel Pore Perfecting Facial Cleanser delivers the benefits of an astringent without overdrying. NuFACE Trinity Starter Kit Microcurrent Facial Toning DeviceDown from $340NuFace is offering 30 percent off a selection of their coveted facial toning devices, including the original starter kit and the mini starter kit. If you've been waiting for the right time to invest in this facial slimming tool, now's your opportunity.Lavanila Clean Pure Vanilla PerfumeDown from $48I've been wearing this warm, sexy, but not-too-sweet vanilla fragrance on and off for years, and I always make sure to restock it when it goes on sale.

Amazon has officially kicked off its annual Prime Day event, and the deals are some of the best we've seen all year long. Amazon Prime Day runs from Tuesday, July 8, through Friday, July 11 (the longest Prime Day ever!) , with thousands of Black Friday-level markdowns—including plenty of beauty deals on masstige, drugstore, and premium brands. Many of the featured beauty brands on sale (NuFace, iS Clinical, Too Faced, Estee Lauder, and many others) right now rarely get marked down, so this is the perfect opportunity to stock up on some of your pricier holy grail products or treat yourself to a new splurge without the dreaded buyer's remorse from paying full price. Scroll through below to check out a few discounted beauty items our editors are adding to their carts during this extended Amazon Prime Day event. Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Face SerumThere's a reason why this legendary anti-aging serum has been a cult-favorite for decades—it actually works—and does so without destroying your skin barrier. I rarely see this tried-and-true formula marked down, but right now, you can score a bottle for under $60. See At Amazon Free Shipping Too Faced Cloud Crush BlushDown From $31A powder blush that blurs fine lines, textures, and pores without compromising color payoff and staying power? Yes, such a thing does exist. Too Faced Cloud Crush Blush is the perfect cheek formula for those who love the effect of a cream blush but prefer a more velvet finish that lasts all day long. See At Amazon Free Shipping iS Clinical Active SerumThis multipurpose facial serum is an aesthetician favorite thanks to its ability to address acne, discoloration, fine lines, and virtually any skin concern one may have. The “results-oriented” serum is powered by a potent cocktail of, you guessed it, active ingredients, including vitamin A, salicylic acid, and aloe, to counteract irritation. This clinical brand doesn't go on sale often, so stock up while it's 20 percent off. See At Amazon Free Shipping Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD Lash Enhancing SerumDown from $36I have been a loyal fan of Grande Cosmetics' brow and lash-enhancing serums since I first tried them a few years ago. This lash serum works—and fast—without causing me irritation.See At Amazon Free Returns | Free Shipping Paula's Choice SKIN Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid ExfoliantDown From $35I was introduced to Paula's Choice by a dermatologist who recommended this BHA Exfoliant for my congested pores and budding crow's feet almost five years ago now, and it's still a staple I use nearly every single day. While the dark spot-earing elixir is reasonably priced in my book, I'll be stockpiling while it's 20 percent off. See At Amazon Kerastase Premiere Anti-Breakage MaskDown From $68Whether from bleach abuse or years of heat tool use, if your hair could use a little extra TLC, this spendy mask is where it's at. Yes, it's a splurge, but right now, you can grab a jar of this miracle cream for 20 percent off. See At Amazon Free Shipping LANEIGE Lip Sleeping MaskDown From $24There's a reason this Korean beauty lip mask is one of Amazon's bestsellers (and a viral TikTok product). Not only is it rich and hydrating without being sticky or oily, but it also doubles as a primer for lip products. Of course, you can use this before bed or as a lip balm during the day for ultra-soft lips.See At Amazon Free Returns | Free Shipping Murad Retinal ReSculpt Overnight TreatmentDown From $104This vitamin-A anti-aging serum is the closest thing to a facelift in a bottle. Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth every penny—especially when it's on sale. It's a great alternative to prescription-strength retinoids (e.g., Retin-A and Tretinoin), but it is more gentle.See At Amazon Free Returns | Free Shipping Oribe Dry Texturizing SprayDown From $52If I could only use one hair styling product for the rest of my life, it would undoubtedly be Oribe's iconic Dry Texturizing Spray. It smells incredible, isn't sticky, makes your locks look effortlessly sexy, and absorbs extra oil without overdrying or leaving behind a dusty residue. It never gets discounted, so take advantage of this limited-time deal. See At Amazon Free Shipping Le Prunier Plum Beauty Oil Superfood Antioxidant BoosterDown From $72This multitasking facial oil is one of the best-smelling skincare products I've ever smelled, but that's not why I always keep it stocked. The beautiful facial oil not only gives you a major glow while locking in moisture, but it also delivers a surge of antioxidants into the skin for reduced fine lines, texture, and discoloration. See At Amazon Free Shipping BeautyStat Universal C Skin Refiner Broad Spectrum SPF50Down From $125Founded by renowned cosmetic chemist Ron Robinson, BeautyStat's clinically backed and scientifically formulated skincare products never disappoint. I'm super picky about vitamin C serums because they tend to make my skin freak out, but this formula is magic in a bottle....","Scouted selects products independently.

Featuring 75+ global brands and exciting new launches, this year's event celebrates bold, inclusive, and conscious beauty choices that reflect how we shop and express beauty today.
