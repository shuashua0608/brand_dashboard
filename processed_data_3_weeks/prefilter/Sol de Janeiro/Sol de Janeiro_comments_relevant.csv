mov_F6CC68ADAE8559C3EE972E8EFE74F497,"  From a filler-free body oil to an SPF you can apply over your makeup, these affordable faves are about to earn lifelong residency in your routine. 1. Peach Slices Redness Relief Color Correcting Cream for those days when your skin seems to be pitching a fit about something or another. This not only provides soothing, moisturizing ingredients like aloe and green algae, but it also has a subtle color-correcting tint that tones down redness. Think of it as a little tube of damage control for when your skin needs extra TLC. Promising review: ""I'm not one to normally leave reviews, but this is worth it. I've literally had this product for two days. I have severe rosacea on my nose. It's so bad I usually have to wear foundation to hide it because it's so noticeable. I've tried numerous products and serums with no luck, and honestly, I didn't expect this one to be any different. However, after only two days (probably applying it 4–5 times), almost all of the redness is gone! I'm in disbelief at the wonders it has done. I will without a doubt be stocking up on this product!"" —Tiffany Price: $19.88 2. Neutrogena Collagen Bank Facial Moisturizer that's basically an investment in your future face. Collagen helps keep things pinchably plump, bouncy, and glowy, which is great. But the real power player in this cream is the bakuchiol — an active ingredient which can boost cell turnover and smooth skin texture — which is basically retinol's less dramatic cousin. No joke, this study suggests that bakuchiol is just as effective as retinol while being way less likely to cause irritation. So basically, you get all the glow with none of the drama. It's a win-win. Promising review: ""The Neutrogena Collagen Bank moisturizer is making my skin feel smoother. It does not irritate my skin, and I really like the dispenser. I plan to keep using it."" —Serendipity Price: $19.97 (originally $22.97) 3. Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream because your skincare routine doesn't stop at your neck. It smells like summer vacation in a tub — think vanilla, salted caramel, and pistachio — and the fast-absorbing formula is infused with caffeine-rich guarana extract to visibly smooth and tighten. Your group chat will be demanding a scent rundown. Promising review: ""My skin is usually sensitive to anything with fragrances, this on the other hand, is perfect. It leaves my skin soft, and the fragrance ISN'T overpowering like other products. I would say over the span of a week or so I noticed a drastic improvement in my skin!"" —anonymous Price: $19.99+ (available in two sizes) 4. Aquaphor Lip Repair Ointment to rescue your lips when they feel like they've survived a beating. With a powerhouse blend of shea butter, beeswax, vitamin E, and chamomile, this ultra-soothing balm helps restore moisture, calms irritation, and keeps flakes at bay. Stop peeling and start slathering. Promising review: ""This product is highly recommended for maintaining moisture or replenishing moisture to chapped lips. I have sold lip conditioners that were 20 bucks. No need to pay that much money. Use this!"" —Tina Price: $8.36 for two 5.

788194AC4F6EE38BAA09391FD01E85A6,"  In a 49-page lawsuit filed in California, Lululemon accused the retail wholesaler of selling knockoff versions of its Scuba clothing and popular ABC men's pants. For nearly as long as mankind has worn fancy things, someone out there has been trying to copy those things. Ancient artisans cribbed from each other's designs. Victorian hustlers duped diamond jewelry with shimmery paste. Christian Dior, the godfather of high fashion himself, was believed to sell his own designs to lesser known producers, who could make cheaper versions. For the modern athleisure giant Lululemon, however, the duping has gone too far. In a lawsuit filed in California on June 25, the company accused the wholesale retailer Costco of selling knockoff sweatshirts, jackets and other activewear at a fraction of what Lululemon charges. Successfully suing over knockoffs is notoriously difficult for fashion brands and designers, in part because copyright laws are often vague, experts say. Lululemon's case seeks restitution and payment from Costco, which it said profited off Lululemon's ''sweat equity'' and damaged the Lululemon brand. Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. What is Lululemon accusing Costco of doing? Lululemon said Costco is selling knockoffs of its Scuba hoodies and sweatshirts, Define jackets and popular ABC pants for men. Using design images and side-by-side comparisons, Lululemon, in a 49-page court filing, argued that Costco sold jackets and hoodies -- made by clothing manufacturers such as Danskin, Spyder and Jockey -- using terms in its marketing similar to what Lululemon uses. In one instance cited in the lawsuit, Costco sold a turquoise Danskin-made pullover -- which at a glance looks remarkably similar to Lululemon's Scuba sweatshirt -- with the color ''Tidewater Teal.'' It's the same way Lululemon describes the color of its own teal sweatshirts. Lululemon also accuses Costco of manufacturing a knockoff of its ABC pants -- which retail for about $130 -- under Costco's own brand, Kirkland, and selling them for $20. Contracts between vendors like Danskin and Jockey and retailers like Costco often include provisions like indemnification clauses, which can specify that vendors bear financial responsibility for legal issues that could arise from their products. It's unclear whether such clauses exist in this case. How has Lululemon dealt with dupes? Lululemon, with its unadorned styles and high prices, is famously a target for knockoffs. Hashtags on TikTok direct shoppers to cheap, duped versions of the brand's leggings and athletic wear. Since Lululemon's inception in Canada in 1998, fashion law experts in America say that the brand has been on the forefront of design trademark law, which is famously lax in the United States as compared to other markets, like Europe. ''They absolutely have been on the forefront of trying to find ways to protect their intellectual property,'' said Susan Scafidi, the founder and director of the Fashion Law Institute at the Fordham School of Law. Protecting trademarks, logos and labels is one thing. Protecting the design of a garment is another.'' ''In Europe that's easy. Design rights, done,'' said Ms. Scafidi. '' In the U.S., well in Lululemon terms, they have to warm up and stretch.'' Still, dupes are enough of a concern that Lululemon held several ''dupe'' exchanges in 2023, offering holders of confirmed ''dupe'' leggings to bring their clothes to designated sites and trade them for the real thing. At the time, Nikki Neuburger, Lululemon's chief branding officer, said it was an effort to acknowledge ''dupes'' as part of fashion while protecting the original producer. ''We saw it as a really fun way to play into something that is a real part of our culture, but in a way that really puts the focus back on the original,'' Ms. Neuburger told CNN. What is 'dupe' culture? Many millennials probably recall a school or family trip to New York City in the 2000s, when a coveted status symbol of adolescence was a pair of sunglasses or a candy-colored knockoff designer purse, bought after haggling with a vendor on Canal Street. But today's dupe market has gone digital, and TikTok has become a prime platform. Videos with the ''dupe'' hashtag have billions of views on the platform. For many in Gen Z, good dupes have become almost as coveted as originals. Many influencers promote knockoffs of Stanley mugs, Lululemon pants, sneakers and designer jewelry. ''Dupes are not only out there in the open, they are a point of pride. These are the modern versions of being an extreme coupon clipper or a bargain hunter, and it has lost a lot of its shame,'' Ms. Scafidi said. But designers are increasingly trying to stamp out knockoffs, and take back brands' power. In November 2024, Sol de Janeiro sued over dupes of its popular scented mist sprays. The year before that, Deckers, which owns the Ugg boot brand, sued over dupes of its ankle shearling boot. This May, Deckers sued Costco over the same thing, claiming the retailer's far cheaper Shearling slippers were a direct copy of the UGG equivalent. If the Lululemon suit succeeds, Ms. Scafidi said, it could rewind some of that clock, making original designer versions once again palatable. ''Lulu is trying to buy back some of that territory,'' Ms. Scafidi said. If they win, ''that will be a huge social victory.''","In a 49-page lawsuit filed in California, Lululemon accused the retail wholesaler of selling knockoff versions of its Scuba clothing and popular ABC men's pants.

Love it as they get to be in the water as well; this product also dries very quickly. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be in the water with their children. An added benefit is that you are hands free!"" —Hannabelle Price: $89.99 (available in six colors) 2.

Promising review: ""My husband is a Master Mechanic and obviously works with different oils, greases, and fluids. Even though I use really good detergent, stain booster, and good liquid softener along with a pre-wash, it never seemed like I could get all of the smells out. Not now, this product is amazing!!!

And it's Sol de Janeiro, so you know it smells amazing. Duh! Promising review: ""I use this on vacation every time. As a Black girl, it makes my skin GLOWWWW! and the SPF is great, and I feel protected always."" —Jilly Price: $30 4. A lavender-scented Downy laundry odor remover to really get into the fibers of your clothing and linens to remove odor-causing residue. If you're sweating up a storm in the warmer months or stinking up your clothes in front of a campfire (worth it for the s'mores, tho!) , you'll wanna keep this on hand. Promising review: ""My husband is a Master Mechanic and obviously works with different oils, greases, and fluids. Even though I use really good detergent, stain booster, and good liquid softener along with a pre-wash, it never seemed like I could get all of the smells out. Not now, this product is amazing!!! My husband's work clothes come out smelling so fresh! I was actually supposed to, but it really does a great job.

While I'm not saying I'm proud of it, I've never been a religious sunscreen user. While I do stay indoors most of the time (bring on the gloomy fall weather, please!) , sunscreen is a key step in my skincare routine when I'm going to be in the sun—especially during vacation. The last sunburn I got in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, stained my back for months, so lesson learned. Given that I've never been a diehard sunscreen enthusiast, I've never had a solid favorite. I recently got into the Sol de Janeiro Rio Radiance Body Spray SPF 50 because it has such a unique summer scent of Cheirosa '97, and it applies effortlessly. Of course, I've used the viral Vacation Sunscreen Classic Whip SPF 30 because what kind of beauty writer would I be otherwise? But when it comes to the face, it wasn't until my first Candela Matrix Pro radiofrequency microneedling treatment that I found my go-to sunscreen. The team at Candela sent me off with a goodie bag filled with post-microneedling care must-haves: Cetaphil Daily Oil-Free Hydrating Lotion and my new go-to SPF, La Roche-Posay's Anthelios Sunscreen-Gentle Lotion. La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen-Gentle Lotion “Mineral sunscreens like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen-Gentle Lotion have zinc or titanium dioxide, which are active mineral ingredients that protect the skin from UV rays,” explains Beauty Villa Vergara founder Dr. Mariana Vergara, who performed the three-session radiofrequency microneedling treatment on me. “They sit on the top of the skin and reflect the UV radiation, acting like a physical barrier. These types of sunscreens are recommended for sensitive skin or for its use after treatments like microneedling radiofrequency.” Buy At Dermstore$26 Buy At Amazon$26 Free Returns | Free Shipping Aside from being post-procedure-approved, Vergara says that this affordable sunscreen, which targets both UVA and UVB rays, is an especially solid option for users with oily skin, thanks to the inclusion of lipo hydroxy acid, which can help keep breakouts and shine at bay. “[Lipo Hydroxy Acid] is a derivative of salicylic acid, and it can renew oily skin,” she says. “It also contains vitamin E, which is a great antioxidant that helps neutralize free radicals,” she says. Given Vergara's approval, along with hundreds of glowing reviews from Amazon shoppers, I knew I had a winner in my hands—and after using it consistently for a few weeks, I understand the hype. Not only did it protect my skin from the sun post-treatment (when the skin is extra sensitive to light), but my makeup went on extremely smoothly over the SPF—and it stayed in place for hours. I've gone on to take it with me everywhere, but the product was really put to the test on my birthday when I stayed at the stunning Casa Del Mar in sunny Santa Monica. I slathered on the SPF from head to toe and spent the day lounging by the pool, with an early evening seaside stroll on the sand before dinner. Despite the hot temps, I piled my makeup on strong over the gentle sunscreen. To my surprise, the SPF helped keep my makeup looking smooth and velvety (no excess shine!) throughout the day, and I was left with not a burn in sight. Three months after regular use, I've decided that not only does the non-greasy SPF protect my face and body, but it truly does serve as a remarkable makeup primer as well, which is one less product I have to pack with me when I travel. I may not use this SPF every single day, but when I do reach for a sunscreen, La Roche-Posay's Anthelios Sunscreen-Gentle Lotion is the one I grab.

mov_27D5CAF6F05A62CD128CE9E1F5F3E24C,"  The sales on these beloved products could be gone before Prime Day is even over. Amazon Prime Day deals are here for four days this year, but that doesn't mean all your favorite products will be on sale for that full length of time. Popular products tend to sell out quickly when the discounts are this deep, so if you've had your eye on something, you don't want to miss your chance to grab it on sale. Below, we tracked down some of the most beloved products that are on sale right now — and all of these have historically sold out quickly. If you spot something on this list that you've been waiting to add to your cart, wait no more. A deal this good may not come around again for a while. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. Stasher 10-piece reusable silicone storage bag set (40% off list price) Stasher's popular reusable storage bags can help you cut down on plastic waste (as well as the cost of buying single-use plastic bags), and we don't expect them to last long on the shelves. This 10-pack comes with bags in six different sizes, as well as four stretch lids. All are made with silicone and are safe for use in the dishwasher, freezer, microwave and oven. The TikTok-viral Meridian body hair trimmer (40% off list price) Rarely on sale for a price this low, this Meridian body hair trimmer is a viral product that may see a ton of orders this Prime Day (plenty of reviews mention first seeing it on TikTok). The trimmer can be used by both men and women, is 100% waterproof and promises a close shave without irritation, redness, ingrown hair, razor burn or bumps. It's cordless and rechargeable, and comes with an anti-nick guard to keep you safe. Cabeau TNE travel neck pillow (25% off list price) You might be familiar with Cabeau's popular neck pillows, and their TNE memory foam pillow will be on sale for Prime Day. Available in a bunch of different colors, this pillow is a must-have for flights, long train or car rides and more: It has seat straps you can attach to your chair to keep your head and neck in alignment, prevents your head from falling forward with ""head catch"" technology and is made with ergonomic memory foam. It also comes with a travel bag you can attach to your luggage. A bestselling absorbent and slip-resistant bath mat (50% off list price) An already affordable product just got an even better price. Gorilla Grip reports that their popular bath mat — which has 4.3 stars across more than 76,000 ratings — sold over 10,000 units in the past month alone, so with this half-off discount, we're expecting shoppers to flock here. Made with cozy, plush chenille, the absorbent bath mat has a textured rubber backing and is slip- and fade-resistant. It comes in so many sizes and colors, so you can match your bathroom's style and needs easily. Anua niacinamide 10 + TXA 4 serum (30% off list price) With the ongoing tariff situation potentially affecting the prices of Korean skin care and beauty products, as well as K-beauty's general popularity during Prime Day, we could see products like this Anua serum selling out. The brand reports that more than 40,000 units of the serum were bought in just the last month, too. Suitable for all skin types, the fragrance-free serum contains 10% niacinamide, as well as other skin-boosting ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramide to help your skin glow and provide hydration. The texture is described as lightweight and non-greasy, making this an easy add to any skin care routine. Lumineux teeth whitening strips (33% off list price) Yes, the ever-popular Crest 3D Whitestrips will be on sale for Prime Day (they appear elsewhere on this list), but we could also see this Lumineux alternative selling out too — it's garnered over 56,000 ratings with a 4.1-star average. These also come dentist-recommended for patients with sensitive teeth. The strips are enamel-safe and peroxide-free, relying on natural ingredients like coconut oil, lemon peel oil and more. Sol de Janeiro hair and body perfume mist (20% off list price) A constant Amazon beauty bestseller, we pretty much never see this Sol de Janeiro perfume mist on sale, so be prepared to grab it while you can. The mist comes in a ton of different scents, though the beachy, summer-ready Cheirosa '62 is probably the most well-known (it matches the viral Brazilian Bum Bum Cream scent, which also appears on this list). You can get a bottle in two sizes, including one that's travel-friendly. Blueair's newest air purifier (20% off list price) This Prime Day is the first time ever that Blueair's newest air purifier, the Blue Signature, is on sale, so you'll want to jump on this deal while you can. The purifier boasts seven stages of filtration, odor-blocking technology and an air quality indicator. You can control it using the accompanying app to set a schedule and get alerts for when the filter needs replacing. The purifier can clean up to 3,385 square feet and can even double as a table to make it multifunctional. Cocokind ceramide barrier serum (25% off list price) Another offering from a popular skin care brand, Cocokind's ceramide barrier serum can help soothe and hydrate the skin barrier using squalane and beta-glucan, as well as five ceramides. According to the brand, these ingredients can offer more hydration than hyaluronic acid, and with a comfortable, lightweight feel, the serum can layer with retinol, vitamin C and other skin care products and instantly absorb into the skin. HexClad 6-piece nonstick fry pan set (20% off list price) You're probably familiar with HexClad, the Gordon Ramsay-approved cookware brand. We could see this 6-piece set going quickly with the offered discount: It contains fry pans of three sizes (8-, 10- and 12-inch) as well as lids for each. The hexagonal nonstick surface provides an even sear and is easy to clean, not to mention dishwasher- and oven-safe up to 400 degrees....","The sales on these beloved products could be gone before Prime Day is even over.

But I purchased this for my little sister who is in nursing school, and she takes this thing with her everywhere!!! All she does is rave about how amazing it is! So I bought one as well, and they really are amazing products. Made super well, they keep ice in them for hours and hours! Super comfortable to hold in your hand, not too heavy or bulky. Easy to clean and seem to be super durable. I've dropped mine I don't even know how many times now, and not a single mark! They also don't leak easy at all.

We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. 40% off select colors of 40-ounce Stanley Quenchers (with select color 45% off with a lightning deal) — because if you're going to add to your collection or hop on the Emotional Support Water Bottle bandwagon, you might as well save a few bucks while you're at it. Promising review: ""I used to make fun of people for using these Stanley cups; I always thought they were overpriced and overhyped. But I purchased this for my little sister who is in nursing school, and she takes this thing with her everywhere!!! All she does is rave about how amazing it is! So I bought one as well, and they really are amazing products. Made super well, they keep ice in them for hours and hours! Super comfortable to hold in your hand, not too heavy or bulky. Easy to clean and seem to be super durable. I've dropped mine I don't even know how many times now, and not a single mark! They also don't leak easy at all. Unless you're holding it completely upside down, even then it doesn't leak fast. Super happy!"" —Jon & Katie Severs Price: $27 (originally $45) and shop all the Stanley deals here 2. 20% off Sol de Janeiro, including their Brazilian Bum Bum Cream (a deal worth replenishing for, because it *rarely* goes on sale). This is a cult-favorite body cream you're going to want to slather all over your body, thanks to the deep hydration (cupuaçu butter, coconut oil, and açai oil!) and temporary skin-tightening (caffeine!) it provides, plus a fragrance with notes of salted caramel and vanilla that reviewers L O V E. Caffeine has a number of skincare benefits, including brightening and temporarily reducing the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite, if that's something you're looking to do! You can read more about the skincare benefits of caffeine at the Cleveland Clinic. Promising review: ""OBSESSED. I can't say enough great things about this lotion. Don't hesitate, just buy"" —Summer Promising review: ""Where has this been all my life? I have been using this for maybe three days now, and putting it on in the morning and evening are the best parts of my day. The description of the scent as ""pistachio, salted caramel, and vanilla"" does not even begin to describe the incredibly decadent smell of this cream on my skin. My skin feels like velvet and I saw improvements in the texture after the first application. I will use it for the rest of my life. Do not ever discontinue this! I did not expect to be so amazed my this cream, but it is life-changing. Buy it! You won't regret it."" —Michelle Brown Price $38.40 (originally $44). They're offering 20% off their other creams and fragrances too! I'll be buying a second bottle of their Cheirosa '68 fragrance, which is veeeerrry similar to Baccarat Rouge 540! 3. 40% off (that's $100 off, an all-new lowest price ever!) the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro. With active noise cancellation, spatial audio, three silicone tips for customized fit, and over 24 hours of listening time with the included case, the AirPods Pro 2 give you a *ton* of bang for your buck....",2025-07-08 10:32:04,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The comment directly discusses Sol de Janeiro's Brazilian Bum Bum Cream, providing a detailed review of the product's scent, skincare benefits, and personal experience.

CeraVe Cerave Hydrating Cream to Foam Cleanser (Was $20) This cleanser is just what your skincare routine needs as a first step—it gently removes makeup and grime without drying out your skin.

mov_1143B5BDE1550C1E516D4F1F909C312F,"  Amazon Prime Day kicks off Tuesday, July 8, and what used to be a 24-hour shopping frenzy has now evolved into a nearly week-long sales event. However, this year, the real giant faces some economic headwinds. The Wall Street Journal reports that interest in Prime Day has waned in recent years, with year-over-year growth stuck in the single digits. Shoppers are also keeping a close eye on looming tariffs from the Trump administration, which could raise prices on everyday goods in the months ahead. What are customers buying? Analysts expect consumers to focus on deeper discounts now, especially on big-ticket items like TVs. Senior analyst Zam Stambor at eMarketer said customers are “very focused on getting value where and when they can right now.” One third-party seller told the Journal that while he expects strong momentum on Day 1, interest may taper off later in the week. Still, he believes sales will outpace a typical July day. BuzzFeed highlighted top deals on items such as Stanley Quenchers, Sol de Janeiro body cream, AirPods Pro, the Philips Sonicare toothbrush and the Nespresso Vertuo Plus coffee maker. Amazon leans on AI tools To boost the shopping experience, Amazon is promoting Rufus, its relatively new AI-powered product comparison tool available in the Amazon app. While it helps customers narrow down options, some users say it still struggles to interpret more complex questions. Amazon officials hope extending Prime Day will supercharge Amazon's revenues, which already bring in more than $50 billion annually. The sales event drives major ad spending from sellers looking to outshine competitors offering similar products. The CEO of Bartesian, a cocktail machine maker, says he will use Prime Day to build brand awareness ahead of the more competitive Black Friday season. He also warned that prices may rise later this year, depending on the impact of tariffs. Prime memberships and revenue expectations Amazon is also hoping to use the event to convert more shoppers into Prime members. Current membership costs $139 per year, which includes perks such as fast shipping and TV streaming offers. According to eMarketer, Amazon is projected to bring in a record $12.9 billion in the U.S. during Prime week — a jump of more than 50% compared to last year. This year's event follows spring campaigns like Pet Day, Book Day and the Summer Beauty Haul — all part of Amazon's effort to stretch its sales calendar year-round. Jason Morrell (Morning Managing Editor), Shianne DeLeon (Video Editor), and Devin Pavlou (Digital Producer) contributed to this report.","Amazon Prime Day kicks off Tuesday, July 8, and what used to be a 24-hour shopping frenzy has now evolved into a nearly week-long sales event.

Amazon leans on AI tools To boost the shopping experience, Amazon is promoting Rufus, its relatively new AI-powered product comparison tool available in the Amazon app. While it helps customers narrow down options, some users say it still struggles to interpret more complex questions. Amazon officials hope extending Prime Day will supercharge Amazon's revenues, which already bring in more than $50 billion annually. The sales event drives major ad spending from sellers looking to outshine competitors offering similar products. The CEO of Bartesian, a cocktail machine maker, says he will use Prime Day to build brand awareness ahead of the more competitive Black Friday season. He also warned that prices may rise later this year, depending on the impact of tariffs. Prime memberships and revenue expectations Amazon is also hoping to use the event to convert more shoppers into Prime members. Current membership costs $139 per year, which includes perks such as fast shipping and TV streaming offers. According to eMarketer, Amazon is projected to bring in a record $12.9 billion in the U.S. during Prime week — a jump of more than 50% compared to last year. This year's event follows spring campaigns like Pet Day, Book Day and the Summer Beauty Haul — all part of Amazon's effort to stretch its sales calendar year-round.

We got this because our baby is constantly on the floor, so we just wanted a little extra help with keeping the floors clean. We run it every night, and seeing how much it picks up blows our mind. We have two dogs, so dog hair and Cheerios are mainly what we get, but it has definitely made a difference with our floors on top of what we already do to keep our floors clean. Highly recommend. We have vinyl wood floors, so it runs fine on it, but it can go on carpet as well. We just leave the room doors closed because it is very loud when it runs and we don't want it to come into the rooms."" — Makayla Price: $139.99 (originally $274; also available in two other styles for a different or no discount) — and shop all the Roomba deals here 20% off Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream Caffeine has a number of skincare benefits, including brightening and temporarily reducing the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite, if that's something you're looking to do!

I have been using this for maybe three days now, and putting it on in the morning and evening are the best parts of my day. The description of the scent as ""pistachio, salted caramel, and vanilla"" does not even begin to describe the incredibly decadent smell of this cream on my skin. My skin feels like velvet and I saw improvements in the texture after the first application. I will use it for the rest of my life. Do not ever discontinue this!

The scent of summer has found its way into Amazon's biggest sale of the year, and beauty lovers everywhere are buzzing. Sol de Janeiro's Brazilian Bum Bum Cream Set is one of the most talked-about Prime Day steals — and for good reason. For 20% off during Amazon Prime Day, this cult-favorite body care bundle is being scooped up by fans and first-time buyers alike (as it should be). It's not your typical moisturizer, either. It's a full-blown trip to your piña-colada-sipping tropical resort. In short, it's an experience, wrapped in a golden jar and sealed with buttery bliss. For those unfamiliar with the phenomenon, Brazilian Bum Bum Cream is a rich, fast-absorbing body moisturizer powered by guaraná extract — an Amazonian plant packed with caffeine. After reviewing practically the entire brand, I can attest that this holy-grail item is worth the hype. The formula also features cupuaçu butter and coconut oil, ingredients known for their skin-softening properties. But beyond the hydration benefits, it's the fragrance that turns first-time users into lifelong devotees: warm pistachio, salted caramel and vanilla notes linger on the skin for hours, making it as much a perfume as a lotion. Prime Day kicked off on July 8 and lasts until July 11, and this set is definitely one of the best Prime Day beauty deals offered right now. The celebrity seal of approval has only fueled the frenzy. Blake Lively, Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber are among the high-profile names who've made this cream a mainstay in their skincare routines. The set being offered on Amazon includes not only the standard-size cream but also travel-friendly companions that enhance the fragrance and hydration experience. So yes, I'll be shopping this two-piece set and be taking the graceful mini on my Hawaiian honeymoon this September. Layering the cream with its matching body mist or shower gel intensifies the signature Cheirosa '62 scent and makes the daily routine feel like a spa-worthy escape. If you love indulgent scents, smooth skin, and that golden-hour glow, this is your moment. While it's 20% off, I can say with full certainty that this twin pack is the most dynamic duo Prime Day has to offer. Use promo code NYPOSTAB10 to save 10% on top of Prime Day deals.

You work hard, so you deserve nice things. And if you don't work hard, well, who am I to judge? Everyone's earned a lil' treat, in my humble opinion. Whether it's a completely unnecessary bottle of hand sanitizer you impulse-buy at checkout (despite having a personal stockpile rattling around in your bag) or a quick online shopping break during work hours just to feel something, I fully support it. A “lil' treat” can be anything, really. It's how we cope in the modern world (have you seen the news?) . And right now, thanks to Amazon's Prime Day Sale, you can snag some delightfully unnecessary-but-deeply-satisfying goodies for $50 or less. SOL DE JANEIRO Rio Trio Body Cream Set $26.60 $38.00 30% off Buy Now On Amazon We're talking about the viral Jisulife handheld mini fan that might literally save you from melting this summer, or the iconic Stanley tumbler that everyone seems to have. There's also the Sol de Janeiro hair mist and body spray, which smells like a beach vacation, and a silky Kitsch satin pillowcase that promises to help protect your hair — all discounted and mostly priced between $10 and $30.

mov_C7ECB907BF771B5C5EB700DA7E5A4F9C,"  The Independent's journalism is supported by our readers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn commission. Why trust us? These are the best deals in the summer sales We're almost reaching the end of Amazon Prime Day, with the deals set to wrap up tomorrow (11 July) at midnight. In a bid to compete with the online giant, many retailers have launched their own sales with reductions that match or even beat Amazon's sale. From Currys and John Lewis to Boots and Lakeland, there are plenty of big-name retailers offering deals right now. If you're not a Prime member or want to snap up some offers this weekend, once the sale has ended, you can use this page as your ultimate guide to the best summer sales. Plus, unlike with Prime Day, you don't have to be a member to shop these sales. If none of Amazon's Prime Day discounts grab your attention, or an item on your wishlist hasn't been included in the sale, you can check this page for the latest deals on our tried-and-tested favourites from rival retailers. Currys has slashed the price of thousands of its appliances and electricals, with savings on Shark, Samsung, Dyson and more. In most cases, competing retailers are price-matching Currys, but if you notice popular products dropping out of stock in other summer sales, head to Currys to check if it has them in stock. These are some of the best deals in the Currys sale: Shark FlexBreeze HydroGo misting fan: Was £129.99, now £99.99, Currys.co.uk Breville one-touch coffeehouse coffee machine: Was £349.99, now £169.99, Currys.co.uk Shark flexbreeze hydrogo misting fan: Was £129.99, now £99.99, Currys.co.uk Much like Amazon, Currys slashed the price of this portable Shark fan to £99 back in June, just in time for the arrival of an early summer heatwave. The original FlexBreeze was named best cordless fan, and this version emits a fine mist thanks to a 150ml water tank. Our reviewer wrote that the original FlexBreeze did a “great job of cooling the air to each side of the unit as well as directly in front of it”, so you can expect the same cooling relief from this tabletop model.

mov_E9341563588A2F77AF5CA430D6A324C5,"  Depending on how similar the items are, and the rights a company holds, dupes may or may not cross legal lines To customers, a lookalike to Ugg's Tasman slippers or a knock-off of Lululemon's ultra-popular Define jacket can be a fantastic bargain. But to the companies that make the original products, similar-but-cheaper items can be bad for business. While knock-offs are nothing new, dupes — short for ""duplicate"" — have exploded in popularity in recent years. And for many younger buyers, buying an imitation is no longer something to hide. ""A lot of the consumers that we're seeing on social media, on TikTok, are so proudly displaying the dupes that they found, kind of as a badge of honour. That stigma really isn't there anymore,"" said Julie Zerbo, editor-in-chief of fashion publication The Fashion Law. The rise of dupes has also brought a corresponding wave of lawsuits from companies, saying copies of their products shouldn't be allowed to exist. American Eagle, Sol de Janeiro, Benefit Cosmetics, Deckers Brands (Ugg's parent company) and Supergoop are just a few of the fashion and beauty companies on that list. Vancouver-based Lululemon became a recent entrant when it sued Costco late last month over three products it said were knock-offs of its clothing. But are they actually illegal? Intellectual property experts say it really depends on the rights a company has over a product, and whether customers can tell the difference between the original and its copycat. When do dupes cross the line? The term ""dupe"" itself has been appearing more in legal filings, says Alexandra Roberts, law and media professor at Northeastern University — including in Lululemon's against Costco. That could partially be because their appeal has grown among online shoppers. ""Where in previous years, a company might have just said, 'Oh, this looks to us like trademark infringement,' here, [brands] are kind of building a case around the idea of [a] dupe,"" Roberts said. ""The fact that something is perceived as a dupe ... that all works its way into the allegations."" WATCH | Trying to beat online fashion copies: Trying to beat online fashion copies 8 months agoDuration 2:25 Loren Mallett, an intellectual property lawyer in Vancouver, says any case where a company says it's been copied largely depends on the rights it has over its product. Patents, industrial designs and trademarks can all protect certain parts of an item — but a company has to formally register elements like its logo or packaging design. If it hasn't, it's probably out of luck, Mallett says. And even if it has, it still might be OK to sell something really similar. The legality of a dupe depends on whether customers could be confused by the two items and think they are the exact same, Roberts says. In Lululemon's case, for example, the question might be whether buyers of the Costco sweatshirt thought they were purchasing Lululemon's Scuba hoodie, Roberts says. She says people tend to like dupes specifically because they aren't the real deal, but a cheaper alternative. And for that reason, she says, many may not be successfully litigated against. LISTEN | Dupe culture: Why Gen Z is embracing fakes: While we don't necessarily think of them as dupes, generic brands — think Life brand products sold at Shoppers Drug Mart, or Walmart's Great Value — have occupied this space for a long time, Roberts says. And historically, courts have allowed them because customers understand that one is meant to be a cheaper alternative to the other. Mallett adds that the conversation around dupes could impact companies like Lululemon in court, as many customers have said online that some of Costco's products look just like Lululemon's. The athleisure company will likely argue this as evidence that Costco wanted to pass off its product as a Lululemon item — whereas Costco will likely say it is proof the customer knew for a fact they were buying a similar-looking alternative at a lower price, according to Mallett. A case study Zerbo says many dupe-related cases are still making their way through courts. But there are some resolved ones where the lookalike has come out on top. She points to a recent conflict in the U.S. between Steve Madden and Ganni as a good example. Danish footwear brand Ganni sent cease-and-desist letters to some companies that sold certain Steve Madden shoes, saying they looked too similar to its own buckle ballerina flats and two-strap sandals. But Steve Madden turned around and sued Ganni, saying it had no right to tell those retailers they couldn't sell the similar Steve Madden shoes, because there was ""nothing new or original"" about a shoe made of leather and that has straps, eyelets and buckles — common elements in lots of footwear. Ganni ultimately walked back its original legal threats, Zerbo said, and even agreed not to sue in the future over the shoe designs. (Ganni was more successful in its home country of Denmark, however.) Zerbo says these cases show how courts generally don't want monopolies, and try to prevent giving a brand that kind of power. ""That would be bad for competition, that would be bad for consumers, prices would go through the roof."" What does that mean for my dupes? Zerbo says duping is unlikely to slow down anytime soon, as many shoppers love a good deal. She says history is full of copycat designs, which have largely been allowed to exist. Take fast fashion, for example. Companies like H&M and Forever 21 became giants mainly by replicating runway elements for a cheaper price. ""It's such a big market. There's so much consumer demand for dupes that companies would be hard pressed to stop trying to make them.""...","Depending on how similar the items are, and the rights a company holds, dupes may or may not cross legal lines To customers, a lookalike to Ugg's Tasman slippers or a knock-off of Lululemon's ultra-popular Define jacket can be a fantastic bargain.

This set costs around the same but includes a moisturiser and eye cream, so you're really getting your money's worth. The advanced night repair serum made it into our round-up of the best anti-ageing serums. Beauty journalist, Jane Druker, says that it “helps to visibly soften, smooth and plump” thanks to the addition of skin-quenching hyaluronic acid. Ninja dual zone air fryer: Was £229.99, now £151.05, The Ninja dual zone air fryer has been a popular buy this Amazon Prime Day, and now John Lewis has matched the online retailer's price. This gives you more options to save if you notice it dropping out of stock at either store. Our reviewer was impressed with the variety of settings on this two-drawer air fryer and said “that it takes much of the guesswork out of timing and temperature, making mealtime feel less like a chore”. Boots: up to 60 per cent off, Boots has launched its summer sale with thousands of offers on beauty electricals, skincare, haircare and more. You've got five more days to shop the sale, so there'll be plenty of discounts to snap up once Amazon Prime Day is done and dusted. These are the best Boots deals now: Philips lumea 8000 series: Was £509.99, now £349.99, Boots.comShark cryoglow under eye cooling and LED face mask: Was £299.99, now £265, Boots.comSol de Janeiro limited edition cheirosa hair & body perfume mist set: Was £38, now £26.60, Boots.com Philips lumea 8000 series: Was £509.99, now £349.99, Philips' lumea IPL range is one of our favourites for hair removal, so we're pleased to see the price of older models, such as the lumea 8000, slowly going down in price. Beauty editor Lucy Partington was impressed with the results after using this IPL machine, with “hair becoming sparser after just four treatments”. Right now, there's £160 off at Boots in its super savings week sale. Shark cryoglow under eye cooling and LED face mask: Was £299.99, now £265, Boots is one of the many retailers that have reduced the price of the viral Shark LED face mask. Amazon still has the best offer, but if you're not a Prime member or you've got advantage card points to spend, you can save with this offer. Senior shopping writer Daisy Lester was left “seriously impressed” after testing the Shark cryoglow mask for eight weeks. Its 'blemish repair' mode was her favourite setting, leaving her skin's texture and appearance “significantly improved”. Sol de Janeiro limited edition cheirosa hair & body perfume mist set: Was £38, now £26.60, Here's the perfect chance to sample Sol de Janeiro's popular perfume mists, with four bottles of its much-loved scents for £26.60, working out at £6.65 per 30ml bottle. The set includes Brazilian crush, which is a personal favourite with notes of salted caramel and pistachio, as well as delícia drench, which beauty writer Lauren Cunningham says smells like “holiday in a bottle”. Lakeland: up to 50 per cent off, If you want to upgrade your al fresco dining set-up, Lakeland has some great offers on outdoor cooking appliances and fun summer buys, such as ice cream makers. Here are some of our favourite deals in the Lakeland sale:...","We're almost reaching the end of Amazon Prime Day, with the deals set to wrap up tomorrow (11 July) at midnight. In a bid to compete with the online giant, many retailers have launched their own sales with reductions that match or even beat Amazon's sale. From Currys and John Lewis to Boots and Lakeland, there are plenty of big-name retailers offering deals right now. If you're not a Prime member or want to snap up some offers this weekend, once the sale has ended, you can use this page as your ultimate guide to the best summer sales. Plus, unlike with Prime Day, you don't have to be a member to shop these sales. If none of Amazon's Prime Day discounts grab your attention, or an item on your wishlist hasn't been included in the sale, you can check this page for the latest deals on our tried-and-tested favourites from rival retailers. Currys: up to 30 per cent off, Currys has slashed the price of thousands of its appliances and electricals, with savings on Shark, Samsung, Dyson and more. In most cases, competing retailers are price-matching Currys, but if you notice popular products dropping out of stock in other summer sales, head to Currys to check if it has them in stock. These are some of the best deals in the Currys sale: Shark FlexBreeze HydroGo misting fan: Was £129.99, now £99.99, Currys.co.ukBreville one-touch coffeehouse coffee machine: Was £349.99, now £169.99, Currys.co.uk Shark flexbreeze hydrogo misting fan: Was £129.99, now £99.99, Much like Amazon, Currys slashed the price of this portable Shark fan to £99 back in June, just in time for the arrival of an early summer heatwave. The original FlexBreeze was named best cordless fan, and this version emits a fine mist thanks to a 150ml water tank. Our reviewer wrote that the original FlexBreeze did a “great job of cooling the air to each side of the unit as well as directly in front of it”, so you can expect the same cooling relief from this tabletop model. Stock is sparse on Amazon, so it's worth checking Currys if the colour that you want isn't available. Breville one-touch coffeehouse coffee machine: Was £349.99, now £169.99, If your morning coffee is an oat flat white, you'll want to take a look at this deal on our best coffee machine for vegan milks. Our appliances expert, Zoe Phillimore, praised this feature and said, “You can tweak how much foam and steamed milk is added to your coffee”. Plus, you can store the detachable milk container in the fridge to keep it cool. Right now at Currys, there's a chunky £180 off. John Lewis: up to 50 per cent off, John Lewis often price matches Amazon's Prime Day deals, so it's worth checking out its offering to see if you can get a longer warranty or free delivery. These are some of the best deals in the John Lewis sale: Dyson supersonic straight and wavy hair dryer: Was £329.99, now £279.99, Johnlewis.comEstee Lauder advanced night repair skincare gift set: Was £69, now £48, Johnlewis.comNinja dual zone air fryer: Was £229.99, now £151.05, Johnlewis.com Dyson supersonic straight and wavy hair dryer: Was £329.99, now £279.99, I've spotted a few of our IndyBest favourites from Dyson in the Prime Day sale, including £80 off the airwrap. You won't find the supersonic hair dryer in Amazon's deals, but you can save £50 when you buy it from John Lewis. This model doesn't come with the full range of attachments, but there is a concentrator nozzle and flyaway attachment included. We've reviewed various iterations of the supersonic hair dryer over the years, including the supersonic nural and supersonic r, and they always receive rave reviews from our testers.

The 'Instant Face Lift' cream for smoothing mature skin (44% off) We write quite a bit about mature skincare here at HuffPost, so when we spot a highly-rated firming lotion that's new to us and at a great price, we have to share. Enter: this “Instant Facelift” cream made with retinol, collagen and hyaluronic acid. From the brand Snfajohe, it's currently 44% off. Reviewers say it's a fast-absorbing, lightweight formula that brings fairly quick tightening and glowing results. Celebrated for not being greasy or sticky, the cream helps make skin softer and smoother. Reviewers are literally singing this formula's praises. “From the first application, I noticed my skin looking firmer and more hydrated,” one review wrote. ” ...I've tried many anti-aging creams, but this one truly stands out. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a real difference in their skincare routine!” A sporty-cool polo shirt for beating sunshine, heat and sweat (up to 57% off list price) Freshly marked down up to 57% off (depending on color and size, of course), this Adidas polo shirt is the ultimate summer-ready top. For one, it sports (heh) the brand's Climacool technology, which claims to keep you dry and cool in hot weather. This top is meant for tennis, so it has split seams for extra mobility and ventilated fabric that also wicks moisture, but who says you can't wear it on a casual weekend out? Grab it in men's sizes XS-XXL in one of four colors. The Pink Stuff bundle (15% off) The Pink Stuff is a longtime fan favorite around here for it's ability to clean seemingly anything. This six-piece bundle gives you the classic paste, a multi-purpose spray, a bathroom foam spray and three sponges. Promising review: ""Love it !!!! My stove is so clean from the paste. Smells good.

This 180-chew jar is loaded with colostrum, licorice and ginger root and omega 3 to relieve seasonal allergies and beautify that skin and coat.

July 15, 2025, 1:05am Macy's may be holding on to its longtime position as the top U.S. retailer by share of fragrance sales, but plenty of other shifts are afoot when it comes to who's winning the category. According to YipitData, Macy's accounted for 31.8 percent of fragrance sales during the month of May, indicating a 14.7-point lead from the category's next-biggest retailer during the period, Ulta Beauty. While significant, that lead is several points less than it was, say, two years prior in 2023, when Macy's accounted for more than 40 percent of fragrance sales during the same month. This shift is in part due to the nascent growth of alternative fragrance retailers as formidable competitors in the space. There's Amazon, which, per YipitData, accounted for 14.9 percent of fragrance sales in May across the platform's first- and third-party sellers (tracking after Sephora, which accounted for 15.5 percent during the same period). TikTok Shop, too, wasn't on the map at all in the U.S. until halfway through 2023, yet today the e-tailer — which has propelled brands from Lattafa to Phlur to virality — goes head-to-head with Target in terms of share of fragrance sales, actually outpacing Target slightly in May. Year-to-date, the top three fragrance brands at Sephora have been Kayali, Sol de Janeiro and YSL Beauty, in that order. For the month of May, Valentino overtook YSL for the number-three spot, while in April, Chanel's Chance Eau Splendide Eau de Parfum was the retailer's top-selling new stock keeping unit across the store. On Amazon, which YipitData reports has gained modest but steady share in fragrance since 2023, winning brands range from value-driven to designer, a dynamic which the platform's top two brands in May — Lattafa and Versace — quintessentially represent. Other top 10 brands on Amazon include Sol de Janeiro, Nautica and Dior (which, like all brands owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, does not officially sell on the platform). So far in 2025, fragrance has been the fastest-growing category in beauty, as has been the case since 2021.

mov_73E4ED1F1427B944611E55FC53EC0880,"  The beauty and personal care landscape continues to grow increasingly competitive in the advent of increased social selling, pushing industry stakeholders to pivot into increasingly creative, innovative efforts to reinvent category offerings. According to the recently released the new report by consumer insight firm NIQ, these efforts are paying dividends: e-commerce drove a 17.4% increase in beauty and health sales in 2024, with online now representing 42% of total category revenue. E-commerce, social selling, and the largest swing in category growth Among the trends tracked in NIQ's report, social media, wellness, personalization, and luxury, social media was highlighted as the most transformative force. “It's not just about visibility; TikTok is becoming a commerce channel itself,” said Anna Mayo, Vice President, Beauty Vertical at NIQ. Through “social selling (especially on TikTok Shop), rapid digital discovery, and retail consolidation around platforms like Amazon,” she told CosmeticsDesign USA, the beauty category has particularly benefited from the growing influence of impulse-driven purchases. As noted in NIQ's report, 68% of social buys are unplanned, with user-generated content as a main driver behind the conversion momentum. Leading beauty brands in this space, Mayo advised, are leveraging building blocks like “experiential digital storytelling, social-first product launches and agile fulfillment across platforms.” For example, brands such as e.l.f., Phlur, and Dove are developing launch strategies specifically tailored for social platforms. “This forces manufacturers to prioritize agility, trend responsiveness, and creator partnerships in product development and marketing,” she said. High-growth segments signal new consumer priorities The fragrance category was a notable outlier, according to the report, with a 20% year-over-year growth rate that was largely driven by viral trends and evolving consumer behavior, especially among Gen Z. For example, Mayo illustrated, “instead of having a signature scent, they are investing in a fragrance wardrobe, with scents for different moods and occasions, that can also be layered together.” Brands that are attuned to the demographic and behavioral shifts like this have responded by expanding hero fragrances into new product formats, such as body care, and intensifying social media campaigns. “With fragrance's emotional and identity-driven appeal, as well as its continued innovation in formats and storytelling, the category is well-positioned for continued growth,” she added. Several other emerging and previously underperforming segments also outpaced expectations in 2024. “Categories like first aid, lip care, and men's body care stood out with high-growth product launches,” she said. Products like Dr. Squatch lip balm and Band-Aid Pro Heal Bandages, for example, reflected a growing demand for “wellness-adjacent personal care” and innovation in functional and inclusive product design. Strategic innovation imperative for 2025 and beyond The impact of brand innovation, which the report noted contributed to nine percent of mass retail beauty sales, cannot be understated, said Mayo. Citing examples like Sol de Janeiro's Rio Deo and SheaMoisture's Even Tone Deodorant as evidence that consumers respond positively to new offerings from trusted brands, the data demonstrated that line extensions have been a successful endeavor for some beauty brands over the past year. “These cases show that consumers gravitate toward familiar, trusted brands offering new formats that match their values, whether that's wellness, inclusivity or luxury feel at mass price points,” she explained. However, she cautioned, while innovation is “a critical driver of brand growth, especially in times of economic uncertainty...the data shows that while line extensions dominate, not all innovation leads to incremental growth, so brands must be diligent in assessing whether new products are additive or potentially cannibalizing existing sales.” Ultimately, she concluded, “success will depend on staying agile, insight-driven, and culturally relevant, developing products that not only meet functional needs but also tap into emerging values and behaviors shaping the future of health and beauty.”","The beauty and personal care landscape continues to grow increasingly competitive in the advent of increased social selling, pushing industry stakeholders to pivot into increasingly creative, innovative efforts to reinvent category offerings.

For example, Mayo illustrated, “instead of having a signature scent, they are investing in a fragrance wardrobe, with scents for different moods and occasions, that can also be layered together.” Brands that are attuned to the demographic and behavioral shifts like this have responded by expanding hero fragrances into new product formats, such as body care, and intensifying social media campaigns. “With fragrance's emotional and identity-driven appeal, as well as its continued innovation in formats and storytelling, the category is well-positioned for continued growth,” she added. Several other emerging and previously underperforming segments also outpaced expectations in 2024. “Categories like first aid, lip care, and men's body care stood out with high-growth product launches,” she said. Products like Dr. Squatch lip balm and Band-Aid Pro Heal Bandages, for example, reflected a growing demand for “wellness-adjacent personal care” and innovation in functional and inclusive product design. Strategic innovation imperative for 2025 and beyond The impact of brand innovation, which the report noted contributed to nine percent of mass retail beauty sales, cannot be understated, said Mayo. Citing examples like Sol de Janeiro's Rio Deo and SheaMoisture's Even Tone Deodorant as evidence that consumers respond positively to new offerings from trusted brands, the data demonstrated that line extensions have been a successful endeavor for some beauty brands over the past year. “These cases show that consumers gravitate toward familiar, trusted brands offering new formats that match their values, whether that's wellness, inclusivity or luxury feel at mass price points,” she explained. However, she cautioned, while innovation is “a critical driver of brand growth, especially in times of economic uncertainty...the data shows that while line extensions dominate, not all innovation leads to incremental growth, so brands must be diligent in assessing whether new products are additive or potentially cannibalizing existing sales.” Ultimately, she concluded, “success will depend on staying agile, insight-driven, and culturally relevant, developing products that not only meet functional needs but also tap into emerging values and behaviors shaping the future of health and beauty.”",2025-07-15 14:21:46,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The comment directly mentions Sol de Janeiro in the context of brand innovation, specifically highlighting their Rio Deo product as an example of successful line extension and consumer-responsive product development.

Even right out of the package, it wasn't very wrinkled. The material wasn't too thick or thin. I wore it in summer with sandals, but I think you could easily add a sweater/tights/boots for a cute fall look. It was easy to get on/off in the bathroom (one small button at the back of the neck)... And, best of all, it has pockets!!!"" —Jessica K. Price: $23.99+ (available in women's sizes S–XL and 17 colors) 2. A set of golden bracelets that just gives ""I know what a 401K is.""

Promising review: ""I absolutely love this bracelet set! The pieces are delicate yet sturdy, and they can be worn together or separately for different looks. The design is simple but elegant, making it perfect for both casual and formal occasions. They're also really comfortable to wear all day. Definitely worth the price!"" —Brandy Gay Price: $18.99 for a set of three (also available in sets of two) 3. Nyx's Lip IV Hydrating Gloss Serum because anyone who's ever lived somewhere humid has wished that their cute, daily lip color could also moisturize and hydrate their chapped lips, which this baby does for up to 12 hours! Promising review: ""I normally don't love lip products. I have small lips and I am never really satisfied! But this stuff is sooooo good! You don't even understand how moisturizing and glossy this is. It's not sticky, very pigmented, and the stain it leaves behind is gorgeous! I got the Rosie one, and it's chef's kiss perfect! I'm totally getting more!"" —Katherine Stanton Price: $11.97 (available in 12 shades) 4. Sol de Janeiro's Hair and Body Fragrance Mist with notes of pistachio, salted caramel, and vanilla so you can smell like a walking, talking tropical vacation everywhere you go, without the need to overspend on an expensive bottle of perfume from your local Macy's. If you're in love with the smell of the cult-favorite Bum Bum Cream, this will have you smelling like it all day long. Promising review: ""The hype off TikTok is real about this scent. It's very warm and vanilla-smelling. Almost like a beachy vibe. I hate how no one would give me any kind of explanation on how it smelled, but glad I jumped on the bandwagon with this one."" —Karli Bullins Get it from Amazon for $25 (available in 11 other scents). 5.
