Still, that doesn't mean they're not a good supplementary treatment to have in your skincare regimen, especially if you have chronically dry, dehydrated skin. Since toners are an optional step, if you do choose to use a toner, it should at least check off a few boxes, but one, in particular, is of the most importance: hydration. But what is a toner, anyway? “A toner is a solution that typically contains actives and is designed to be used after cleansing and before moisturizing. Toners can balance pH, remove impurities, exfoliate, and hydrate. They are not necessary, but they can provide great benefits,” says Dr. Blair Murphy-Rose, a board-certified dermatologist at Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York and clinical instructor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. For those with dry skin, “the benefits of a toner depend on the specific formulation and the ingredients it contains. Many toners contain exfoliating actives that help to improve tone and texture, reduce dullness, diminish hyperpigmentation, and bring a glow to the skin,” she adds. Toners made specifically for dry skin can “hydrate, balance pH, and remove residual oils.” Best Calming Toner ANUA Heartleaf 77 Soothing Toner Read more Best Toner for Beginners CeraVe Hydrating Toner Read more Best for Gentle Exfoliation Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant Read more While your TikTok and Instagram bookmark tab is likely chock-full of toners on your wishlist, we did the hard work for you by combing through dozens of online customer reviews and our personal stash to find the 12 best toners for dry skin.

But what is a toner, anyway? “A toner is a solution that typically contains actives and is designed to be used after cleansing and before moisturizing. Toners can balance pH, remove impurities, exfoliate, and hydrate. They are not necessary, but they can provide great benefits,” says Dr. Blair Murphy-Rose, a board-certified dermatologist at Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York and clinical instructor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. For those with dry skin, “the benefits of a toner depend on the specific formulation and the ingredients it contains. Many toners contain exfoliating actives that help to improve tone and texture, reduce dullness, diminish hyperpigmentation, and bring a glow to the skin,” she adds. Toners made specifically for dry skin can “hydrate, balance pH, and remove residual oils.” Best Calming Toner ANUA Heartleaf 77 Soothing Toner Read more Best Toner for Beginners CeraVe Hydrating Toner Read more Best for Gentle Exfoliation Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant Read more While your TikTok and Instagram bookmark tab is likely chock-full of toners on your wishlist, we did the hard work for you by combing through dozens of online customer reviews and our personal stash to find the 12 best toners for dry skin.

신 대표 ""FBA, 단순 물류 옵션 넘어 브랜드 신뢰·판매력 높이는 전략""
""日진출 희망하는 국내 셀러들에게 현지 맞춤형 가이드라인 제공""
[도쿄=뉴시스]전병훈 기자 = ""FBA(Fulfillment By Amazon)는 단순한 물류 옵션이 아니라 브랜드의 신뢰와 판매력을 높이는 핵심 전략입니다.""
신화숙 아마존 글로벌셀링 코리아 대표는 ""국내 셀러들이 아마존 재팬을 통해 일본 시장에 효과적으로 진출할 수 있도록 입점부터 배송, 고객 경험 확대, 마케팅까지 전 과정에서 장기적 성장을 돕는 브랜드 육성형 전략을 지원하고 있다""고 강조했다.
지난달 30일(현지시각) 일본 도쿄에서 열린 기자 간담회에서다.
최근 K뷰티가 일본 시장에서 눈에 띄는 성과를 거두면서 아마존 글로벌셀링 코리아는 건강기능식품·식품·패션 등으로 한국 브랜드의 진출 영역을 넓히고 있다.
현재는 K뷰티 전용 큐레이션 스토어가 아마존 재팬 내에 운영 중이며, 내년에는 K건기식 전용 스토어 페이지 개설도 검토 중이다.
""물류·운영 부담 줄이고 제품 개발·마케팅 집중""…FBA 효과
아마존 글로벌셀링 코리아가 국내 셀러들에게 제공하는 가장 큰 강점은 아마존 재팬의 물류 시스템인 FBA를 활용해 브랜드 경쟁력을 높일 수 있다는 것이다.
신 대표는 ""셀러가 FBA를 이용하면 일본 내 주문 처리와 고객 응대, 배송 등 운영 전반을 아마존 재팬이 전담한다""며 ""이 덕분에 셀러는 물류나 운영에 대한 부담에서 벗어나 브랜드 마케팅과 제품 개발에 더욱 집중할 수 있다""고 강조했다.
그는 이어 ""FBA는 규모의 경제와 사업 연속성을 동시에 확보할 수 있는 전략적 선택""이라며 ""대형 브랜드뿐 아니라 소규모 셀러들도 아마존 재팬의 글로벌 물류 인프라를 활용해 일본을 포함한 글로벌 시장으로 진출할 수 있다""고 덧붙였다.
일본 고객 특성 반영한 맞춤형 진출 전략 제공
아마존 글로벌셀링 코리아는 일본 시장 진출을 희망하는 국내 셀러들에게 일본 고객 특유의 소비 습관을 반영한 맞춤형 가이드라인도 제공하고 있다.
신 대표는 ""일본 소비자는 리뷰, 상품 상세페이지, 제품 성분 등을 매우 꼼꼼히 비교하는 성향이 있다""며 ""이를 전략적으로 활용해 상세 페이지 구성과 리뷰 관리를 철저히 하면 일본 시장에서의 구매 전환율을 높일 수 있다""고 설명했다.
특히 일본 시장에서 두각을 나타낸 한국 브랜드 사례로 ▲'모공 케어'라는 명확한 키워드를 통해 빠르게 시장을 공략한 넘버즈인(numbuzin) ▲민감성 피부 고객을 위한 리뷰 중심 콘텐츠 전략을 활용한 아누아(Anua) ▲합리적인 가격과 뛰어난 품질로 일본 소비자의 재구매를 이끌어낸 VT 시카 마스크 등을 소개했다.
K뷰티 매출 두 배 성장…""온·오프라인 전략 통했다""
올해 아마존 재팬에 입점한 국내 셀러의 전체 매출은 전년 대비 두 자릿수 성장했고, 특히 K뷰티 카테고리는 약 두 배 가까이 증가했다.
신 대표는 ""K뷰티가 일본 내에서 급성장한 배경에는 오프라인 체험 마케팅과 이를 연계한 온라인 구매 유도 전략이 주효했다""고 밝혔다.
그는 ""일본 시부야에서 진행된 체험형 오프라인 이벤트를 통해 10개 이상의 한국 브랜드가 현지 소비자와 직접 만났고, 이는 자연스럽게 아마존 재팬의 K뷰티 전용 온라인 페이지로 연결돼 실제 구매로 이어졌다""며 ""이 같은 온·오프라인 통합 마케팅 모델은 현재 미국 등 타 국가에서도 성공 사례로 벤치마킹되고 있다""고 덧붙였다.

◎공감언론 뉴시스 [email protected]","SPR_COMBO[ko]일본 도쿄 현지서 신화숙 아마존 글로벌셀링 코리아 대표 인터뷰 신 대표 ""FBA, 단순 물류 옵션 넘어 브랜드 신뢰·판매력 높이는 전략"" ""日진출 희망하는 국내 셀러들에게 현지 맞춤형 가이드라인 제공"" [도쿄=뉴시스]전병훈 기자 = ""FBA(Fulfillment By Amazon)는 단순한 물류 옵션이 아니라 브랜드의 신뢰와 판매력을 높이는 핵심 전략입니다."" 신화숙 아마존 글로벌셀링 코리아 대표는 ""국내 셀러들이 아마존 재팬을 통해 일본 시장에 효과적으로 진출할 수 있도록 입점부터 배송, 고객 경험 확대, 마케팅까지 전 과정에서 장기적 성장을 돕는 브랜드 육성형 전략을 지원하고 있다""고 강조했다. 지난달 30일(현지시각) 일본 도쿄에서 열린 기자 간담회에서다. 최근 K뷰티가 일본 시장에서 눈에 띄는 성과를 거두면서 아마존 글로벌셀링 코리아는 건강기능식품·식품·패션 등으로 한국 브랜드의 진출 영역을 넓히고 있다. 현재는 K뷰티 전용 큐레이션 스토어가 아마존 재팬 내에 운영 중이며, 내년에는 K건기식 전용 스토어 페이지 개설도 검토 중이다. ""물류·운영 부담 줄이고 제품 개발·마케팅 집중""…FBA 효과 아마존 글로벌셀링 코리아가 국내 셀러들에게 제공하는 가장 큰 강점은 아마존 재팬의 물류 시스템인 FBA를 활용해 브랜드 경쟁력을 높일 수 있다는 것이다. 신 대표는 ""셀러가 FBA를 이용하면 일본 내 주문 처리와 고객 응대, 배송 등 운영 전반을 아마존 재팬이 전담한다""며 ""이 덕분에 셀러는 물류나 운영에 대한 부담에서 벗어나 브랜드 마케팅과 제품 개발에 더욱 집중할 수 있다""고 강조했다. 그는 이어 ""FBA는 규모의 경제와 사업 연속성을 동시에 확보할 수 있는 전략적 선택""이라며 ""대형 브랜드뿐 아니라 소규모 셀러들도 아마존 재팬의 글로벌 물류 인프라를 활용해 일본을 포함한 글로벌 시장으로 진출할 수 있다""고 덧붙였다. 일본 고객 특성 반영한 맞춤형 진출 전략 제공 아마존 글로벌셀링 코리아는 일본 시장 진출을 희망하는 국내 셀러들에게 일본 고객 특유의 소비 습관을 반영한 맞춤형 가이드라인도 제공하고 있다. 신 대표는 ""일본 소비자는 리뷰, 상품 상세페이지, 제품 성분 등을 매우 꼼꼼히 비교하는 성향이 있다""며 ""이를 전략적으로 활용해 상세 페이지 구성과 리뷰 관리를 철저히 하면 일본 시장에서의 구매 전환율을 높일 수 있다""고 설명했다. 특히 일본 시장에서 두각을 나타낸 한국 브랜드 사례로 ▲'모공 케어'라는 명확한 키워드를 통해 빠르게 시장을 공략한 넘버즈인(numbuzin) ▲민감성 피부 고객을 위한 리뷰 중심 콘텐츠 전략을 활용한 아누아(Anua) ▲합리적인 가격과 뛰어난 품질로 일본 소비자의 재구매를 이끌어낸 VT 시카 마스크 등을 소개했다. K뷰티 매출 두 배 성장…""온·오프라인 전략 통했다"" 올해 아마존 재팬에 입점한 국내 셀러의 전체 매출은 전년 대비 두 자릿수 성장했고, 특히 K뷰티 카테고리는 약 두 배 가까이 증가했다. 신 대표는 ""K뷰티가 일본 내에서 급성장한 배경에는 오프라인 체험 마케팅과 이를 연계한 온라인 구매 유도 전략이 주효했다""고 밝혔다. 그는 ""일본 시부야에서 진행된 체험형 오프라인 이벤트를 통해 10개 이상의 한국 브랜드가 현지 소비자와 직접 만났고, 이는 자연스럽게 아마존 재팬의 K뷰티 전용 온라인 페이지로 연결돼 실제 구매로 이어졌다""며 ""이 같은 온·오프라인 통합 마케팅 모델은 현재 미국 등 타 국가에서도 성공 사례로 벤치마킹되고 있다""고 덧붙였다. 한편 신화숙 대표는 LG전자·쿠팡 등을 거쳐 2022년 아마존 글로벌셀링 코리아에 합류했다. 현재는 국내 셀러의 아마존 온라인 스토어 개설과 해외 진출, 브랜드 성장을 지원하는 아마존 글로벌셀링 코리아를 총괄하고 있다. ◎공감언론 뉴시스 [email protected]",2025-07-03 02:14:41,ko,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The comment specifically mentions Anua as an example of a successful Korean skincare brand in the Japanese market, highlighting its strategy of using review-centered content for sensitive skin customers.

mov_DA2E23C14BDEEE568EE2B5A04AC34D38,"  SPR_COMBO[id]- Seiring dengan meningkatnya popularitas K-Beauty di seluruh dunia, ekspor kosmetik Korea Selatan untuk pertama kalinya berhasil melampaui Amerika Serikat. Setelah tahun lalu menyalip Jerman dan menempati posisi ketiga dalam ekspor kosmetik global, tren saat ini menunjukkan bahwa Korea Selatan akan segera menjadi pusat kecantikan terbesar kedua, setelah Prancis. Menurut Asosiasi Perdagangan Internasional Korea (APIK) pada tanggal 29 Juni, total ekspor kosmetik Korea Selatan antara Januari dan April 2025 mencapai 3,606 miliar USD (sekitar Rp58 triliun). Angka ini melampaui ekspor Amerika Serikat sebesar 3,570 miliar USD (sekitar Rp57 triliun) untuk periode yang sama, menandai tonggak sejarah di mana Korea Selatan melampaui Amerika Serikat dalam ekspor kosmetik. Pada kuartal pertama 2025, Korea sempat tertinggal dari Amerika Serikat dengan nilai ekspor 2,576 miliar USD (sekitar Rp41 triliun) dibandingkan Amerika Serikat sebesar 2,716 miliar USD (sekitar Rp43 triliun), namun berhasil membalikkan keadaan pada bulan April. Meskipun pada Januari 2024 ekspor kosmetik Korea mencapai 96 persen dari level Amerika Serikat (791,83 juta USD vs. 823,78 juta USD), kesenjangan tersebut melebar sebelum pembalikan peringkat baru-baru ini. Dikutip dari Allkpop, ekspor kosmetik Korea menunjukkan pertumbuhan pesat. Pada tahun 2023, Korea menduduki peringkat keempat global di belakang Prancis, Amerika Serikat, dan Jerman. Namun, Korea Selatan telah menyalip Jerman tahun lalu berkat peningkatan 20,3 persen secara tahunan, dibandingkan dengan pertumbuhan Prancis (6,3 persen), Amerika Serikat (1,1 persen), dan Jerman (6,9 persen). Pertumbuhan ini berlanjut hingga tahun 2025, dengan angka ekspor bulanan meningkat dari 750,82 juta USD pada Januari menjadi 1,029 miliar USD pada April. Seorang pakar industri kecantikan Korea Selatan menyatakan, ""Sangat menggembirakan bahwa merek kecantikan Korea telah melampaui merek Amerika Serikat seperti Estée Lauder, yang umumnya lebih mahal. Dengan meluasnya ekspor ke luar Amerika Utara hingga ke Eropa, kami mengharapkan pertumbuhan yang lebih besar tahun ini."" Berkat maraknya tren K-Beauty di seluruh dunia, perusahaan kosmetik Korea Selatan diproyeksikan akan mencatat hasil yang memecahkan rekor pada tahun 2025. Dengan ekspor yang kini melampaui Amerika Serikat, merek kecantikan Korea Selatan tidak hanya merambah pasar Asia dan Amerika Utara, tetapi juga Eropa dan Timur Tengah. Menurut penyedia data keuangan FnGuide, Amorepacific diperkirakan akan menghasilkan penjualan sebesar 4,3432 triliun KRW tahun ini, meningkat 11,79 persen secara tahunan. Demikian pula, produsen kosmetik terkemuka seperti Kolmar Korea dan Cosmax diperkirakan akan mencapai 2,7721 triliun KRW (+13,05 persen) dan 2,5361 triliun KRW (+17,08 persen). Prakiraan optimis ini mencerminkan keyakinan kuat terhadap kinerja luar negeri, yang telah menjadi pendorong utama pertumbuhan. Perusahaan kecantikan Korea Selatan mempercepat ekspansi mereka di luar Amerika Utara ke Eropa dan Timur Tengah. Menurut APIK, ekspor kosmetik Korea ke Polandia melonjak 121 persen secara tahunan dalam lima bulan pertama tahun 2025, mencapai 111,81 juta USD. Ekspor ke Prancis meningkat dua kali lipat (+106 persen), sementara Irlandia (+88 persen), Belgia (+51 persen), Italia (+45 persen), dan Denmark (+38 persen) juga mencatat peningkatan dua digit. Ekspor ke UEA naik 74 persen, dari 56,98 juta USD menjadi 99,28 juta USD. Perusahaan kecantikan perorangan telah menunjukkan hasil yang nyata. Volume pesanan APR di Eropa pada April–Mei 2,1 kali lebih besar daripada pada Q1. Perusahaan ini telah mengamankan kesepakatan pasokan dengan sekitar 20 perusahaan di Inggris, Spanyol, Jerman, Denmark, Bulgaria, dan Slovakia. Merek Anua milik Founders diluncurkan di Amazon Inggris pada Januari, diikuti oleh Amazon Jerman, Australia, dan Dubai pada Februari. Jumlah toko Boots yang menjual Anua meningkat dari 120 menjadi 470 tahun ini. Sementara itu, merek Peripera milik Clio memasuki jaringan ritel Italia OVS dan toko obat DM, dan merek Goodal mulai dijual di toko Kruidvat di Belanda dan Belgia bulan ini. Namun, masih ada beberapa kekhawatiran tentang keberlanjutan pertumbuhan K-Beauty. Risiko utamanya adalah potensi diberlakukannya kembali tarif timbal balik dari Amerika Serikat, yang saat ini ditangguhkan selama 90 hari dan akan berakhir pada 8 Agustus. Jika diberlakukan, kosmetik Korea Selatan akan menghadapi tarif sebesar 25 persen (tarif dasar 10 persen + tarif khusus negara 15 persen). Karena daya tarik global K-Beauty sebagian besar berasal dari keterjangkauan harga, hal ini dapat merusak daya saingnya. Seorang pejabat industri mengungkapkan, ""Jika Amerika Serikat mengenakan tarif seperti yang direncanakan, harga produk kecantikan Korea pasti akan naik. Meskipun ekspansi ke Eropa menjanjikan, Amerika Serikat tetap menjadi pasar terbesar, jadi ini bisa menjadi kemunduran yang serius. Karena produk kecantikan Korea pada awalnya relatif murah, bahkan tarif 15 persen mungkin hanya akan menaikkan harga beberapa dolar, yang kemungkinan akan menyebabkan lebih sedikit penolakan konsumen dibandingkan dengan merek kelas atas.""

Meskipun ekspansi ke Eropa menjanjikan, Amerika Serikat tetap menjadi pasar terbesar, jadi ini bisa menjadi kemunduran yang serius. Karena produk kecantikan Korea pada awalnya relatif murah, bahkan tarif 15 persen mungkin hanya akan menaikkan harga beberapa dolar, yang kemungkinan akan menyebabkan lebih sedikit penolakan konsumen dibandingkan dengan merek kelas atas.""

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If you're truly dedicated to discovering the best Korean face masks for a glass-skin glow, there's no better place to conduct your research than where it all started. That's why I spent more than three months in Seoul this year snooping around Korean skin care labs and investigating the shelves of Olive Young, South Korea's most popular beauty retailer. I've been using K-beauty products for years and was an enthusiastic early adopter of pimple patches and snail mucin, but there's nothing like a trip to Seoul to remind me that there's always something new to discover. The K-beauty market is intensely competitive, which means there are now thousands of Korean brands to sort through. But with some help from dermatologists and trusted industry experts (like veteran brand founders and product developers), I found a handful of face masks that were so good, I bought a second suitcase to haul them all home. Whether you're looking for a tingly pore treatment, an overnight sheet mask, or something for acne-prone skin, these are options that stood apart from the rest. The best Korean face masks, at a glanceBest for Dry Skin: Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask, $16Best for Dull Skin: Anua Peach 70 Niacin Brightening Collagen Mask, $21Best for Sensitive Skin: Dr. Althea Cushion Veil Calming Mask, $16Best for Mature Skin: Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Creamy Mask, $120Best for Acne-Prone Skin: Mediheal Tea Tree Essential Mask, $20 How we tested the best Korean face masksAccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron As a beauty editor who's covered K-beauty since 2016, I've tested hundreds of the most popular launches, including snail mucin creams, cushion foundations, and face masks like the ones you'll find on this list. I spent three months in Seoul last year researching the latest emerging trends in Korean mask technology by talking to brand founders, dermatologists, and cosmetic chemists. When reviewing each face mask, I make note of its ingredient list to determine which skin types it's best for, whether it's fragrance free, and its key benefits. I also consulted with K-beauty experts and dermatologists specializing in Korean skin care to curate each list and help Glamour readers make the most informed decision. Best Korean Face Mask for Dry Skin: Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Courtesy of brand Original photo from Sarah Y. Wu testing Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Chevron Chevron Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask $19 $14 Amazon $19 Soko Glam Key ingredients: Ultra-low molecular weight collagen, galactomyces, oligo hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, glycerinFragrance-free: YesFast facts: TikTok-viral overnight hydrogel mask; turns from white to clear as it dries; great for dry skin; leaves visible glow This Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask, an overnight sheet mask, has been trending on both TikTok and Hwahae (a K-beauty platform). It took over TikTok as the sheet mask you wear while you sleep, although dermatologists and the brand both say you can remove it after 3-4 hours when the hydrogel turns from white to clear. Y. Claire Chang, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at UnionDerm in New York City, says the ingredients (hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and galactomyces ferment filtrate) are great for “deep hydration” and to “help repair the skin, brighten, and calm.” Collagen also helps moisturize, says Dr. Hwang, “but the effectiveness may be limited to superficial hydration.” If you're looking for a mask that treats fine lines, he recommends looking for ingredients like “retinoids or peptides,” but this is the one to pick for intense hydration. Grab this when your skin's dehydrated or getting rough. “It leaves my face feeling plumper and softer for days,” says Dr. Chang. Glamour contributor Sarah Y. Wu also loves this collagen face mask because of its impressive radiance-boosting effects. “I remember seeing people use this all over my FYP,” she says. “They'd take it off and have immediate glass skin. I can now confirm that's not a filter; you leave it on for so long that it really traps the moisture in your skin. I rarely have the patience to do a three-hour long face mask, but the nice thing about the hydrogel is that it comes in two pieces that cling to my face. That means I can wear it while working and still chug coffee without the mask falling off. The most impressive thing about this is that by the time it turns clear and I take it off, my skin doesn't even feel damp anymore but somehow still has that glassy glow.” Best Korean Face Mask for Mature Skin: Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Creamy Mask Courtesy of brand Original photo from Sarah Y. Wu testing Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Creamy Mask Chevron Chevron Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Creamy Mask $120 $114 Amazon Key ingredients: Panax ginseng root extract, enzyme treated ginseng saponins, ginseng peptides, shea butter, squalaneFragrance-free: NoFast facts: Dermatologist favorite for supporting skin between treatments; visible smoothing and plumping effect; recommended for dry/dull/mature skin; not recommended for oily or acne-prone skin This Korean sheet mask feels like a vacation to Sulwhasoo's flagship spa in Seoul. Coated in the brand's signature ginseng-derived ingredients, this powerful treatment is our top recommendation for mature skin. “This mask offers more than superficial hydration—its ginseng-based formulation exhibits antioxidative effects, which help with photoaging management,” says Dr. Hwang. He highlights the inclusion of panax ginseng root extract, which “improves microcirculation, supporting long-term collagen remodeling.” The mask also contains firming ginseng peptides, as well as moisturizing shea butter and squalane. According to Dr. Hwang, the former “delivers moisture for depleted skin,” while the latter “mimics the skin's natural sebum to restore suppleness without clogging pores.” While he recommends it for “aged, dry, or menopausal skin,” he says it's not the best fit for oily or acne-prone skin. “For those with atrophic wrinkles or thin skin, it serves as an effective support treatment in between in-clinic procedures,” he says. Wu swears by this 15-minute mask for event prep. “Each foil-backed piece is coated with just the right amount of creamy serum,” she says. “Compared to face masks that drip essence when you open them, these have a totally different feel. But don't worry: You're definitely getting visible results. No matter how tired my skin looks, a single treatment leaves my complexion naturally radiant, plumped, and healthy-looking.” Best Korean Face Mask for Sensitive Skin: Dr. Althea Cushion Veil Calming Mask Courtesy of brand Original photo from Sarah Y.

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. If you're truly dedicated to discovering the best Korean face masks for a glass-skin glow, there's no better place to conduct your research than where it all started. That's why I spent more than three months in Seoul this year snooping around Korean skin care labs and investigating the shelves of Olive Young, South Korea's most popular beauty retailer. I've been using K-beauty products for years and was an enthusiastic early adopter of pimple patches and snail mucin, but there's nothing like a trip to Seoul to remind me that there's always something new to discover. The K-beauty market is intensely competitive, which means there are now thousands of Korean brands to sort through. But with some help from dermatologists and trusted industry experts (like veteran brand founders and product developers), I found a handful of face masks that were so good, I bought a second suitcase to haul them all home. Whether you're looking for a tingly pore treatment, an overnight sheet mask, or something for acne-prone skin, these are options that stood apart from the rest. The best Korean face masks, at a glanceBest for Dry Skin: Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask, $16Best for Dull Skin: Anua Peach 70 Niacin Brightening Collagen Mask, $21Best for Sensitive Skin: Dr. Althea Cushion Veil Calming Mask, $16Best for Mature Skin: Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Creamy Mask, $120Best for Acne-Prone Skin: Mediheal Tea Tree Essential Mask, $20 How we tested the best Korean face masksAccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron As a beauty editor who's covered K-beauty since 2016, I've tested hundreds of the most popular launches, including snail mucin creams, cushion foundations, and face masks like the ones you'll find on this list. I spent three months in Seoul last year researching the latest emerging trends in Korean mask technology by talking to brand founders, dermatologists, and cosmetic chemists. When reviewing each face mask, I make note of its ingredient list to determine which skin types it's best for, whether it's fragrance free, and its key benefits. I also consulted with K-beauty experts and dermatologists specializing in Korean skin care to curate each list and help Glamour readers make the most informed decision. Best Korean Face Mask for Dry Skin: Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Courtesy of brand Original photo from Sarah Y. Wu testing Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask Chevron Chevron Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask $19 $14 Amazon $19 Soko Glam Key ingredients: Ultra-low molecular weight collagen, galactomyces, oligo hyaluronic acid, niacinamide, glycerinFragrance-free: YesFast facts: TikTok-viral overnight hydrogel mask; turns from white to clear as it dries; great for dry skin; leaves visible glow This Biodance Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask, an overnight sheet mask, has been trending on both TikTok and Hwahae (a K-beauty platform). It took over TikTok as the sheet mask you wear while you sleep, although dermatologists and the brand both say you can remove it after 3-4 hours when the hydrogel turns from white to clear. Y. Claire Chang, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at UnionDerm in New York City, says the ingredients (hyaluronic acid, glycerin, and galactomyces ferment filtrate) are great for “deep hydration” and to “help repair the skin, brighten, and calm.” Collagen also helps moisturize, says Dr. Hwang, “but the effectiveness may be limited to superficial hydration.” If you're looking for a mask that treats fine lines, he recommends looking for ingredients like “retinoids or peptides,” but this is the one to pick for intense hydration. Grab this when your skin's dehydrated or getting rough. “It leaves my face feeling plumper and softer for days,” says Dr. Chang. Glamour contributor Sarah Y. Wu also loves this collagen face mask because of its impressive radiance-boosting effects. “I remember seeing people use this all over my FYP,” she says. “They'd take it off and have immediate glass skin. I can now confirm that's not a filter; you leave it on for so long that it really traps the moisture in your skin. I rarely have the patience to do a three-hour long face mask, but the nice thing about the hydrogel is that it comes in two pieces that cling to my face. That means I can wear it while working and still chug coffee without the mask falling off. The most impressive thing about this is that by the time it turns clear and I take it off, my skin doesn't even feel damp anymore but somehow still has that glassy glow.” Best Korean Face Mask for Mature Skin: Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Renewing Creamy Mask Courtesy of brand Original photo from Sarah Y.

Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil Das Cleanasing Oil lässt sich gut verteilen und abwaschen. Allerdings ist es stark parfümiert, was für mich leider wirklich nicht sein muss. Heartleaf Quercetinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam Der Gel schäumt schön auf und lässt sich gut verteilen. Es hat gründlich und nachhaltig gereinigt. An Tagen, an denen meine Haut etwas dehydriert war, war der Cleanser definitiv zu viel. Ich würde ihn nur für ölige und nicht zu sensible Haut empfehlen. Rice 70 Glow Milky Toner Der Toner hat eine milchige, samtige Textur und zieht gut ein. Er hat meine Haut ganz gut hydriert und durchaus beruhigt. Die enthaltenen aufhellenden Wirkstoffe wie Ascorbic Acid und Niacinamid habe ich aber schon in meiner Routine. Niacinamide 10 TXA 4 Serum Meine Haut toleriert ein Serum mit 10% Niacinamid gut. Es enthält einige Wirkstoffe, die ich sehr gerne mag. Das Serum zieht gut ein und ist nicht klebrig. Allerdings tun Arbutin und Tranexamic Acid nicht so viel für meine Haut. Azelaic Acid 10 Hyaluron Redness Soothing Serum Das Beste kommt zum Schluss! Dieses Serum ist ein neuer Favorit. Ich hatte vor einiger Zeit das Serum selbst gekauft und war schnell begeistert. Ich vertrage eine Azelainkonzentration von mehr als 10% nicht gut, also ist das hier genau richtig. Dazu kommen, Extrakte von grünem Tee, Aloe, Tigergras, etwas Squalane, Zink und Ceramid NP.

n1707d1,"  My perfect skincare combo for my dry skin before makeup (it took me a long time to figure it out, my skin used to do the same with foundation) is gentle cleanser (I use glossier gentle jelly milky cleanser. . whatever it's called lol, but any will work, I also lov cetaphil gentle daily cleanser, my mom swears by that one.) hydrating milky toner (I love the Anua rice 70 glow milky toner) if you want, you can do a vitamin c serum here, if your skin can handle it, if not, you don't have to, AND the PERFECT moisturizer under makeup is the Naturium multi peptide moisturizer. . and it's drugstore. It's literally hands down the best under makeup. I also sometimes the day I'm wearing makeup, do the naturium bha toner, after cleansing, once skin is dry, to get rid of any dead skin. . that's another great prep step before makeup, and then I wait for that to dry, and follow with the soothing milky toner + moisturizer.

It's literally hands down the best under makeup. I also sometimes the day I'm wearing makeup, do the naturium bha toner, after cleansing, once skin is dry, to get rid of any dead skin. . that's another great prep step before makeup, and then I wait for that to dry, and follow with the soothing milky toner + moisturizer.

mov_3035CB4FEB1D1ED60CBE8DDCE7BFA6C4,"  Over 67% of Gen Z consumers now discover beauty products via TikTok, a figure that's dramatically altering the landscape of skincare. But as viral trends like 'morning shed' – involving jaw bras and mouth taping – gain traction, a critical question arises: are these practices genuinely beneficial, or are they a potentially harmful echo of the ever-expanding K-Beauty influence? This isn't simply about fleeting fads; it's a harbinger of a future where self-administered 'skin fitness' regimes, driven by social media and rooted in Eastern traditions, become increasingly commonplace – and increasingly scrutinized. The 'Morning Shed' Phenomenon: Beyond the Viral Hype The 'morning shed' trend, popularized on TikTok, centers around the idea of optimizing facial structure and skin health through devices like jaw bras (designed to encourage a defined jawline) and mouth taping (claiming to promote nasal breathing and improve skin hydration). While proponents tout benefits like reduced puffiness and improved skin elasticity, dermatologists are sounding the alarm. K-Beauty, with its emphasis on preventative care and innovative techniques, often serves as the inspiration for these trends, but the rapid adoption without professional guidance is raising concerns. Dr. Anya Sharma, a leading dermatologist, cautions, “While the principles behind some of these practices – like encouraging lymphatic drainage – aren't inherently flawed, the execution and lack of personalized assessment can be detrimental. Jaw bras, for example, can exacerbate TMJ disorders, and improper mouth taping can lead to breathing difficulties.” The core issue isn't the *idea* of targeted skin improvement, but the democratization of potentially complex treatments without the necessary expertise. The K-Beauty Revolution: From Niche Market to Global Dominance The surge in popularity of K-Beauty isn't accidental. Korean skincare prioritizes gentle, preventative measures, focusing on hydration, protection, and a multi-step routine. Brands like Anua, recently launched exclusively in India through Nykaa, are capitalizing on this demand, offering innovative formulations and a holistic approach to skincare. This isn't just about selling products; it's about selling a philosophy. The success of K-Beauty in India, and globally, highlights a shift in consumer preferences. Traditional Western skincare often focuses on reactive treatments – addressing problems *after* they arise. K-Beauty, conversely, emphasizes proactive prevention. This resonates particularly strongly with younger demographics who are increasingly invested in long-term skin health. The Rise of 'Skinimalism' and Personalized Skincare Interestingly, alongside the elaborate multi-step K-Beauty routines, we're also witnessing the rise of 'skinimalism' – a minimalist approach to skincare focusing on essential products and simplifying routines. This apparent contradiction reveals a deeper trend: a growing desire for personalized skincare solutions. Consumers are no longer satisfied with one-size-fits-all products; they want routines tailored to their specific skin type, concerns, and lifestyle. This demand for personalization is fueling the growth of at-home skin analysis tools and AI-powered skincare recommendations. Expect to see more brands integrating technology to provide customized product formulations and treatment plans, effectively bringing the expertise of a dermatologist directly to the consumer. The Future of 'Skin Fitness': Tech, Personalization, and Regulation The 'skin fitness' trend, encompassing everything from DIY treatments to advanced at-home devices, is poised for significant growth. However, this expansion will necessitate increased regulation and a greater emphasis on consumer education. The current landscape is largely unregulated, leaving consumers vulnerable to misleading claims and potentially harmful practices. We can anticipate the following developments: Increased FDA/Regulatory Scrutiny: Expect stricter regulations surrounding at-home skincare devices and a crackdown on unsubstantiated claims. AI-Powered Dermatological Tools: AI-driven apps and devices will become more sophisticated, offering accurate skin analysis and personalized recommendations. The Rise of 'Derm-Tech' Brands: Brands founded by dermatologists or backed by scientific research will gain prominence, offering credibility and reassurance. Integration with Wearable Technology: Skincare will increasingly integrate with wearable technology, monitoring skin hydration levels, UV exposure, and other key metrics.

Focus on gentle, hydrating products and prioritize preventative care. Start with a simple routine and gradually introduce new products, paying attention to how your skin responds. Will AI-powered skincare tools replace dermatologists?...","Over 67% of Gen Z consumers now discover beauty products via TikTok, a figure that's dramatically altering the landscape of skincare. But as viral trends like 'morning shed' – involving jaw bras and mouth taping – gain traction, a critical question arises: are these practices genuinely beneficial, or are they a potentially harmful echo of the ever-expanding K-Beauty influence? This isn't simply about fleeting fads; it's a harbinger of a future where self-administered 'skin fitness' regimes, driven by social media and rooted in Eastern traditions, become increasingly commonplace – and increasingly scrutinized. The 'Morning Shed' Phenomenon: Beyond the Viral Hype The 'morning shed' trend, popularized on TikTok, centers around the idea of optimizing facial structure and skin health through devices like jaw bras (designed to encourage a defined jawline) and mouth taping (claiming to promote nasal breathing and improve skin hydration). While proponents tout benefits like reduced puffiness and improved skin elasticity, dermatologists are sounding the alarm. K-Beauty, with its emphasis on preventative care and innovative techniques, often serves as the inspiration for these trends, but the rapid adoption without professional guidance is raising concerns. Dr. Anya Sharma, a leading dermatologist, cautions, “While the principles behind some of these practices – like encouraging lymphatic drainage – aren't inherently flawed, the execution and lack of personalized assessment can be detrimental. Jaw bras, for example, can exacerbate TMJ disorders, and improper mouth taping can lead to breathing difficulties.” The core issue isn't the *idea* of targeted skin improvement, but the democratization of potentially complex treatments without the necessary expertise. The K-Beauty Revolution: From Niche Market to Global Dominance The surge in popularity of K-Beauty isn't accidental. Korean skincare prioritizes gentle, preventative measures, focusing on hydration, protection, and a multi-step routine. Brands like Anua, recently launched exclusively in India through Nykaa, are capitalizing on this demand, offering innovative formulations and a holistic approach to skincare. This isn't just about selling products; it's about selling a philosophy. The success of K-Beauty in India, and globally, highlights a shift in consumer preferences.

mov_B2A6A378182326E5146681A3999D8D60,"  Seoul, South Korea , July 07, 2025     As Amazon Prime Day approaches, SkinSeoul is launching its own bold counter-event, The Great Glow Up 2025, featuring even lower prices on top-rated Korean skincare products — with a guarantee to match Amazon's prices. The AI-powered Korean beauty startup is rapidly establishing itself as the go-to destination for K-beauty enthusiasts seeking real value and exclusive access to the most sought-after skincare brands. The Great Glow up 2025 SkinSeoul offers a wide selection of Korean skincare products, many of which have gained significant attention from customers during this Prime Day period. Among the highlights are two categories of standout products: those priced lower than Amazon's listings, and unique items that are difficult to find outside of SkinSeoul's platform. Several products have quickly become customer favorites due to their unbeatable discounts compared to Amazon, while others are regarded as hidden gems—trending skincare essentials that shoppers cannot easily purchase elsewhere. “We plan to invest in building a robust database for superior personalized experiences, expanding into 10 global markets, advancing AI agent technology, optimizing our distribution and fulfillment models, and enhancing our beauty marketing efforts,” said Kuenyoung Park, CEO of SkinSeoul. With The Great Glow Up 2025, SkinSeoul not only aims to provide exceptional deals but also to redefine how K-beauty fans worldwide discover and shop for skincare products during one of the year's biggest shopping events. In an aggressive pricing move, SkinSeoul has introduced a real-time price-matching policy that ensures every product is sold at a lower price than its equivalent on Amazon. If any product is found to be more expensive on SkinSeoul during Prime Day, customers are eligible for a price difference refund — no questions asked. “We don't just compete with Amazon — we aim to beat them,” said a SkinSeoul spokesperson. “The Great Glow Up 2025 should mean the best deals, and we're making sure our customers get exactly that.” - https://skin-seoul.com/campaign/ggu-lowest-price/ Examples of lowest-price favorites include: NEW Zero Pore Pad 2.0 Renewal Inner Cover Clip (medicube), Collagen Night Wrapping Mask (medicube), Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil - 200ml, 1pack (Anua), Heartleaf Quercetinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam (Anua), Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - 100ml, 1pack (COSRX), Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask (medicube), Deep Vita C Capsule Cream (medicube), Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream (medicube), Revive Serum - 30ml, 1pack (Beauty of Joseon), Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream - 100ml, 1pack (COSRX). What sets SkinSeoul further apart is its unmatched catalog of Korean skincare. While Amazon carries a limited selection of K-beauty products, SkinSeoul offers a range of both classics and emerging trendsetters — including brands and SKUs that are hard to find anywhere else. From TikTok-viral items to up-and-coming indie labels, SkinSeoul gives customers first access to what's trending in Seoul's skincare scene. - https://skin-seoul.com/campaign/ggu-hidden-gem/  Examples of hidden gems include: Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Emulsion for Combination Skin (LANEIGE), Vita Collagen Ampoule (EUNYUL), Collagen Green Tea Ceramide Bounce Cream (INNISFREE), Daily Repair Toner (Dr.Belmeur), Hyaluronic Moisture Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++ (INNISFREE), Vegan Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++ (HYGGEE), Age Reviving Micro Crystal Patch Plus 3packs x (DERMAFIRM), Callus Multi Gold Lifting Cream (MEDIHEAL), Idebenone Sunblock (UltraV), Tone Up No Sebum Sunscreen EX SPF50+ PA++++ (INNISFREE). These highlights are just a glimpse — SkinSeoul's full catalog includes an even broader range of hard-to-find and competitively priced offerings, giving K-beauty fans a richer, more dynamic shopping experience than anywhere else. “As global demand for K-beauty grows, Amazon has struggled to keep up with the pace and depth of selection.

mov_310E3E5CFFF886A5BE6B76130B6EA707,"  Seoul, South Korea , July 07, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- As Amazon Prime Day approaches, SkinSeoul is launching its own bold counter-event, The Great Glow Up 2025, featuring even lower prices on top-rated Korean skincare products — with a guarantee to match Amazon's prices. The AI-powered Korean beauty startup is rapidly establishing itself as the go-to destination for K-beauty enthusiasts seeking real value and exclusive access to the most sought-after skincare brands. The Great Glow up 2025 SkinSeoul offers a wide selection of Korean skincare products, many of which have gained significant attention from customers during this Prime Day period. Among the highlights are two categories of standout products: those priced lower than Amazon's listings, and unique items that are difficult to find outside of SkinSeoul's platform. Several products have quickly become customer favorites due to their unbeatable discounts compared to Amazon, while others are regarded as hidden gems—trending skincare essentials that shoppers cannot easily purchase elsewhere. “We plan to invest in building a robust database for superior personalized experiences, expanding into 10 global markets, advancing AI agent technology, optimizing our distribution and fulfillment models, and enhancing our beauty marketing efforts,” said Kuenyoung Park, CEO of SkinSeoul. With The Great Glow Up 2025, SkinSeoul not only aims to provide exceptional deals but also to redefine how K-beauty fans worldwide discover and shop for skincare products during one of the year's biggest shopping events. In an aggressive pricing move, SkinSeoul has introduced a real-time price-matching policy that ensures every product is sold at a lower price than its equivalent on Amazon. If any product is found to be more expensive on SkinSeoul during Prime Day, customers are eligible for a price difference refund — no questions asked. “We don't just compete with Amazon — we aim to beat them,” said a SkinSeoul spokesperson. “The Great Glow Up 2025 should mean the best deals, and we're making sure our customers get exactly that.” - https://skin-seoul.com/campaign/ggu-lowest-price/ Examples of lowest-price favorites include: NEW Zero Pore Pad 2.0 Renewal Inner Cover Clip (medicube), Collagen Night Wrapping Mask (medicube), Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil - 200ml, 1pack (Anua), Heartleaf Quercetinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam (Anua), Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - 100ml, 1pack (COSRX), Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask (medicube), Deep Vita C Capsule Cream (medicube), Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream (medicube), Revive Serum - 30ml, 1pack (Beauty of Joseon), Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream - 100ml, 1pack (COSRX). What sets SkinSeoul further apart is its unmatched catalog of Korean skincare. While Amazon carries a limited selection of K-beauty products, SkinSeoul offers a range of both classics and emerging trendsetters — including brands and SKUs that are hard to find anywhere else. From TikTok-viral items to up-and-coming indie labels, SkinSeoul gives customers first access to what's trending in Seoul's skincare scene. - https://skin-seoul.com/campaign/ggu-hidden-gem/  Examples of hidden gems include: Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Emulsion for Combination Skin (LANEIGE), Vita Collagen Ampoule (EUNYUL), Collagen Green Tea Ceramide Bounce Cream (INNISFREE), Daily Repair Toner (Dr.Belmeur), Hyaluronic Moisture Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++ (INNISFREE), Vegan Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++ (HYGGEE), Age Reviving Micro Crystal Patch Plus 3packs x (DERMAFIRM), Callus Multi Gold Lifting Cream (MEDIHEAL), Idebenone Sunblock (UltraV), Tone Up No Sebum Sunscreen EX SPF50+ PA++++ (INNISFREE).

Several products have quickly become customer favorites due to their unbeatable discounts compared to Amazon, while others are regarded as hidden gems—trending skincare essentials that shoppers cannot easily purchase elsewhere. “We plan to invest in building a robust database for superior personalized experiences, expanding into 10 global markets, advancing AI agent technology, optimizing our distribution and fulfillment models, and enhancing our beauty marketing efforts,” said Kuenyoung Park, CEO of SkinSeoul.

If any product is found to be more expensive on SkinSeoul during Prime Day, customers are eligible for a price difference refund — no questions asked. “We don't just compete with Amazon — we aim to beat them,” said a SkinSeoul spokesperson. “The Great Glow Up 2025 should mean the best deals, and we're making sure our customers get exactly that.” - https://skin-seoul.com/campaign/ggu-lowest-price/ Examples of lowest-price favorites include: NEW Zero Pore Pad 2.0 Renewal Inner Cover Clip (medicube), Collagen Night Wrapping Mask (medicube), Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil - 200ml, 1pack (Anua), Heartleaf Quercetinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam (Anua), Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - 100ml, 1pack (COSRX), Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask (medicube), Deep Vita C Capsule Cream (medicube), Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream (medicube), Revive Serum - 30ml, 1pack (Beauty of Joseon), Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream - 100ml, 1pack (COSRX).

Among the highlights are two categories of standout products: those priced lower than Amazon's listings, and unique items that are difficult to find outside of SkinSeoul's platform. Several products have quickly become customer favorites due to their unbeatable discounts compared to Amazon, while others are regarded as hidden gems—trending skincare essentials that shoppers cannot easily purchase elsewhere. “We plan to invest in building a robust database for superior personalized experiences, expanding into 10 global markets, advancing AI agent technology, optimizing our distribution and fulfillment models, and enhancing our beauty marketing efforts,” said Kuenyoung Park, CEO of SkinSeoul. With The Great Glow Up 2025, SkinSeoul not only aims to provide exceptional deals but also to redefine how K-beauty fans worldwide discover and shop for skincare products during one of the year's biggest shopping events. In an aggressive pricing move, SkinSeoul has introduced a real-time price-matching policy that ensures every product is sold at a lower price than its equivalent on Amazon. If any product is found to be more expensive on SkinSeoul during Prime Day, customers are eligible for a price difference refund — no questions asked. “We don't just compete with Amazon — we aim to beat them,” said a SkinSeoul spokesperson. “The Great Glow Up 2025 should mean the best deals, and we're making sure our customers get exactly that.” - Examples of lowest-price favorites include: NEW Zero Pore Pad 2.0 Renewal Inner Cover Clip (medicube), Collagen Night Wrapping Mask (medicube), Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil - 200ml, 1pack (Anua), Heartleaf Quercetinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam (Anua), Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence - 100ml, 1pack (COSRX), Salmon PDRN Pink Collagen Jelly Gel Mask (medicube), Deep Vita C Capsule Cream (medicube), Collagen Niacinamide Jelly Cream (medicube), Revive Serum - 30ml, 1pack (Beauty of Joseon), Advanced Snail 92 All In One Cream - 100ml, 1pack (COSRX). What sets SkinSeoul further apart is its unmatched catalog of Korean skincare. While Amazon carries a limited selection of K-beauty products, SkinSeoul offers a range of both classics and emerging trendsetters — including brands and SKUs that are hard to find anywhere else. From TikTok-viral items to up-and-coming indie labels, SkinSeoul gives customers first access to what's trending in Seoul's skincare scene. - Examples of hidden gems include: Water Bank Blue Hyaluronic Emulsion for Combination Skin (LANEIGE), Vita Collagen Ampoule (EUNYUL), Collagen Green Tea Ceramide Bounce Cream (INNISFREE), Daily Repair Toner (Dr.Belmeur), Hyaluronic Moisture Sun Cream SPF50+ PA++++ (INNISFREE), Vegan Sunscreen SPF50+ PA++++ (HYGGEE), Age Reviving Micro Crystal Patch Plus 3packs x (DERMAFIRM), Callus Multi Gold Lifting Cream (MEDIHEAL), Idebenone Sunblock (UltraV), Tone Up No Sebum Sunscreen EX SPF50+ PA++++ (INNISFREE).

mov_27D5CAF6F05A62CD128CE9E1F5F3E24C,"  The sales on these beloved products could be gone before Prime Day is even over. Amazon Prime Day deals are here for four days this year, but that doesn't mean all your favorite products will be on sale for that full length of time. Popular products tend to sell out quickly when the discounts are this deep, so if you've had your eye on something, you don't want to miss your chance to grab it on sale. Below, we tracked down some of the most beloved products that are on sale right now — and all of these have historically sold out quickly. If you spot something on this list that you've been waiting to add to your cart, wait no more. A deal this good may not come around again for a while. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. Stasher 10-piece reusable silicone storage bag set (40% off list price) Stasher's popular reusable storage bags can help you cut down on plastic waste (as well as the cost of buying single-use plastic bags), and we don't expect them to last long on the shelves. This 10-pack comes with bags in six different sizes, as well as four stretch lids. All are made with silicone and are safe for use in the dishwasher, freezer, microwave and oven. The TikTok-viral Meridian body hair trimmer (40% off list price) Rarely on sale for a price this low, this Meridian body hair trimmer is a viral product that may see a ton of orders this Prime Day (plenty of reviews mention first seeing it on TikTok). The trimmer can be used by both men and women, is 100% waterproof and promises a close shave without irritation, redness, ingrown hair, razor burn or bumps. It's cordless and rechargeable, and comes with an anti-nick guard to keep you safe. Cabeau TNE travel neck pillow (25% off list price) You might be familiar with Cabeau's popular neck pillows, and their TNE memory foam pillow will be on sale for Prime Day. Available in a bunch of different colors, this pillow is a must-have for flights, long train or car rides and more: It has seat straps you can attach to your chair to keep your head and neck in alignment, prevents your head from falling forward with ""head catch"" technology and is made with ergonomic memory foam. It also comes with a travel bag you can attach to your luggage. A bestselling absorbent and slip-resistant bath mat (50% off list price) An already affordable product just got an even better price. Gorilla Grip reports that their popular bath mat — which has 4.3 stars across more than 76,000 ratings — sold over 10,000 units in the past month alone, so with this half-off discount, we're expecting shoppers to flock here. Made with cozy, plush chenille, the absorbent bath mat has a textured rubber backing and is slip- and fade-resistant. It comes in so many sizes and colors, so you can match your bathroom's style and needs easily. Anua niacinamide 10 + TXA 4 serum (30% off list price) With the ongoing tariff situation potentially affecting the prices of Korean skin care and beauty products, as well as K-beauty's general popularity during Prime Day, we could see products like this Anua serum selling out. The brand reports that more than 40,000 units of the serum were bought in just the last month, too. Suitable for all skin types, the fragrance-free serum contains 10% niacinamide, as well as other skin-boosting ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramide to help your skin glow and provide hydration. The texture is described as lightweight and non-greasy, making this an easy add to any skin care routine. Lumineux teeth whitening strips (33% off list price) Yes, the ever-popular Crest 3D Whitestrips will be on sale for Prime Day (they appear elsewhere on this list), but we could also see this Lumineux alternative selling out too — it's garnered over 56,000 ratings with a 4.1-star average. These also come dentist-recommended for patients with sensitive teeth. The strips are enamel-safe and peroxide-free, relying on natural ingredients like coconut oil, lemon peel oil and more. Sol de Janeiro hair and body perfume mist (20% off list price) A constant Amazon beauty bestseller, we pretty much never see this Sol de Janeiro perfume mist on sale, so be prepared to grab it while you can. The mist comes in a ton of different scents, though the beachy, summer-ready Cheirosa '62 is probably the most well-known (it matches the viral Brazilian Bum Bum Cream scent, which also appears on this list). You can get a bottle in two sizes, including one that's travel-friendly. Blueair's newest air purifier (20% off list price) This Prime Day is the first time ever that Blueair's newest air purifier, the Blue Signature, is on sale, so you'll want to jump on this deal while you can. The purifier boasts seven stages of filtration, odor-blocking technology and an air quality indicator. You can control it using the accompanying app to set a schedule and get alerts for when the filter needs replacing. The purifier can clean up to 3,385 square feet and can even double as a table to make it multifunctional. Cocokind ceramide barrier serum (25% off list price) Another offering from a popular skin care brand, Cocokind's ceramide barrier serum can help soothe and hydrate the skin barrier using squalane and beta-glucan, as well as five ceramides. According to the brand, these ingredients can offer more hydration than hyaluronic acid, and with a comfortable, lightweight feel, the serum can layer with retinol, vitamin C and other skin care products and instantly absorb into the skin. HexClad 6-piece nonstick fry pan set (20% off list price) You're probably familiar with HexClad, the Gordon Ramsay-approved cookware brand. We could see this 6-piece set going quickly with the offered discount: It contains fry pans of three sizes (8-, 10- and 12-inch) as well as lids for each. The hexagonal nonstick surface provides an even sear and is easy to clean, not to mention dishwasher- and oven-safe up to 400 degrees....","The sales on these beloved products could be gone before Prime Day is even over.

Lumineux teeth whitening strips (33% off list price) Yes, the ever-popular Crest 3D Whitestrips will be on sale for Prime Day (they appear elsewhere on this list), but we could also see this Lumineux alternative selling out too — it's garnered over 56,000 ratings with a 4.1-star average. These also come dentist-recommended for patients with sensitive teeth. The strips are enamel-safe and peroxide-free, relying on natural ingredients like coconut oil, lemon peel oil and more. Sol de Janeiro hair and body perfume mist (20% off list price) A constant Amazon beauty bestseller, we pretty much never see this Sol de Janeiro perfume mist on sale, so be prepared to grab it while you can. The mist comes in a ton of different scents, though the beachy, summer-ready Cheirosa '62 is probably the most well-known (it matches the viral Brazilian Bum Bum Cream scent, which also appears on this list). You can get a bottle in two sizes, including one that's travel-friendly. Blueair's newest air purifier (20% off list price) This Prime Day is the first time ever that Blueair's newest air purifier, the Blue Signature, is on sale, so you'll want to jump on this deal while you can. The purifier boasts seven stages of filtration, odor-blocking technology and an air quality indicator. You can control it using the accompanying app to set a schedule and get alerts for when the filter needs replacing. The purifier can clean up to 3,385 square feet and can even double as a table to make it multifunctional. Cocokind ceramide barrier serum (25% off list price) Another offering from a popular skin care brand, Cocokind's ceramide barrier serum can help soothe and hydrate the skin barrier using squalane and beta-glucan, as well as five ceramides. According to the brand, these ingredients can offer more hydration than hyaluronic acid, and with a comfortable, lightweight feel, the serum can layer with retinol, vitamin C and other skin care products and instantly absorb into the skin. HexClad 6-piece nonstick fry pan set (20% off list price) You're probably familiar with HexClad, the Gordon Ramsay-approved cookware brand. We could see this 6-piece set going quickly with the offered discount: It contains fry pans of three sizes (8-, 10- and 12-inch) as well as lids for each.

That's right, it's the final Amazon Prime Day, which means all the Korean beauty steals you've been eyeing will disappear after the clock strikes midnight (very Cinderella-core—am I right?) . Whether you open a tab to sleuth-shop at work or make a deciding move on a late-night scroll, there's still plenty of glowy skin-care products and innovative new makeup formulas up for grabs. And while Amazon likes to lean into its reputation of being the “Everything Store,” a targeted approach to scoping out the best Prime Day deals always pays off. Those shopping the beauty aisle should make the Prime Day K-beauty deals their first port of call. Why, you ask? Korean beauty products are renowned for their innovative formulas, skincare-first ingredients, and unique textures—in addition to being just an absolute treat to use and hold. From jelly-like serums and and whipped moisturizers that melt into skin to cushion compacts that snap shut with a satisfying click, there's a tactile delight to every step. Plus, who doesn't delight at super cute packaging? Korean beauty products are often not only wildly effective, but can also spark a bit of joy with each use.

We've rounded up over 80 curated options of top-tier Korean beauty buys (plus a few new obsessions) to choose from right here, so all you have to do is tap “add to cart.” Happy shopping! The Best Prime Day Beauty Deals, By Category Sometimes you want to peruse the Amazon Prime Day deals, other times, you know exactly what you're looking for. To help you quickly find a specific item, we've broken our guide into categories below. Prime Day Korean Cleanser Deals The best Korean face washes typically focus on soothing, gentle ingredients. Whether you're opting for a cleansing oil to melt away makeup and SPF, or a hydrating foaming cleanser—either make a great first step in any routine. Though, ideally, you'll do both as part of the Korean cleansing method, a.k.a the lauded double cleanse. From balms to low ph gel, anyone of these picks will give you an effective cleanse, sans irritation. Banila Co Clean it Zero Original Cleansing Balm This pick was Vogue beauty shopping writer Conçetta Ciarlo's intro into the K-Beauty world back in her university days, before the category fully broke mainstream in the US. “A radom Amazon purchase in 2017 turned into a consistant favorite for me—just one scoop of the whipped-texture product lathers effortlessy, removing waterproof makeup with ease,” she says. CosRx Low pH Good Morning Gel Face Cleanser This gel cleanser is safe for all skin types to use, helping maintain the barrier rather than stripping it. Its pH-balanced and contains tea tree oil and BHA to soothe the skin and banish breakouts. Sulwhasoo Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Christina Chung is a fan of this gentle cleanser, noting that it's become a favorite for everyone in her family, from teens to elders. “Sulwhasoo products are generally ginseng-based and fabulous for sensitive skin types,” she previously told Vogue. Anua Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil Chock full of anti-inflammatory, antibacterial ingredients like turmeric and heartland extract, this cleansing oil soothes while removing makeup and SPF. Post wash, skin feels fresh and hydrated skin, thanks to conditioning jojoba, grapeseed, and olive oils. Mixsoon This pH-balanced foam cleanser calms while it cleanses—perfect for sensitive, acne-prone skin. The combination of centella asiatica and salicylic acid, it soothes while gently exfoliating, to keep breakouts in check without stripping essential moisture. Torriden This ultra-gentle, pH-balanced face wash lathers away impurities.

n2wm3fu,"  I think you should forgo the foundation altogether, it doesn't match you and actually adds a bit of an aged look because it crinkles your skin too much. I think people with freckles are very hard on themselves; and you don't realize how cute you are with freckles people try to make fake freckles to have what you have. Your skin is not aged, no wrinkles; you just need to take better care of your skin. Your skin is dull and prone to dryness from what I see, Invest in taking care of your skin, because you won't have to worry about aging if you moisturize properly and use the right products. I love Korean beauty products, they really uplift and hydrate your skin, I have glass skin from using the products every day for two weeks when I started my Korean beauty devotion— I would highly recommend using medicube, MISSHA, or ANUA skin care products, I myself use Medicube and MISSHA daily. I have never gone back to over counter products like neutrogena or even la roche possay literally it would be a disgrace and a dishonor to my skin. This is a beautiful start to long lasting plump, hydrated, and supple soft skin. For me; I use the Medicube PDRN PINK Salmon DNA serum, eye cream, milky toner, marshmallow whip facial cleanser, triple collagen cream, pink PDRN exosome micro needling serum and the PINK PDRN moisturizer then the MISSHA vitamin C and snail mucin toner for my face. You can get these from Amazon, I spent about $300 on my skin care products when I bought it for the first time using my intuition to draw me to what would be best for me. You honestly don't have to do that, in my opinion their products are very affordable and you could just get a simple set with the triple collagen cream, zero pore cleanser, PDRN serum, milky toner and the eye cream. Under $100 for all five. I didn't ever have to test another product if I did it was because I wanted to but I was already set with Medicube. Each product ranges from 10-18 dollars but I bought everything I could for added skin perfection. I wish I could show you how gorgeous and perfect my skin is. And I was breakout prone with dull skin and lots of blackheads. The texture is so perfect now. I never use foundation. I have it for if I want a matte finish since my skin is naturally dewy and glowy now, but I literally haven't used it for two years since I started using Korean beauty products. I promise you. Give it a try, you will not regret it. EDIT If you do want to get a good foundation that is super matched to your skin tone and color, try the IL MAKIAGE Foundation. Visit the website to answer a bunch of questions they choose a foundation color based on what you tell them (make sure you know your skin undertones, and skin color they are different) but initially you'll think they won't get it but I promise you they will send you your skin in a bottle. That's my spoil myself foundation, I've tried expensive ones like Christian Dior foundation etc I don't like them nearly as much as I like the Il MAKIAGE. It's the best one that you could use honestly or the Maybelline fit me for convenience they sell that everywhere in stores. Honestly it has great coverage is super affordable and for how cheap it is you get great color matching. They offer so many tones you seem to have warm rosy undertones in your skin tone, so you need a kinda pale foundation with a rosy warm tint, because you have a bit of tan in your undertones as well.","I think you should forgo the foundation altogether, it doesn't match you and actually adds a bit of an aged look because it crinkles your skin too much.

mov_B3EE870ABA56D2615667C319B332715D,"  K-beauty brands are bracing themselves for the possibility of increased U.S. tariffs. Earlier this month, U.S. President Donald Trump began informing America's trading partners about their new duty rates under his tariff regime. First mentioned were Japan and South Korea, which from Aug. 1 will be subject to 25 percent across-the-board duties. More from WWD These changes are poised to impact South Korean beauty exports — which have long entered the U.S. free of duty thanks to the Korea Free Trade Agreement established in 2012 — in a big way. “The tariffs would drive up the cost of goods, which will lead to higher prices for U.S. consumers and contribute to inflation significantly,” said David Chung, founder and chief executive officer of contract manufacturer iLabs, and Morae Packaging, which manufactures in South Korea. “Recovering from these new costs would be extremely difficult not only for the beauty industry but the broader economy.” In recent years, K-beauty has experienced a boon all over again in the U.S. Brands like Beauty of Joseon, TirTir, Medicube, Anua and Mixsoon have risen to virality on TikTok as a new generation of consumers discover the allure of Korean skin care and makeup. Thanks to its viral assortment of SPFs, Beauty of Joseon's sales soared from $31 million in 2020 to more than $100 million in 2023, cofounder Sumin Lee previously told WWD. This month, the brand will make its Sephora debut. Many other next-gen K-beauty brands are breaking into U.S. retail, too: Ulta Beauty announced last week it will add 13 new brands in the category to its own assortment this summer, including Fwee, TirTir, Kaja, Rom&nd and more. Even on TikTok Shop, K-beauty dominates, with Medicube ranking as the number-two brand by sales on the platform in May, netting $4.1 million during the period, per Charm.io. And though U.S. consumers' appetite for K-beauty is in part because of the category's general affordability, increased tariffs threaten to impact that accessibility. “Our key concern is how much prices are going to be raised, and how we can support our customers on this impact — our last choice is raising prices,” said Winnie Zhong, cofounder of New York based Asian beauty retailer Senti Senti, which operates locations in Williamsburg and Chinatown. She added that since Senti Senti is an import business, it will now have to forecast even more inventory, which can be difficult given storage space and rental costs in New York City. Charlotte Cho, founder of e-tailer Soko Glam and skin care brand Then I Met You, said many brands are still treading carefully as they await more certainty on the tariffs front. “It's a bit fresh — brands are not sure of how to react to this potential threat,” she said, adding the tariffs would “negatively impact the K-beauty U.S. market, which is a big focus for Korean brands right now; U.S. retailers or distributors would also be squeezed, or expect the brands to contribute to the tariff tax. In the end, unfortunately it's the customers who will lose as this will just lead to an increase in prices across the board.” Cho added that because many brands ship their packaging and raw materials from parts of Asia, it's not only Asian beauty brands that will be affected by such changes. Nevertheless, Medicube, known for its sculpting Age-R Booster Pro skin care wand and, more recently, its salmon DNA skin care creams and serums, anticipates it may be able to avoid implementing significant price increases. “Most K-beauty products, including Medicube's, have a final retail price around $10 to $20, and due to their relatively low production costs — even when tariffs are applied — these products can remain competitively priced,” said Junehee Nam, U.S. director of media relations of Medicube USA. “With that being said, we do not anticipate that any price increases will be large enough to meaningfully impact consumer demand.” She did say, however, that “we do expect tariff changes to impact corporate profitability…The greatest challenge brands currently face is not the tariff itself, but the uncertainty surrounding it; sudden shifts require brands to redesign profit forecasts, marketing campaigns and global strategies.” Said Joey Chung, director of communications at Sungboon Editor Skincare, known for its overnight sheet masks: “Although higher tariffs could temporarily raise costs, we think that K-beauty's global competitiveness extends well beyond price advantages; it is rooted in continuous product innovation, distinctive and effective formulations, and an exceptional ability to adapt swiftly to emerging beauty trends — all of which contribute significantly to strong consumer trust and loyalty in international markets.” Best of WWD Sign up for WWD's Newsletter.

Urmărește cele mai noi producții video G4Media - articolul continuă mai jos - Aceste schimbări sunt pregătite să afecteze exporturile de produse de frumusețe din Coreea de Sud, care de mult timp intrau în SUA fără taxe datorită Acordului de Liber Schimb dintre Coreea și SUA, încheiat în 2012. „Tarifele ar crește costul bunurilor, ceea ce va duce la prețuri mai mari pentru consumatorii americani și va contribui semnificativ la inflație,” a declarat David Chung, fondator și director executiv al producătorului contract iLabs și Morae Packaging, care produc în Coreea de Sud. „Recuperarea acestor costuri noi va fi extrem de dificilă nu doar pentru industria de frumusețe, ci și pentru economia mai largă.” Branduri precum Beauty of Joseon, TirTir, Medicube, Anua și Mixsoon au devenit virale pe TikTok, pe măsură ce o nouă generație de consumatori descoperă farmecul îngrijirii și machiajului coreean. Datorită gamei virale de produse cu SPF, vânzările Beauty of Joseon au crescut de la 31 de milioane de dolari în 2020 la peste 100 de milioane în 2023, a declarat anterior cofondatoarea Sumin Lee pentru WWD. Multe alte branduri K-beauty de nouă generație pătrund și ele pe piața de retail din SUA: Ulta Beauty a anunțat săptămâna trecută că va adăuga 13 branduri noi în această categorie în propriul sortiment în această vară, inclusiv Fwee, TirTir, Kaja, Rom&nd și altele. Chiar și pe TikTok Shop, K-beauty domină, Medicube clasându-se pe locul doi în topul vânzărilor pe platformă în luna mai, cu venituri de 4,1 milioane de dolari, conform Charm.io. Deși apetitul consumatorilor americani pentru K-beauty se datorează în parte accesibilității generale a acestei categorii, creșterea tarifelor amenință să afecteze această accesibilitate. „Preocuparea noastră principală este cât de mult vor crește prețurile și cum putem sprijini clienții față de acest impact — ultima noastră opțiune este să majorăm prețurile,” a spus Winnie Zhong, cofondatoare a retailerului newyorkez de frumusețe asiatică Senti Senti, care operează locații în Williamsburg și Chinatown. Ea a adăugat că, fiind o afacere de import, Senti Senti va trebui acum să estimeze un stoc chiar mai mare, ceea ce poate fi dificil având în vedere spațiul de depozitare și costurile de chirie din New York. Charlotte Cho, fondatoarea retailerului online Soko Glam și a brandului de îngrijire a pielii Then I Met You, a spus că multe branduri rămân prudente în timp ce așteaptă mai multă claritate privind tarifele. „Este încă un subiect nou, brandurile nu sunt sigure cum să reacționeze la această potențială amenințare,” a spus ea, adăugând că tarifele „vor avea un impact negativ asupra pieței K-beauty din SUA, care este un punct important pentru brandurile coreene în prezent; retailerii sau distribuitorii americani vor fi de asemenea presați sau se vor aștepta ca brandurile să contribuie la taxa vamală. În final, din păcate, clienții vor pierde, deoarece asta va duce doar la creșterea generală a prețurilor.” Cho a mai spus că, deoarece multe branduri trimit ambalajele și materiile prime din diverse părți ale Asiei, nu doar brandurile de frumusețe asiatice vor fi afectate de astfel de schimbări. Totuși, Medicube, cunoscut pentru aplicatorul său de îngrijire a pielii Age-R Booster Pro și, mai recent, pentru cremele și serurile cu ADN de somon, anticipează că ar putea evita majorările semnificative de preț. „Majoritatea produselor K-beauty, inclusiv cele Medicube, au un preț final de retail în jur de 10 până la 20 de dolari, iar datorită costurilor relativ scăzute de producție, chiar și cu aplicarea tarifelor, aceste produse pot rămâne competitive ca preț,” a spus Junehee Nam, directorul relațiilor media al Medicube USA. „Cu toate acestea, nu anticipăm ca majorările de preț să fie atât de mari încât să afecteze în mod semnificativ cererea consumatorilor.” Ea a menționat totuși că „așteptăm ca schimbările tarifare să afecteze profitabilitatea companiilor… Cea mai mare provocare cu care se confruntă brandurile în prezent nu este tariful în sine, ci incertitudinea care îl înconjoară; schimbările bruște obligă brandurile să-și refacă previziunile de profit, campaniile de marketing și strategiile globale.” Joey Chung, directorul de comunicare al Sungboon Editor Skincare, cunoscut pentru măștile sale de noapte, a declarat: „Deși tarifele mai mari ar putea crește temporar costurile, credem că competitivitatea globală a K-beauty merge mult dincolo de avantajele legate de preț; se bazează pe inovația continuă a produselor, formule distinctive și eficiente și o capacitate excepțională de adaptare rapidă la tendințele emergente în frumusețe toate acestea contribuind semnificativ la încrederea și loialitatea puternică a consumatorilor pe piețele internaționale.”","SPR_COMBO[ro]Dimensiune text Dimensiune text La începutul acestei luni, președintele SUA, Donald Trump, a început să informeze partenerii comerciali ai Americii despre noile rate vamale în cadrul regimului său tarifar.

I'm suspecting the culprit is the Anua heartleaf oil cleanser which I've only used 3 times and immediately stopped when I started to notice my forehead getting worse then what it already was. My routine AM & PM about 2/3 months ago was simply: •Water or Geek & Gorgeous Jelly Joker Cleanser • Rose Water • Pyunkang Yul Calming Moisture Barrier Cream My skin during this time of course wasn't flawless but the best it's ever been. I've run out of the moisturiser, just topped up on rose water (I haven't really used it since this routine), and I'm scraping out what's left of my cleanser. My current routine AM & PM: •Water or Geek & Gorgeous Jelly Joker Cleanser • Rose Water ( picked up using it again) • Vanicream moisturising lotion I plan to buy the Pyunkang moisturiser again for mainly PM and Bioderma intensive gel creme for AM just to help with that oil control especially since I'm travelling to a hot climate. Also I've brought revitale salicylic & sulphur bar soap off of amazon to use only on my forehead to help, no way will I use it on the rest of my face it'll end up being burned off Sooo my new routine will look something like: AM: • Water or Geek & Gorgeous Jelly Joker Cleanser • Rose Water • Bioderma gel creme PM: • salicylic & sulphur bar ( 1/2 a week) • Rose water • Pyunkang Yul Calming Moisture Barrier Cream Sorry for the lengthy post!!

mov_81A7C5F4F0FD8E3F138087124FD3B87E,"  I, however, would never gatekeep this game-changing skin magic from you. 1. Medicube's ""Zero Pore"" Pads that do their job so well, they turned this skeptical reviewer into a believer. They contain lactic acid, salicylic acid, and a dual-textured surface to help control excess sebum while exfoliating dead skin and refining pores, all while keeping you looking like a true ~glow-getter~. Promising review: ""I kept seeing this product on social media and finally decided to give it a try. I use this twice daily, and it's been a couple of weeks, and I definitely noticed my pores have shrunk. I even apply it to my neck and chest area. Product is soothing, gentle on my skin (have extremely sensitive skin), no strong smell, cottons are soft, and did not cause any breakouts! It's great for the value, and I'll definitely be repurchasing these."" —Ee El Get a pack of 70 from Amazon for $18.90 (available in four other styles). 2. If your skin is more on the sensitive side, a jar of Anua daily toner pads — the superhero ingredient is heartleaf extract, which helps to soothe and hydrate skin while leaving you with a glowy complexion. The formula's PHA gently exfoliates and removes dead skin cells while also helping to reduce blackheads, whiteheads, and breakouts. Just take this reviewer's word — they say they've tested hundreds of skincare products and this is the *only* time they've ever been able to achieve clear skin without medicine. Promising reviews: ""This has been THEEE best product for my dry, sensitive skin. These pads are brightening and helped my uneven skin texture. I didn't know these pads would change my skin completely!! I'll be repurchasing forever, best skincare product I've used in a long time, you NEED THIS! You'll immediately notice a difference."" —Kenny Vasquez ""When I tell you my skin hasn't been this clear in forever. I have PCOS and hirsutism, which causes me to grow hair on my neck and chin. I'm also a skin picker so clearing my skin has been really difficult for me. But this product has saved my skin. I'm still working on my skin picking but when I don't, these pads help to exfoliate and help with the dark marks. Thank Anua!"" —Jessyca Renee Get it from Amazon for $21.95. 3. A hydrating Yerba Mate Wake Up eye gel, which is like treating your face to a morning espresso shot. It uses the power of yerba mate, caffeine, and peptides to soothe the delicate skin under your eyes, and also contains three forms of hyaluronic acid to moisturize your skin. And here I was thinking there was only one type of hyaluronic acid — the more ya know! See it in action on TikTok. Promising reviews: ""This is the BEST eye/whole face everything I've ever tried!!! It may take a day or two to see results, but when you do it is so worth it!! I started with my eyes. . ZERO irritation, morning and night. Then I thought well. . how about here. . my cheeks, jawline, everywhere on my face. It shows me that it wasn't just my under-eye puffiness, dark circles... it was my whole face!! This is the best I have ever tried! For me, this is a staple FOREVER!!!
