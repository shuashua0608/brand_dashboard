I am scrubbing immediately 2. Very underwhelming, probably would not purchase OR scrubbed but would give a second chance 3. Somewhat enjoyable, didn't scrub, could maybe try this again in the future 4. I am probably going to size up from the sample size, I enjoyed this 5. I love it, full size full size full size **Moon Bathing-** *""Lychee fruit, milk, vanilla, jasmine grandiflorum, salt""* Woah. The freshness/tart of the lychee balances the laconic of the milk and sweetness of the vanilla perfectly. This is a fruity gourmand in the best way possible. The light pink is gorgeous, this song smells like Pink in the Night by Mitski if you've ever heard it. I do not smell the salt but maybe it's just what's contributing to the ‚Äútart‚Äù of the lychee which I adore. As time progresses you can kind of get that floral in the background too. Which I would usually say I could do without but here it builds a solid base. Vibes are definitely light, delicate, fem, fruity, youthful but reserved, clean 4.5/5 **Parakeet-** *""Fizzy grapefruit soda, freshly picked daisies, tiny forget-me-nots, and the powdery sweet down feathers of a well groomed parakeet""* Omg why am I slowly coming to realize I love tart?! This smells like a Sweetart/tart candy to me. I think it's the grapefruit that does this. It's very beautiful and summer ish! This is what I would imagine that very pricey Odette fragrance with the swan on it smells like. However, I really do wish the dry down was as effervescent and pretty as the opening. You do still get hits of that grapefruit throughout, but it does become floral dominant and lose some of that fizzy soda aspect (which it does indeed capture perfectly). I feel very split on this only because I think the daisy note isn't for me but I would honestly recommend this to anyone who wants a fizzy grapefruit citrus soda flowery vibe. Of note: My boyfriend, who has to be the pickiest person on earth (maybe I only say this because I subject him to bakery level gourmands which he is not a fan of) LOVES THIS. 3/5 **Alibi-** *""Passionfruit, orange blossom, guava, strawberry yuzu lemonade, and a dash of coconut cream over a rosewood base""* More tart! But this means full tropical and it is beautiful. It is sexy, fruity, tropical, tart, and unapologetic. This immediately transports me to Maui. The coconut keeps it balanced, you can get a dash of it throughout. Personally it leans too fruity and juicy for me. Like you really do smell like a mix of red fruits. I do get the name though, you smell so delicious it's almost too good to be true. This is a great fragrance for sure but it is just not for me personally. 3/5 **A Dog Named Pam-** *""Juniper berry, petitgrain, bitter orange, red mandarin, cedarwood, palo santo, and a warm fuzzy musk that feels to me like the hot belly of a clean dog""* This is what I think Nami from One Piece would smell like.

July 15, 2025, 1:05am Macy's may be holding on to its longtime position as the top U.S. retailer by share of fragrance sales, but plenty of other shifts are afoot when it comes to who's winning the category. According to YipitData, Macy's accounted for 31.8 percent of fragrance sales during the month of May, indicating a 14.7-point lead from the category's next-biggest retailer during the period, Ulta Beauty. While significant, that lead is several points less than it was, say, two years prior in 2023, when Macy's accounted for more than 40 percent of fragrance sales during the same month. This shift is in part due to the nascent growth of alternative fragrance retailers as formidable competitors in the space. There's Amazon, which, per YipitData, accounted for 14.9 percent of fragrance sales in May across the platform's first- and third-party sellers (tracking after Sephora, which accounted for 15.5 percent during the same period). TikTok Shop, too, wasn't on the map at all in the U.S. until halfway through 2023, yet today the e-tailer ‚Äî which has propelled brands from Lattafa to Phlur to virality ‚Äî goes head-to-head with Target in terms of share of fragrance sales, actually outpacing Target slightly in May.

For the month of May, Valentino overtook YSL for the number-three spot, while in April, Chanel's Chance Eau Splendide Eau de Parfum was the retailer's top-selling new stock keeping unit across the store.

1m2jnsk,"‚Äâ I recently bought Kayali YBM and wanted to find more gourmand scents on a budget. So, I went on a rampage buying the highest rated, budget friendly fragrances on Amazon. Unfortunately I do not like any of them except for Sweet Tooth by Sabrina Carpenter. It's a very light, clean scent, but doesn't last. The Bellavita Senorita is a stronger version of Versace Bright Crystal which I already own and don't particularly care for. If you like that scent, then that one is definitely worth buying. The rest of them smell like a substitute teacher from the 90's. Very powdery and overpowering. Also, none are reminiscent of any gourmand scent I've tried. A disappointing hall to say the least. Don't make the same mistake I did.
