UgzrfYmcciLo4GqB9vt4AaABAg,"  After prime day sales week, I realized that a lot of the stuff I had in my cart is ""great"" to have (books, bras, affordable skincare) but I should really wait until next sale (maybe november or even next year's prime sale). I instead invested in some of the things that are more so a necessity (like my dentist wants me to use an electric toothbrush so I finally made the switch when it was 50% off) and that I'll be able to use long term + feel good about it. My probiotics that I already take were also on sale so I was able to skip next months shipment and save 10 dollars in that department. You really taught me what financial health means and how I can be so much more mindful about what ""saving money"" actually means as a consumer. I didn't know that I was actually spending more in order to get the complimentary ""gift card"" or fulfill the requirement for the sale but in actuality, I'm spending more on things that I'll just hoard and never use. It felt so good to give away some of the stuff I've been hoarding and to focus on using up the products I already opened. I think now it matters more to just be consistent with the products I currently have and it will still fulfill the same benefit I would've gotten if not better than from a new fancier product (for example the cheaper body lotions and body washes). I'm of course not perfect when it comes to lip products because I'm a sucker for 5$ glosses or lip oils but I'm teaching myself that I'm maxed out and don't need anymore lip products. PS last year I was really impressed from testing out the Necessaire body lotion at sephora. I remember it felt so luxurious putting it on my hand but now that I'm almost done with the 13.5 oz bottle, it really didnt make that much of a difference compared to my other body lotions . It was still nice and beneficial to use but not worth the 40 bucks at all","After prime day sales week, I realized that a lot of the stuff I had in my cart is ""great"" to have (books, bras, affordable skincare) but I should really wait until next sale (maybe november or even next year's prime sale).

18073213318955734,"  Scent of the Day: lelabofragrances - Eucalyptus 20 layered on top of necessaire body wash and lotion (Olibanum/Frankincense fragrance). Eucalyptus 20 Fragrance Notes: Top - Eucalyptus, Cedarwood Middle - Labdanum Bottom - Musk, Frankincense My experience with this combo actually began with trying the Necessaire deodorant in Olibanum. It works so well, and I immediately went crazy over the fragrance. After sampling the body lotion at Sephora, I knew this line was one day going to become one of my regular rotations. This is a Frankincense-based fragrance beautifully blended with vanilla, fig leaf, and cassis buds. As a lover of fig fragrances, this is a great base for layering. It's woody, warm, and slightly sweet. I took advantage of the Amazon Prime Day sale and got these highly discounted. After hearing oliviaolfactory review Eucalyptus 20 a while back, it sounded like a must-sample. While I never did get to initially sample the fragrance, this perfect little discovery set was available for the nordstrom Anniversary Sale, allowing me to also enjoy Santal 33 and Another 13 (thanks Mom for the birthday gift card!) . Oddly enough, eucalyptus isn't the star of the show, more like a supporting role. It's a fresh eucalyptus and not medicinal in the least. The combination of frankincense and cedarwood create a deeply grounding aroma that evokes memories of incense at a midnight Catholic mass during childhood. Have you tried any of these products? If so, please let me know what you think in the comments. #lelabo #nécessaire #fragrance #nordstrom #sephora","Scent of the Day: lelabofragrances - Eucalyptus 20 layered on top of necessaire body wash and lotion (Olibanum/Frankincense fragrance).
