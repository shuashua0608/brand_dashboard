When styling my hair they used TWO diffusers on my head with VERY high heat and no protectent for probably 10-20 minutes maybe even longer. I felt like my scalp and face was melting off during this, not to mention the curl styling they left me with was very artificial curls. My hair felt so bad after this idk how to describe it as it'd my first time feeling the texture but it was very coarse feeling and not at all the silky smooth hair I normally enjoy. I did recently change my hair products too around the same time just cause I ran out of my old product and wanted to try something new that would benefit my hair and at first thought it might be the new product but the more I think about that experience the weirder it sounds in my head. The products I currently use is the matrix a curl can dream shampoo and conditioner, goldwell curl cream with the addition of the wow dream coat for curly hair spray. The shampoo and curl cream are new previously used the redken mega curl line which i did like but it was a little costly over time. I haven't changed my routine either but its not a very stable one, brush my hair while in the shower while washing scrunch it to get rid of excess water and then put some products in. I normally air dry due to not having alot of time before I need to leave when I have extra time I will diffuse but low heat and low speed with protectent in my hair. This normally gives my hair an extra oummff but when I tried to diffuse today it just didnt even want to curl! The first photo was my hair before the cut/style from the hair salon only with redken shampoo and the wow curl spray applied and left to air dry. The second photo was taken today after a full wash shampoo and conditioner curl cream and spray plus diffused! I'm really not sure if maybe I'm just not doing something right but the last wash i did after the experience was left to air dry and had similar results with little to NO curls. I really feel like the only parts that curl now are the strands around my face that didnt get attacked by the two diffusers. Not seeing my hair automatically curl around itself after brushing it was really a kick in a gut and a realisation that they may have screwed me over. Im fairly new to my hair journey and I'm scared and stressed that I have to restart and spend alot of money trying to fix this!!

The newlyweds exchanged vows at St Paul's Cathedral in London today, with Mel, 50, having announced her engagement to the hairdresser in October 2022. Celebrity faces were spotted arriving at the ceremony this afternoon, with those on the guest list including former bandmate Emma Bunton, known as Baby Spice, who attended with her partner, Jade Jones, and son, Beau. Other famous pals donning their finery for the grand occasion included Katherine Ryan, Alan Carr, Angellica Bell, Daisy Lowe, Cara Delevingne, and Gaby Roslin. Noticeably absent were Spice Girls Victoria Beckham and Mel C, but VB's parents, Tony and Jackie Adams, were present. The fashion designer also reached out to Mel ahead of the wedding with a sweet social media post. Ahead of the wedding, Scary Spice Mel worked closely with Evelie Bridal and Josephine Scott to design her luxury georgette crepe gown. Of course, all eyes were on her show-stopping dress as Mel arrived at the cathedral, and upon her exit, new husband on her arm as they climbed into a horse-drawn carriage to make their getaway, royal wedding-style. Caroline Black, owner of Evelie Bridal, told the PA news agency: 'For her look at St Paul's Cathedral, Melanie B wanted a bespoke gown that embodies strength, sensuality, and timeless glamour.' The dress has been described by Caroline as a 'luxury georgette crepe gown with a sculpted corset bodice', featuring 'intricate draping that hugs the silhouette and flows into a dramatic, sweeping train'. It also had a 'sheer illusion detachable jacket, hand-embellished with pearl constellations,' which has been described as creating a high-neck, long-sleeve effect that framed the singer's shoulders and added 'ethereal elegance to complement the ceremony and honour St Paul's etiquette'. Mel also wore a cathedral-length veil, which was embroidered with scattered pearls to complete the look. Speaking about the process of styling the Wannabe hitmaker for her wedding day, Caroline hailed it as 'an honour' and 'nothing short of extraordinary'. She said: 'Helping a real Spice Girl choose her wedding dress‚Äîwhat could possibly top that? 'But what's truly made this experience so meaningful is getting to know Mel as just Mel, not the icon, but the woman.' Josephine added: 'Designing this gown for Mel was about capturing her fearless spirit and softness all in one look. 'She's iconic, powerful, and radiant‚Äîand this dress had to be worthy of that. 'Every detail was chosen to honour her strength and sensuality while celebrating the woman and the love story beneath the girl power.' Mel was previously married to Stephen Belafonte until she filed for divorce in 2017 following allegations of abuse. They have a daughter, Madison Brown Belafonte. Mel B also has two daughters, Phoenix Chi Gulzar and Angel Iris Murphy Brown, from two previous relationships. Who is Mel B's husband, Rory McPhee? Rory is¬†a celebrity hairstylist said to be a specialist when it comes to curly styles. He's previously worked with fellow stylist Lee Stafford and for major brand Redken, which is part of the L'Oreal group. Mel and Rory didn't get together romantically until 2018, despite knowing each other for years before. It's believed he was a family friend of Mel's cousin, having gone to school with Christian Cooke. Rory's hairdressing expertise is believed to have helped him in wooing Mel, as the star chopped her famous curls off after her previous relationship ended. While Rory began 'nurturing' her locks, she praised him for doing the same to her 'belief in love again and trust'. Got a story?

For the beauty fans who are keen to take advantage of the Amazon deal, but aren't sure if the Bonding Treatment is right for them, I have provided below my full thoughts on when I first trialled it last year. ""Despite what you might think, I didn't run into this review with high expectations. I have used Olaplex in the past, which has helped the condition of my hair, but other products on the market don't tend to work well. Trust me, I have tried a lot. ""So, when I brought the Redken Leave-In Treatment on Amazon Prime Day, alongside the Pre-Shampoo Treatment, I decided to try and keep a level head. There's nothing worse than being disappointed, am I right? ""That being said, when I first popped this treatment on my damp ends, my first thought was that it seemed quite heavy, and I worried it would make my hair greasy. I couldn't have been more wrong, because like many reviews mentioned, a little goes a long way. ""I only needed just larger than a pea size amount to coat my lengths and ends evenly, and it melted in without weighing my fine hair down, unlike many other leave-in conditioners."" ""Considering many reviews and videos on TikTok say this treatment left their hair ""visibly healthier"" immediately, I was genuinely surprised to find myself agreeing with them. ""The first time I used the leave-in treatment, I used it alongside the pre-shampoo treatment and my hair felt smoother, with less tangles for my comb to snarl through. As soon as I blow dried my hair with the treatment in, I could notice that the broken, damaged ends of my hair were visibly smoother and a little shinier as well. ""Long gone were the gnarled looking straggly ends, and in their place was smooth, shiny hair that looked as though it had never been touched by any damage. Honestly, as someone who struggles with her fine hair, I was immediately surprised at the magic. ""After using the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment during my hair wash days in the week, I noticed that my hair doesn't look as damaged. ""Even though I've used it a few times now, the bottle still feels full, which is insane value for money. Considering my thin hair can go through products like crazy due to its weaker nature, I think that this treatment will be a staple that will save me cash in the long run. ""It's not just saving me money, as my hair genuinely feels softer and less fragile since I began using it. While it's no replacement for a good salon visit to cut off the dead ends, it's certainly a miracle worker in between appointments that has helped save my over processed hair to look, leaving it in much better condition.""

From game-changing skincare innovation to viral makeup launches and pro-approved hair tools, my dressing table is a constantly revolving display of the latest and greatest in beauty. And yet, even with access to new products every day, I have curated a selection of staples I return to time and time again that deliver without fail. I used to have to traipse around sourcing them from various high street shops and ordering from different websites, but with Amazon's recent expansion into premium beauty, many of them are available online with next day delivery‚Äîand now, some of them are part of the latest Prime Day offerings. With so many deals flying around, so I wanted to share my absolute beauty must-buys to streamline your shopping list. From the self-tan mist that doesn't require any blending, to the multi-tasking hair hero I've been using for years, these are the products I trust and love enough to use on repeat. And yes, I will be buying multiples. Whether you want to stock up on products that you can be sure are worth your money, or are looking to test out something new (without the full-price commitment), these picks are where I'd suggest you start this Prime Day. The Best Prime Day Beauty Picks St.tropez Self Tan Purity Face Mist I have tried every face self tan, but return to this one every time. The ultra fine mist means that there's no blending required. None. And it's streak-free and flawless every time. Plus, it dries instantly and doesn't stain my pillow case. It's become a staple in my product roundup‚ÄîI'm seldom without a bottle (or two!) . Shark Smoothstyle Heated Brush and Comb I love Shark for their powerful tools that make day-to-day styling easier, but I'm particularly a fan of their wet-to-dry hair styling solutions, including their SmoothStyle Brush and Comb. When on wet mode, it doesn't reach hair-damaging temperatures, and the can seamlessly be switched to dry mode to ensure lasting style. In other words it's time-saving, space-saving and hair-saving. Redken One United 25 Multi-Benefits Leave-In Conditioner and Treatment Spray This product may be the gold standard when it comes to multitasking. It delivers a whopping 25 hair benefits in one, from detangling and conditioning, to heat protection and frizz control. Plus, it will make your hair smell fresh from the salon. Elemis Pro-Collagen Marine Oil This is the perfect choice for anyone who says they don't 'do' facial oils. It's super lightweight and packed with marine actives including Padina Pavonica, Golden Seaweed and Roaring Water Kelp for instant skin plumping and lasting hydration. I love to use it for a lymphatic drainage massage along with a Gua Sha or facial roller. Sacheu Lip Liner Stay-N Peel Off Lip Stain I always think it's optimal to try a trending product at a discount in case it's not worth the hype‚Äîso if you haven't tried the viral Sacheu Lip Liner, now is your chance. Having said that, this product is worth the hype if you like long-lasting lip products in a range of colours, including Billie Eilish's favourite shade Noo-hed, although I tend to use it as an all-over tint rather than a liner (the applicator is quite wide and doesn't allow you to draw a fine lip line). St.tropez Self Tan Express Mousse While I love a leave-on self-tan mist for my face, I've never been able to master full body self-tans unless they have a guide colour, they dry instantly, and I can wash them off after a few hours. Enter express tanning mousses, i.e. the only self-tan format I can cope with where my body is concerned. This one has a guide colour to ensure zero streaks, and it develops in as little as one hour, after which time you can wash it off and basque in your golden glow. Byoma Milky Moisture Cleanser Milky skincare is having a moment‚Äîand for good reason. Originally from Korea (as so many great beauty innovations are), milky skincare includes formulas that are supremely lightweight, hydrating and gentle on the skin. Byoma's hero Miky Cleanser not only boasts all the aforementioned, but also a Tri Ceramide Complex (ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids) to dissolve daily build up including SPF, oil and makeup while ensuring skin feels soft ‚Äì never stripped. It's a must-have for sensitive, redness-prone skin. CeraVe SA Smoothing Cleanser CeraVe has long been a beauty editor favourite when it comes to their range of cleansers, and their Salicyclic Acid cleanser is ideal for anyone who struggles with breakouts or congested pores. While the salicyclic acid exfoliates and regulates sebum, hyaluronic acid and ceramides support the skin barrier and boost moisture. Schwarzkopf Schwarzkopf Eyebrow Tint While I'm a natural brunette, my eyebrows missed the memo and have always been a very pale shade of mousey. I rely on at-home tints to save me having to draw my eyebrows on every morning, and to save me the hassle of going to a salon every week to have them dyed professionally. Of all the at-home tints, this one offers a rich colour and lasts the longest....","Beauty that's worth buying As a beauty journalist, I've had the opportunity to try thousands of products over the years.

Redken One United 25 Multi-Benefits Leave-In Conditioner and Treatment Spray This product may be the gold standard when it comes to multitasking. It delivers a whopping 25 hair benefits in one, from detangling and conditioning, to heat protection and frizz control. Plus, it will make your hair smell fresh from the salon. Elemis Pro-Collagen Marine Oil This is the perfect choice for anyone who says they don't 'do' facial oils. It's super lightweight and packed with marine actives including Padina Pavonica, Golden Seaweed and Roaring Water Kelp for instant skin plumping and lasting hydration. I love to use it for a lymphatic drainage massage along with a Gua Sha or facial roller. Sacheu Lip Liner Stay-N Peel Off Lip Stain I always think it's optimal to try a trending product at a discount in case it's not worth the hype‚Äîso if you haven't tried the viral Sacheu Lip Liner, now is your chance. Having said that, this product is worth the hype if you like long-lasting lip products in a range of colours, including Billie Eilish's favourite shade Noo-hed, although I tend to use it as an all-over tint rather than a liner (the applicator is quite wide and doesn't allow you to draw a fine lip line). St.tropez Self Tan Express Mousse While I love a leave-on self-tan mist for my face, I've never been able to master full body self-tans unless they have a guide colour, they dry instantly, and I can wash them off after a few hours. Enter express tanning mousses, i.e. the only self-tan format I can cope with where my body is concerned. This one has a guide colour to ensure zero streaks, and it develops in as little as one hour, after which time you can wash it off and basque in your golden glow. Byoma Milky Moisture Cleanser Milky skincare is having a moment‚Äîand for good reason. Originally from Korea (as so many great beauty innovations are), milky skincare includes formulas that are supremely lightweight, hydrating and gentle on the skin. Byoma's hero Miky Cleanser not only boasts all the aforementioned, but also a Tri Ceramide Complex (ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids) to dissolve daily build up including SPF, oil and makeup while ensuring skin feels soft ‚Äì never stripped. It's a must-have for sensitive, redness-prone skin. CeraVe SA Smoothing Cleanser CeraVe has long been a beauty editor favourite when it comes to their range of cleansers, and their Salicyclic Acid cleanser is ideal for anyone who struggles with breakouts or congested pores. While the salicyclic acid exfoliates and regulates sebum, hyaluronic acid and ceramides support the skin barrier and boost moisture. Schwarzkopf Schwarzkopf Eyebrow Tint While I'm a natural brunette, my eyebrows missed the memo and have always been a very pale shade of mousey. I rely on at-home tints to save me having to draw my eyebrows on every morning, and to save me the hassle of going to a salon every week to have them dyed professionally. Of all the at-home tints, this one offers a rich colour and lasts the longest....",2025-07-09 06:00:00,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The comment specifically mentions and positively reviews the Redken One United 25 Multi-Benefits Leave-In Conditioner and Treatment Spray, describing it as a ""gold standard"" multitasking product with 25 hair benefits.

EAF08F5EC939AAFE9B96F88DE3FB95CB,"‚Äâ MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage (I charge from ¬£1,150 for mine). Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 (¬£19.55, www.amazon.co.uk), Olaplex No.8 (¬£22.40, www.sephora.co.uk) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer (¬£21, www.boots.com). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner (¬£27, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner (¬£26, www.harrods.com). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now ¬£17.99, sha op.toni www.ndguy.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now ¬£12, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo (¬£24.50, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment (¬£25). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

397059B84031EE2F45D751CA8833E1A2,"‚Äâ by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage. Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 ((EURO)29.50, www.brownthomas.com), Olaplex No.8 ((EURO)29.50, www.arnotts.ie) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer ((EURO)24.45, www.lookfantastic.ie). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner ((EURO)31, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner ((EURO)30, www.boots.ie). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now (EURO)22.49, www.cloud10beauty.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now (EURO)14, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo ((EURO)28.20, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment ((EURO)28). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage. Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 ((EURO)29.50, www.brownthomas.com), Olaplex No.8 ((EURO)29.50, www.arnotts.ie) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer ((EURO)24.45, www.lookfantastic.ie). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner ((EURO)31, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner ((EURO)30, www.boots.ie). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now (EURO)22.49, www.cloud10beauty.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now (EURO)14, www.sephora.co.uk). 5.

A trav√©s de su cuenta de X (antes Twitter), cont√≥ con humor que hab√≠a estado hospitalizada por una hernia causada por usar pantalones extremadamente ajustados. ‚Äú'Suki, ya no tuiteas'... ¬øSab√≠as que hace seis meses us√© unos pantalones tan apretados que me causaron una hernia y tuve demasiado miedo de dec√≠rtelo?‚Äù , escribi√≥ junto a una fotograf√≠a suya desde la cama del hospital y otra sobre el escenario, donde luce los infames pantalones verdes que habr√≠an sido los culpables. El contraste de las im√°genes caus√≥ furor. Mira: Muere cantante argentina a los 36 a√±os que padec√≠a c√°ncer; ¬°afirmaba curarse con la m√∫sica! ¬øQu√© es una hernia y c√≥mo puede causarla la ropa apretada? Aunque suene como algo que solo pasa en Hollywood, el caso de la cantante britanica Suki puso bajo los reflectores un tema poco discutido: los efectos de la ropa ajustada en la salud. Una hernia ocurre cuando parte del intestino o tejido sobresale a trav√©s de un punto d√©bil en los m√∫sculos abdominales, y aunque no es com√∫n que la ropa apretada lo cause directamente, s√≠ puede agravar una condici√≥n preexistente. La Cl√≠nica Mayo se√±ala que la presi√≥n constante sobre la zona abdominal, como la ejercida por jeans ce√±idos o cinturones muy ajustados, podr√≠a complicar cuadros m√©dicos latentes o impedir una correcta presi√≥n intraabdominal. En casos extremos, como el de Suki, la est√©tica puede terminar pasando una factura bastante alta.

La revelaci√≥n no solo sorprendi√≥ por lo peculiar del motivo, sino por la manera en que Waterhouse lo comparti√≥.

Ambos est√°n juntos desde 2018 y en 2024 le dieron la bienvenida a su primera hija.","SPR_COMBO[es]Suki Waterhouse, actriz, cantante y pareja del actor Robert Pattinson, rompi√≥ el silencio sobre su reciente desaparici√≥n de redes sociales... ¬°y lo hizo con mucho estilo! A trav√©s de su cuenta de X (antes Twitter), cont√≥ con humor que hab√≠a estado hospitalizada por una hernia causada por usar pantalones extremadamente ajustados. ‚Äú'Suki, ya no tuiteas'... ¬øSab√≠as que hace seis meses us√© unos pantalones tan apretados que me causaron una hernia y tuve demasiado miedo de dec√≠rtelo?‚Äù , escribi√≥ junto a una fotograf√≠a suya desde la cama del hospital y otra sobre el escenario, donde luce los infames pantalones verdes que habr√≠an sido los culpables. El contraste de las im√°genes caus√≥ furor. Mira: Muere cantante argentina a los 36 a√±os que padec√≠a c√°ncer; ¬°afirmaba curarse con la m√∫sica! ¬øQu√© es una hernia y c√≥mo puede causarla la ropa apretada? Aunque suene como algo que solo pasa en Hollywood, el caso de la cantante britanica Suki puso bajo los reflectores un tema poco discutido: los efectos de la ropa ajustada en la salud. Una hernia ocurre cuando parte del intestino o tejido sobresale a trav√©s de un punto d√©bil en los m√∫sculos abdominales, y aunque no es com√∫n que la ropa apretada lo cause directamente, s√≠ puede agravar una condici√≥n preexistente. La Cl√≠nica Mayo se√±ala que la presi√≥n constante sobre la zona abdominal, como la ejercida por jeans ce√±idos o cinturones muy ajustados, podr√≠a complicar cuadros m√©dicos latentes o impedir una correcta presi√≥n intraabdominal. En casos extremos, como el de Suki, la est√©tica puede terminar pasando una factura bastante alta.
