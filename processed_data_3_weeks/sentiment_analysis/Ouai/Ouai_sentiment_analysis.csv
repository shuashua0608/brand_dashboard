1c290000133046f218a07e54573bb10d,"  L'Oréal's Color Wow Acquisition: A Bold Move in the Premium Haircare Race L'Oréal's June 2025 acquisition of Color Wow marks a pivotal moment in the beauty industry's push toward premiumization and consolidation. By securing a brand synonymous with salon-quality haircare, L'Oréal aims to fortify its position in a high-margin segment primed for growth. This move not only underscores the French giant's strategic agility but also signals escalating competition in the premium haircare market—a space where niche players once thrived unchallenged. Why the Premium Haircare Market Matters The global haircare market is projected to exceed $60 billion by 2028, with premium products capturing the fastest growth. Consumers, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are increasingly willing to pay a premium for science-backed, efficacy-driven products that deliver visible results. Color Wow's reputation as a “stylist's favorite” aligns perfectly with this trend, offering L'Oréal access to a loyal customer base and a portfolio of award-winning formulas like its Root Cover Up Powder and Dream Coat spray. Strategic Rationale: A Triple Win for L'Oréal Premium Segment Dominance: Color Wow's $300 million revenue (doubling in three years) and 40–60% profit margins highlight the profitability of premium haircare. L'Oréal's Professional Products Division, which generated €4.89 billion in 2024, now gains a foothold in styling and color correction—categories with double-digit growth rates.Omnichannel Synergy: Color Wow's hybrid distribution model (salons, Sephora, Amazon) complements L'Oréal's global retail network. By expanding Color Wow's presence in Asia and Europe, L'Oréal can capitalize on untapped markets where premium haircare demand is soaring.R&D & Innovation Boost: L'Oréal's $1.5 billion annual R&D investment can accelerate Color Wow's pipeline, while cost efficiencies from shared supply chains could improve margins further. Valuation: Paying a Premium for Growth While the exact purchase price remains undisclosed, industry sources suggest a valuation near $1 billion, implying a 25–30x EV/EBITDA multiple (Color Wow's EBITDA is estimated at $33–40 million). This aligns with L'Oréal's own 18.9x EV/EBITDA multiple, which is elevated compared to the broader CPG sector but justified by its scale and innovation. Risks and Competing Forces - Niche Brand Threats: Smaller players like IGK Hair or Ouai, which emphasize affordability and social media-savvy branding, could erode L'Oréal's premium positioning unless it maintains its innovation edge. - Sustainability Pressure: Rising demand for eco-friendly products (e.g., Unilever's Wild brand) forces L'Oréal to balance premium pricing with green initiatives. - Market Saturation: Over-indexing on premium haircare could backfire if demand softens in mature markets like North America, where tariffs already pressured sales in 2024. Investment Takeaways: Buy, Hold, or Wait? L'Oréal's stock trades at €372.60, well above analysts' fair value estimates of €208.78–€236.69. While this suggests near-term overvaluation, the Color Wow deal reinforces its long-term moat in premium beauty. Key considerations: - Upside Catalysts: Continued growth in SAPMENA-SSA (South Asia, Africa) and successful integration of Color Wow's brand identity. - Downside Risks: Margin pressure from tariffs, slower-than-expected premium segment adoption, or a shift toward budget-friendly alternatives. Final Recommendation Hold for the Long Term, but Be Selective Near-Term: L'Oréal's fundamentals—diversified revenue streams, geographic reach, and financial discipline—support its valuation. However, investors should wait for a pullback to the €200–€250 range before accumulating shares. Monitor Q2 earnings for signs of margin recovery and Color Wow's contribution to sales. For aggressive investors, consider a partial allocation now, hedged against sector volatility. In a beauty market increasingly defined by premiumization and consolidation, L'Oréal's move on Color Wow is a masterstroke—unless the next disruptor outpaces them in sustainability or affordability. The jury's still out, but L'Oréal's track record of turning niche brands into global juggernauts suggests this bet will pay off. Data as of June 2025. Always consult a financial advisor before making investment decisions.

mov_A603EABFB6D36858A12EA2522C4A5DDD,"  I've dabbled in an array of hair growth solutions, including topical foams and oils to ingestible supplements. As someone who is constantly time-pressed—and, frankly, forgetful—however, I've struggled to maintain the necessary consistency to see results. The sole exception? Hair growth shampoo, which offers a streamlined, straightforward alternative to the aforementioned options. I've tried many—yet few have thickened my straggly strands like the Rosemary Shampoo from my favorite bodycare brand, Nécessiare. I'm stocking up while it's on rare sale during Amazon Prime Day. Nécessaire Rosemary Shampoo Amazon The Nécessaire Rosemary Shampoo is a drug-free, plant-powered cleanser for fine, thinning, breakage-prone hair. Packed with its titular ingredient, the formula promotes new growth; moreover, it strengthens existing strands to mitigate excessive shedding, prevent premature snapping, and yield longer, healthier-looking hair. The formula's key ingredient, rosemary, boasts benefits beyond the culinary realm. According to science, the herb is equally powerful in the beauty sphere as a growth-proliferating hair care ingredient. Specifically, rosemary extract improves blood flow to the scalp—in turn, providing hair follicles with nutrients and stimulating new growth. Notably, one study even found rosemary to be as effective as minoxidil (the active ingredient in products like Rogaine) for staving off certain forms of hair loss. Nécessaire Rosemary Shampoo With Pump Amazon In addition to fuller, stronger, longer hair, Nécessaire's Rosemary Shampoo softens and smooths—while adding bounce and shine—after a single use. The formula is available in an 8.4-ounce size and a larger 16.9-ounce size, contained in a pump-style bottle. I'm doubling down on rosemary's thickening benefits with the corresponding Nécessaire Rosemary Conditioner. I'd be remiss to omit the olfactory bliss this shampoo emits once lathered: A meld of herbaceous, spa-like notes turns my shower into an instant oasis of calm. Plus, the packaging adds a touch of elegant, cool-girl sophistication to my bathroom. I'm hardly alone in my love for Nécessaire's Rosemary Shampoo. One shopper who had struggled with postpartum hair loss said their “hair is growing back in so rapidly” after three months of using the formula in combination with the corresponding conditioner. Another fan dubbed it an “awesome product for [treating] hair loss,” citing stronger strands and significantly less shedding within three months of incorporating the shampoo into their routine. Finally, another shopper with “thin” hair said their mane feels “thicker” after only a week. For fuller, bouncier, longer hair, shop the Nécessaire Rosemary Shampoo at Amazon before it returns to full price. Consider similar options below.

I know—it might sound silly, but there's always this lingering feeling that I'm forgetting something or missing out on a must-have. So, I did the due diligence and took one final (very big) sweep to find the 23 best last-chance Prime Day deals that I'm making mine before prices go back up. From fashion to beauty to home, this year's Prime Day 2025 is packed with incredible finds that are so good, I even texted my mom about it. “Mom, get that Bissell ASAP ,” I wrote to her. (Naturally, I'm getting this mini version that's cordless because, well, small NYC apartment.) I'm also stocking up on summer fashion staples, like this anti-LBD that's inspired by Reese Witherspoon . Best Last-Chance Prime Day Deals Overall Anti-LBD for Summer: Alice + Olivia Ella Sleeveless Drop Waist Mini Dress , $178 (Originally $395) Comfiest Summer Ballet Flats: Franco Sarto Tinsley Mary Jane Flats , $76 (Originally $125) The Secret to Frizz-Free Hair: Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray , $20 (Originally $28) Deep Clean Secret: Bissell Little Green Mini Cordless Portable Carpet and Upholstery Deep Cleaner , $120 (Originally $160) Medicube Zero Pore Pads 2.0 , $19 (Originally $31) No matter what you're looking for, or how much you've already shopped Amazon's Prime Day sale, I advise you to take one final look at my last-chance deals, below, to ensure that you, too, don't suffer from any FOMO.

So, I did the due diligence and took one final (very big) sweep to find the 23 best last-chance Prime Day deals that I'm making mine before prices go back up. From fashion to beauty to home, this year's Prime Day 2025 is packed with incredible finds that are so good, I even texted my mom about it. “Mom, get that Bissell ASAP ,” I wrote to her. (Naturally, I'm getting this mini version that's cordless because, well, small NYC apartment.)

I was the kind of kid who my mom had me clean the bathroom as one of my chores. I'm a messy, sloppy person myself, and so I have, like, the globs of toothpaste in the sink and the foundation and whatever; stuff is everywhere. It looks like I live in a sorority. When Scrubbing Bubbles asked me to partner with them, one, I got to go undercover as an odd corporate lady, interviewing unknowing participants. So the conceit was really fun. And two, I got to learn hands-on what an awesome product Scrubbing Bubbles Easy Clean is. I was telling them [Scrubbing Bubbles] earlier how fun it is to be talking about a product that I love and believe in — you don't even have to use a brush with it. It's miraculous.

I got to meet the chemists who developed it, and that was really cool. They [the chemists] were telling me how it took them three years to create this product and how excited they were. One of the chemists was even in the Scrubbing Bubbles mascot suit when we surprised the participants at the end with confetti. The whole shoot was super fun. It came at a really wild time in my life. We shot the campaign right after our home burned down in the LA fires, and I was so grateful to be so distracted and to be with such a supportive team. Everyone at Scrubbing Bubbles was so kind to me, so I am really grateful.

I was the kind of kid who my mom had me clean the bathroom as one of my chores. I'm a messy, sloppy person myself, and so I have, like, the globs of toothpaste in the sink and the foundation and whatever; stuff is everywhere. It looks like I live in a sorority. When Scrubbing Bubbles asked me to partner with them, one, I got to go undercover as an odd corporate lady, interviewing unknowing participants. So the conceit was really fun. And two, I got to learn hands-on what an awesome product Scrubbing Bubbles Easy Clean is. I was telling them [Scrubbing Bubbles] earlier how fun it is to be talking about a product that I love and believe in — you don't even have to use a brush with it. It's miraculous.

I got to meet the chemists who developed it, and that was really cool. They [the chemists] were telling me how it took them three years to create this product and how excited they were. One of the chemists was even in the Scrubbing Bubbles mascot suit when we surprised the participants at the end with confetti. The whole shoot was super fun. It came at a really wild time in my life. We shot the campaign right after our home burned down in the LA fires, and I was so grateful to be so distracted and to be with such a supportive team. Everyone at Scrubbing Bubbles was so kind to me, so I am really grateful.

B31196853518497590978B9CEF70CBB6,"  MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage (I charge from £1,150 for mine). Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 (£19.55, www.amazon.co.uk), Olaplex No.8 (£22.40, www.sephora.co.uk) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer (£21, www.boots.com). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner (£27, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner (£26, www.harrods.com). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now £17.99, sha op.toni www.ndguy.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now £12, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo (£24.50, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment (£25). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 (£19.55, www.amazon.co.uk), Olaplex No.8 (£22.40, www.sephora.co.uk) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer (£21, www.boots.com). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner (£27, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner (£26, www.harrods.com). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now £17.99, sha op.toni www.ndguy.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now £12, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo (£24.50, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment (£25). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....",2025-07-14 10:32:58,en,PRINT,,,,cluster_8,False,2,Positive,Trust,"The comment is a detailed, professional guide about hair care during summer, written with expertise ",True,True,Medium,4.402240514755249

397059B84031EE2F45D751CA8833E1A2,"  by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage. Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 ((EURO)29.50, www.brownthomas.com), Olaplex No.8 ((EURO)29.50, www.arnotts.ie) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer ((EURO)24.45, www.lookfantastic.ie). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner ((EURO)31, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner ((EURO)30, www.boots.ie). 4.

At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair.

You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now (EURO)22.49, www.cloud10beauty.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now (EURO)14, www.sephora.co.uk). 5.

n3waxl2,"  As someone with fine hair like yours that I'm starting to grow out, here's what I use to style my hair. I run my hair back and to side, though. I find these hold my hair well and doesn't make it greasy. OUAI wave spray - after towel drying my hair, I spray this in at the root and use my hands to get it all through my hair. Then blow dry my hair with a brush at first. I try to brush it up and back to get some volume. Then I use my hands to get it in the shape I want. I like the smell of this but it's not really a masculine scent haha. My wife told she can't smell it on me, if that helps. BLUMAAN Matte Cream Clay - I rub a dime sized amount between my palms and work it into my hair, starting on the back of my head so I don't get too much product gunked on the front. Work it all into my hair and then use my hands to style it. Not much scent on this. I just started this a month ago and have received 4 compliments so far lol.
