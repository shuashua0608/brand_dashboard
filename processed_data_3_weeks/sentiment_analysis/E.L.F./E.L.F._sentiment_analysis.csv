urn:li:ugcPost:7345615216849674240,"  Just like we say to our clients, 2025 is a year worthy of a first-half review. Here are a few things that excited, motivated and challenged me this year so far, with a huge thanks to those who supported along the way: 1. January - Traveled to Vietnam✅a bucket list place. While a personal trip, new places and culture always recharge and inspire me when I get back to work🌍. 2. February - Back to my Alma Mateur Hofstra University📚 to visit the SHE-EOS Women's Business Club💪🏼. It's always a highlight to share my journey and what I learned since being in the classroom. I'm still learning… 3. March - My first Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios Premiere🎬 events in NYC. It's amazing to see the behind-the-scenes of these launches. We even got to meet the parents of a debut actor in the film, who beamed with pride🥹. My client personally introduced herself to Kevin 🥓, so that was incredible. 4. April - Are we still celebrating in-person client events👏🏼? I sure am. The energy of brainstorming🧠 and celebrating🎉 in-person is like no other. Good ideas, and great company. 5. May - Mixing my personal joys with career firsts, I traveled to Hamburg, Germany for the 2025 OMR Festival 👩‍💻. Highlights were, of course, cheering on Kory Marchisotto & Rina Yashayeva for their keynote presentations. E.L.F. BEAUTY 💄continues to be a company I admire, for its creativity, but ultimately its accessibility to the beauty masses. Second - the sheer intelligence 🤯and evolution before my eyes. I saw presenters across industries share, truly, what makes their companies great. I loved being a student for two days, learning about the future of AI💻, what makes a company a good employer, and all things Scott Galloway had to share on predictions for the year. I had the chance to meet with our Amazon team across the pond, too! 6. June - With the wave 🌊of new hires joining CPG, I launched the first CPG Back to Basics Training Program📝, bringing tenured AMs as presenters to share client wins and challenges, best practices, and the “how tos” that often get lost in the chapters of onboarding. This was a favorite. What's next, 2025?","Just like we say to our clients, 2025 is a year worthy of a first-half review.

1lozl9k,"  Hello! I would really appreciate your help! I'm trying to build a simple, long-lasting base routine for both daily wear and small glam events. My skin is sensitive, acne-prone, and combination, so I really need something that: * Doesn't clog pores or break me out * Feels lightweight and comfortable * Lasts all day (I'm usually out from 6:30 AM to 7:30 PM, with gym after work — I can wash my face before the gym to remove makeup, but sometimes it's a hassle. That said, I'd rather have healthy skin, and the weather in my region is extremely hot in the summer and very cold in the winter) * I will be using that one product all over my face thinly for when I have events and such, but I only do that when there is something going on which is maximum 12 times a year and maybe even less. * Is actually worth the money (no fading, caking, or separating) **Budget for makeup:** I'd rather avoid expensive products that break the bank, but I'm willing to spend if it's something I'll truly use and not regret buying. I will be using that single product for a year or two, depending on its shelf life.

mov_7F13C1D100441F95585B55B3DE4496D4,"  Scooter Braun is transitioning his role at HYBE, the South Korean entertainment giant, moving from CEO of HYBE America to an advisory position which will have him joining the HYBE Board of Directors as a director and a senior advisor to chairman and CEO Bang Si-Hyuk. The move marks the end of a five-year run at HYBE, which is home to such K-pop acts as BTS and Katseye. The news was announced to HYBE staffers on Monday when Braun, dialing in from David Geffen's yacht where he is vacationing, notified employees that the move was “in the works for quite some time,” according to a source who adds that the five-year plan was initiated with the sale of Braun's Ithaca Holdings to HYBE in 2021. Braun will remain active in current HYBE projects, like the just-launched girl group Katseye. Braun intimated that he “isn't going anywhere” and will “still help guide” the artists on the HYBE roster. During the call, Braun shared with the staff that, when he set out for a career in music 25 years ago, it was after reading the Geffen biography The Operator. Today, as he closes this chapter of his career, he reminded his colleagues of what he's learned from Geffen: “Follow your dreams and anything can happen.” Braun built his business managing music artists like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, J Balvin, Demi Lovato and The Kid LAROI under the SB Projects banner. In 2024, he stepped away from the management business, announcing his decision on social media, where he noted, “I have been blessed to have had a 'Forrest Gump'-like life while witnessing and taking part in the journeys of some of the most extraordinarily talented people the world has ever seen. I'm constantly pinching myself and asking 'how did I get here?'” The exit from management coincided with a split from Bieber which turned contemptuous, as THR reported in April, due to financial consequences triggered by the cancelation of Bieber's Justice tour in 2022. In not fulfilling his contractual obligation to AEG (the tour's promoter) and completing the concert dates, for which he received a $40 million advance, Bieber was left owing more than $20 million to AEG. Then-manager Braun, through his company, covered what was owed in the form of a loan at a highly favorable (to Bieber) rate. In addition, the two were partnered in a number of other businesses including a record label and film projects. Braun also helped secure a $200 million catalog deal for Bieber's songwriting interests, possibly the largest nest egg in music history for an artist under 30. (Worth noting: Hailey Bieber, who married Justin in 2018, recently sold her Rhode Beauty skincare brand to e.l.f. Beauty for $1 billion; Braun was a seed investor.) THR has learned that a settlement between Braun and Bieber is now completed. “Scooter and Justin squashed their issues and are in a good place,” says a source who adds that Braun's last act at HYBE was to close the book on the squabble and “leave the company, and Justin, in a good position.” Reps for Bieber declined to comment on the settlement. Stepping into the CEO position in Braun's place and leading all day-to-day duties is Isaac Lee, who has been chairman of HYBE Latin America since November of 2023. Lee's new title is chairman and CEO of HYBE Americas. In addition to running HYBE's operations in Mexico, Miami, and Medellin, Lee will also have oversight of Nashville-based Big Machine Label Group (BMLG) and Quality Control Media Holdings, headquartered in Atlanta. While Braun's next move is unclear, HYBE chief Bang Si-Hyuk commented, “Scooter has been an extraordinary partner, a visionary executive, and a true catalyst for cultural exchange. His contributions have been vital in establishing our ambitious presence in the U.S. market. I am deeply grateful for his leadership, his astute instincts and his unwavering passion for artists. We wish him immense success in his exciting next chapter and look forward to continuing our partnership in executing HYBE's global vision.” More in Business Braun also remains one of HYBE's largest individual shareholders. In announcing his new role, Braun said: “Being a part of HYBE and witnessing its remarkable growth has been one of the most inspiring chapters of my professional journey. Chairman Bang is a true visionary and a musical genius. What he has built with HYBE is unparalleled. I am incredibly proud of our collective accomplishments and look forward to supporting Chairman Bang and CEO Jason Jaesang Lee in their continued success as I step into what's next.”","Scooter Braun is transitioning his role at HYBE, the South Korean entertainment giant, moving from CEO of HYBE America to an advisory position which will have him joining the HYBE Board of Directors as a director and a senior advisor to chairman and CEO Bang Si-Hyuk. The move marks the end of a five-year run at HYBE, which is home to such K-pop acts as BTS and Katseye. The news was announced to HYBE staffers on Monday when Braun, dialing in from David Geffen's yacht where he is vacationing, notified employees that the move was “in the works for quite some time,” according to a source who adds that the five-year plan was initiated with the sale of Braun's Ithaca Holdings to HYBE in 2021. Braun will remain active in current HYBE projects, like the just-launched girl group Katseye. Braun intimated that he “isn't going anywhere” and will “still help guide” the artists on the HYBE roster. During the call, Braun shared with the staff that, when he set out for a career in music 25 years ago, it was after reading the Geffen biography The Operator. Today, as he closes this chapter of his career, he reminded his colleagues of what he's learned from Geffen: “Follow your dreams and anything can happen.” Braun built his business managing music artists like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, J Balvin, Demi Lovato and The Kid LAROI under the SB Projects banner. In 2024, he stepped away from the management business, announcing his decision on social media, where he noted, “I have been blessed to have had a 'Forrest Gump'-like life while witnessing and taking part in the journeys of some of the most extraordinarily talented people the world has ever seen. I'm constantly pinching myself and asking 'how did I get here?'” The exit from management coincided with a split from Bieber which turned contemptuous, as THR reported in April, due to financial consequences triggered by the cancelation of Bieber's Justice tour in 2022. In not fulfilling his contractual obligation to AEG (the tour's promoter) and completing the concert dates, for which he received a $40 million advance, Bieber was left owing more than $20 million to AEG. Then-manager Braun, through his company, covered what was owed in the form of a loan at a highly favorable (to Bieber) rate. In addition, the two were partnered in a number of other businesses including a record label and film projects. Braun also helped secure a $200 million catalog deal for Bieber's songwriting interests, possibly the largest nest egg in music history for an artist under 30. (Worth noting: Hailey Bieber, who married Justin in 2018, recently sold her Rhode Beauty skincare brand to e.l.f. Beauty for $1 billion; Braun was a seed investor.) THR has learned that a settlement between Braun and Bieber is now completed. “Scooter and Justin squashed their issues and are in a good place,” says a source who adds that Braun's last act at HYBE was to close the book on the squabble and “leave the company, and Justin, in a good position.” Reps for Bieber declined to comment on the settlement. Stepping into the CEO position in Braun's place and leading all day-to-day duties is Isaac Lee, who has been chairman of HYBE Latin America since November of 2023. Lee's new title is chairman and CEO of HYBE Americas.

mov_3E08F639B785B717385F1598636A4322,"  NEW YORK (AP) — Fashion “dupes,” or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days. They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles. In the latest example, Lululemon slapped a lawsuit against Costco on Friday, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel. Across the retail industry, it's far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Hermès' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There's a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas. It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday's complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful companies have “replicated or copied” its apparel to sell cheaper offerings — including those popularized online through hashtags like “LululemonDupes” on TikTok and other social media platforms. Dupes aren't new For years, marketers have rolled out less expensive fashion and beauty alternatives for consumers to buy instead of pricey designer brands. Unlike more traditional counterfeits, which are illegal copies of the product that feature an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, “pure” dupes that resemble certain features of more expensive products are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items. But the rising frenzy for dupes signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing. Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Hermès' coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item — sold by Kamugo, which doesn't appear to have its own website — was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a “wirkin.” Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart's site selling similar totes. When dupes venture into uncertain legal territory Experts say some dupes move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly when a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original. Look-alikes can also frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the “wirkin,” for example, Hermès Executive Chairman Axel Dumas said he was “irritated” and “annoyed” by the cheaper look-alikes. More in Business “Making a copy like this is quite detestable,” Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was “quite touching” to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style — and that “difference in quality” was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Hermès. Meanwhile, Benefit sued E.l.f. for trademark infringement over its $6 Lash 'N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit's $29 Roller Lash mascara. But in December, a California judge found that E.l.f.'s mascara didn't deceive shoppers and didn't infringe the trademarks and trade dress of Benefit's item. That was the first lawsuit of its kind in E.l.f.'s 20-year-history, and the judge's decision was “a resounding win for us,” CEO Tarang Amin previously told The Associated Press. Amin doesn't like to call his version dupes, referring to them as “holy grails"" instead. “The basic reality is we always put our E.l.f. twist on it,” he said. “It's an E.l.f. product that's a much better value.” Lululemon sues Costco In its lawsuit, Lululemon argued that Costco had “unlawfully traded” on Lululemon's reputation and that it was suing as part of wider intellectual property enforcement “directed to retailers who have chosen to copy rather than compete.” A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Costco on the lawsuit. The litigation could be more complicated because Lululemon also alleges that customers know Costco uses manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, although the companies involved don't reveal that information. Due to this, Lululemon claims at least some shoppers may believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the “original” products. Lululemon accuses Costco of making duplicates of several producings, including its popular Scuba hoodies, Define jackets and ABC pants. Lululemon says one of the duplicates that Costco sells is the Hi-Tec Men's Scuba Full Zip, with the lawsuit showing a screenshot image of Costco's website showing the item priced at $19.97. Lululemon found itself in a similar dispute with Peloton back in 2021, when it sued the exercise bike company over alleged “copycat products” in its then-new clothing lines. Two years later, the companies announced a five-year partnership that included Lululemon becoming the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton. —- AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report.","NEW YORK (AP) — Fashion “dupes,” or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days.

They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles. In the latest example, Lululemon slapped a lawsuit against Costco on Friday, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel. Across the retail industry, it's far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Hermès' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There's a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas. It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday's complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful companies have “replicated or copied” its apparel to sell cheaper offerings — including those popularized online through hashtags like “LululemonDupes” on TikTok and other social media platforms. Dupes aren't new For years, marketers have rolled out less expensive fashion and beauty alternatives for consumers to buy instead of pricey designer brands. Unlike more traditional counterfeits, which are illegal copies of the product that feature an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, “pure” dupes that resemble certain features of more expensive products are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items. But the rising frenzy for dupes signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing. Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Hermès' coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item — sold by Kamugo, which doesn't appear to have its own website — was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a “wirkin.” Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart's site selling similar totes. When dupes venture into uncertain legal territory Experts say some dupes move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly when a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original. Look-alikes can also frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the “wirkin,” for example, Hermès Executive Chairman Axel Dumas said he was “irritated” and “annoyed” by the cheaper look-alikes. “Making a copy like this is quite detestable,” Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was “quite touching” to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style — and that “difference in quality” was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Hermès. Meanwhile, Benefit sued E.l.f. for trademark infringement over its $6 Lash 'N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit's $29 Roller Lash mascara. But in December, a California judge found that E.l.f.'s mascara didn't deceive shoppers and didn't infringe the trademarks and trade dress of Benefit's item. That was the first lawsuit of its kind in E.l.f.'s 20-year-history, and the judge's decision was “a resounding win for us,” CEO Tarang Amin previously told The Associated Press.

But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Hermès' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There's a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas. It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday's complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful companies have “replicated or copied” its apparel to sell cheaper offerings — including those popularized online through hashtags like “LululemonDupes” on TikTok and other social media platforms. Dupes aren't new For years, marketers have rolled out less expensive fashion and beauty alternatives for consumers to buy instead of pricey designer brands. Unlike more traditional counterfeits, which are illegal copies of the product that feature an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, “pure” dupes that resemble certain features of more expensive products are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items. But the rising frenzy for dupes signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing. Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Hermès' coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item — sold by Kamugo, which doesn't appear to have its own website — was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a “wirkin.” Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart's site selling similar totes. When dupes venture into uncertain legal territory Experts say some dupes move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly when a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original. Look-alikes can also frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the “wirkin,” for example, Hermès Executive Chairman Axel Dumas said he was “irritated” and “annoyed” by the cheaper look-alikes. “Making a copy like this is quite detestable,” Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was “quite touching” to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style — and that “difference in quality” was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Hermès. Meanwhile, Benefit sued E.l.f. for trademark infringement over its $6 Lash 'N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit's $29 Roller Lash mascara. But in December, a California judge found that E.l.f.'s mascara didn't deceive shoppers and didn't infringe the trademarks and trade dress of Benefit's item. That was the first lawsuit of its kind in E.l.f.'s 20-year-history, and the judge's decision was “a resounding win for us,” CEO Tarang Amin previously told The Associated Press. Amin doesn't like to call his version dupes, referring to them as “holy grails"" instead. “The basic reality is we always put our E.l.f. twist on it,” he said. “It's an E.l.f. product that's a much better value.” Lululemon sues Costco In its lawsuit, Lululemon argued that Costco had “unlawfully traded” on Lululemon's reputation and that it was suing as part of wider intellectual property enforcement “directed to retailers who have chosen to copy rather than compete.” A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Costco on the lawsuit. The litigation could be more complicated because Lululemon also alleges that customers know Costco uses manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, although the companies involved don't reveal that information. Due to this, Lululemon claims at least some shoppers may believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the “original” products. Lululemon accuses Costco of making duplicates of several producings, including its popular Scuba hoodies, Define jackets and ABC pants. Lululemon says one of the duplicates that Costco sells is the Hi-Tec Men's Scuba Full Zip, with the lawsuit showing a screenshot image of Costco's website showing the item priced at $19.97. Lululemon found itself in a similar dispute with Peloton back in 2021, when it sued the exercise bike company over alleged “copycat products” in its then-new clothing lines. Two years later, the companies announced a five-year partnership that included Lululemon becoming the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton. —- AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report.

BeautyのCMOであるコリー・マルキゾット氏は、「いまZ世代に刺さるのは、“完璧な映像”ではなく“リアルな共感”だ」と語りました。 完璧に編集されたビジュアルや脚本された言葉ではなく、むしろ未完成さや素直な表現の中に、ユーザーが自己を投影できる“余白”がある、そうした感性が支持を集めているという指摘でした。 e.l.f.は、TikTok上で自社の楽曲『Eyes. Lips. Face.』※2をバイラルヒットさせ、ユーザー生成コンテンツ戦略で注目を集めた後も、“共創型マーケティング”を軸にしたキャンペーン展開を続けています。 2024年から実施している、ジェンダーバイアスにユーモアで切り込んだ『So Many Dicks』キャンペーンが話題となり、Cannes Lions 2025ではCreative Data Lions部門（Use of Humor）でSilver Lionを受賞。 さらにTitanium Lionsのショートリストにも選出され、実績としても高く評価されました。 マルキゾット氏は「共創には、私たちが信じる“声”が必要だ」と強調し、「単なるエンタメではなく、“信念をもって語るストーリー”が、ロイヤリティと購買に直結する」と語っていました。 この「共感を起点としたストーリーテリング」は、単にSNSでの拡散を狙うものではなく、ブランドそのものの“人格”を表すものだとする視点は、非常に実践的です。 同様のテーマは、Hello Sunshineの創設者であり俳優・プロデューサーのリース・ウィザースプーン氏も共有していました。...","SPR_COMBO[ja]ブランド担当者こそ、この変化を見逃してはいけない。 「新しいキャンペーンを投下してもロイヤリティが高まらない」そんな企業マーケティングの“あるある”に、Cannes Lions 2025※1が明確なヒントをくれました。 企業でマーケティングやブランドを担当している皆さんにとって、Cannes Lionsは少し“遠い世界”に感じるかもしれません。 華やかなCMを表彰する祭典、そう思われている方も多いでしょう。 でも、実際に現地で話を聞いていると、むしろ今、企業側で日々マーケティングを回している人たちこそ見るべき内容ばかりだと感じました。 「データと感性のバランス」「ブランドパーパスの形骸化への問い直し」「AI時代の本当のクリエイティブとは何か」など、どれも今すぐ実務に関係するテーマです。 私自身も昨年に引き続き現地で参加しレポートを書いていますが、今年は特に“今すぐ実務に活かせる示唆”が多く、より深く感じる部分がありました。 「変わらない物語を軸にしながら、いかに接点を横断的に構築するか」それが今、世界中の優れたブランドに共通して見られる潮流だったからです。 このレポートでは、Mt.MELVIL（本社：Los Angeles, CA、CEO/エクゼクティブプロデューサー：村田未来子 日本支社：東京都渋谷区、CEO/エクゼクティブプロデューサー：山脇 愛理）のビジネスマネージャーとして、そして元・企業マーケターとして、Cannes Lions 2025の現地で得た“リアルな空気”をお届けします。 単なるセッションのまとめではなく、「明日から自社のマーケティングにどう活かせるか？」 という視点で抽出したヒントと問いを中心にお伝えします。 気温も熱気も最高潮のCannes会場より 【1. ストーリーの芯がブランドに“複利”をもたらす】 PepsiCo, Inc.（以下、PepsiCo）のGlobal CMOであるジェーン・ウェイクリー氏は、セッションで、「創造性は目的のない表現ではなく、成長のための手段である」と語り、食文化との結びつきがブランドのカテゴリー拡張においていかに重要かを強調しました。 Lay'sやCheetosなどの事例を通じて、“日常の中の物語を通じたブランド体験の再構築”が、事業成長と深く関係していることが示されました。 PepsiCoの元マーケティングVPであり、現在はKraft Heinz North AmericaのCMOを務めるトッド・カプラン氏は、ブランドとはリレーションシップであり、そこにはストーリーが欠かせないという姿勢を一貫して示してきました。 彼はこれまでも、一過性のバズではなく、語るべき“核”を定め、すべてのチャネルで繰り返し伝えていくことの重要性を主張しており、その考えは現在のブランドづくりにも通底しています。 この視点は、YouTube, LLC（以下、YouTube）CEOのニール・モーハン氏の「長く支持されるブランドは、語るべき“信念”を変えていない」という言葉とも重なります。 動画プラットフォームとして20年の軌跡を持つYouTubeは、変化し続けるテクノロジーの中でも、表現者とファンの“絆”を中心に据えたブランド構築を続けています。 また、ドラマ『This Is Us』のクリエイターであるダン・フォーゲルマン氏は、「脚本家として最も信頼するのは“驚き”と“心の痛み”。 そこにこそ人は惹きつけられる」と語り、自身の母親の死や家族の記憶など、個人的体験に根ざしたストーリーテリングが最も深く観客と接続する、とその背景を明かしました。 感情に響く表現こそが、物語の本質であり、ブランドにも通じる要素だと感じさせました。 単なる“わかりやすさ”や“映え”ではなく、繰り返し語られ、深く刺さるストーリーこそが、ブランドと生活者の関係に“複利”をもたらす。 その本質を、改めて感じさせられるセッションでした。 【2. 複数部門グランプリに見る“接点の越境”】 今年のCannes Lionsでは、単一チャネルや単発施策にとどまらず、社会・生活者・企業の“接点”を横断して作用するキャンペーンが高く評価されました。 1つのアイデアが複数の部門（＝視点）で受賞する傾向が見られたことは、今の時代におけるブランドの「振る舞い」の重要性を示しています。 特に注目を集めたのが、フランス発の保険グループAXAの『Three Words』キャンペーンです。 このキャンペーンは、Titanium Grand Prix、Direct、Creative Business Transformationの3部門でグランプリを受賞しました。 さらに、Film、Health & Wellness、Entertainmentなど複数部門でもGoldやBronzeを獲得し、その成果がAXA全体の高い評価に貢献。 AXAはCannes Lions2025において「Creative Brand of the Year」に選出されました。 『Three Words』キャンペーンの仕掛けはシンプルでありながら革新的。 住宅保険の契約文に“and domestic violence”を追加することで、家庭内暴力の被害者に対して避難・法的・心理的支援を保険の対象に含めたのです。 制度設計、サービス改善、社会的啓発の複数の接点を越境する設計が、多面的に評価された要因です。 また、Unilever傘下のDoveのキャンペーン『The Dove Code』（『Real Beauty Redefined for the AI Era』）は、Media部門でGrand Prixを獲得し、Glass部門でもショートリストに選出されました。 このキャンペーンでは、AIが生成するビジュアルが子どもたちの美意識に与える影響に着目し、教育用映像と「Real Beauty Prompt Playbook」を展開。 テクノロジー、教育、ジェンダーの接点をまたぐ設計によって、ブランドの社会的姿勢が高く評価されました。 さらに、Instagramの『Caption with Intention』は、Digital Craft、Design、Brand Experience & Activationの3部門でグランプリを受賞。 視覚障害のあるユーザーのためにaltテキスト記述の啓発活動、UI設計改善、クリエイター教育を並行展開し、テックとヒューマンセンタードデザインの交点に立つブランドの姿勢が評価されました。 これらの事例に共通していたのは、一発のバズや映えるビジュアルではなく、さまざまな接点を越境しながら連鎖的にブランド体験をつくっていること。 現代におけるブランド価値とは、単一チャネルのインパクトではなく、行動・サービス・社会的文脈が横断的につながる構造によって決まることを、今年のグランプリたちは示していました。 【3. “感情”が、体験設計の起点になる時代へ】 e.l.f.

An exquisite tinted lip balm shockingly similar to Clinique's ""Black Honey"" but doesn't cost nearly as much. It comes in a weightless, non-sticky formula that glides onto your pout to give 'em a subtle polished tint of your choosing. Soon you'll be smackin' your lips all over the place, and no one can really blame you when they look this good. ♀ My colleague Emma Lord can vouch for this: ""I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference!"" Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a pink honey version, individually, and as a two-pack that includes both!) . 2. A three-pack of retro-inspired polarized sunglasses that'll diversify your accessory portfolio with some vintage flair without overspending a single pair of Ray-Bans. It never hurts to have ✨options✨ and you won't find a better bang for your buck. Promising review: ""I've been buying these for years. They replaced my Ray-Bans that look identical! Fit great and with the price point I don't have to worry too much with my kids and being on the go!"" —Jessica M Get a pack of three from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in 13 sets, as well as packs of two and individual pairs). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you, like me, are wondering when sunscreen became one of the most expensive skincare items ever? Enter this affordable find, which offers SPF 35 *and* goes on smooth and clear without any white cast. It works well as a blurring primer to create the perf setup before applying makeup too! TL:DR; it's the more affordable version of Supergoop! My colleague Jenae Sitzes uses it: ""The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop! 's cult-fave product end.

's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop! 's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop! 's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop! 's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will!

353ffb64eee683bc3c4823c67a422e48,"  The Black Beauty market is exhibiting robust expansion driven by increasing consumer demand for inclusive and culturally resonant cosmetic and personal care products. Industry leaders are capitalizing on the growing preference for products tailored to diverse skin tones and hair textures, which is reshaping market dynamics significantly. Market Size and Overview The Global Black Beauty Market size is estimated to be valued at USD 8.96 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach USD 23.11 billion by 2032, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.5% from 2025 to 2032. Black Beauty Market Forecast indicates strong market opportunities fueled by rising awareness, product innovation, and expanded retail penetration. The market report highlights an escalating market revenue trajectory driven by the increasing demand for specialty skincare, cosmetics, and hair care products that address unique needs within the Black community. Impact of Geopolitical Situation on Supply Chain A notable real-world example is the US-China trade tariffs implemented in late 2024, which disrupted the supply of essential botanical extracts and synthetic ingredients vital to Black beauty formulations. This led to increased procurement costs for key players, compelling shifts toward nearshoring and strengthened supplier diversification in North America and Africa. Consequently, market growth strategies shifted to mitigate supply risks, ensuring steady market size expansion despite geopolitical turbulence. SWOT Analysis - Strengths: - Growing consumer demand for culturally attuned products is bolstering market revenue and industry size. - Enhanced R&D and personalization technologies increase market share and business growth potential. - Strong brand loyalty among core consumers fuels stable revenue streams. - Weaknesses: - Dependency on international raw materials exposes supply chains to geopolitical and economic uncertainties. - Regulatory compliance costs, especially in major markets like the EU, present ongoing market restraints. - Fragmented market segments in emerging regions limit rapid scalability. - Opportunities: - Rising e-commerce adoption in developing markets is expanding market scope and revenue streams. - Sustainability trends open markets for innovative natural and eco-friendly Black beauty products. - Strategic collaborations between market players and local manufacturers to optimize supply chains. - Threats: - Intensifying competition from niche and indie brands could dilute market share among established players. - Economic downturns and inflationary pressures might restrain consumer discretionary spending. - Political instability in key sourcing regions continues to threaten uninterrupted raw material flow. Key Players Key players driving the Black beauty market growth include L'Oréal S.A., Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Procter & Gamble Co., Unilever PLC, Revlon Inc., E.l.f.

5173a9a9a8de2f69f518598a9b580a5a,"  AARP Hearing Center Summer is not always smooth sailing … at least not beauty-wise. After 50, the challenges amp up as the weather and sun-and-fun lifestyle mess with our looks and confidence. Women say, “My makeup feels slimy and disappears in a pool of sweat” and “Help! I wear one-piece swimsuits but need some extra grooming,” or “I love breezy midi skirts, but how do I stop the chafing between my thighs?” So relatable! As a beauty and fashion editor, stylist and personal shopper for women over 50, I hear complaints like these daily. Here's how to avoid and solve some of the most talked-about disasters. 1. Melty, greasy, cakey makeup Some women insist that matte formulas and powder are the way to go when it comes to summer makeup. Big mistake! Combine that strategy with heat, sweat and a hot flash or two, and all you'll have is a cakey, dull mask on your face. Other women blithely ignore the weather and continue to layer serums, moisturizer, sunscreen and makeup like it's dry, icy February, not steamy July. Of course, this bunch ends up with a runny, soggy mess that's gooey, not glowy. Looking fresh-faced during a heat wave depends on your willingness to pare down your makeup routine in favor of multitasking products that prevent buildup and reduce slide. To keep skin plumped, protected and polished during the day, all you need is one thing: a tinted moisturizer with built-in sun protection, like Merit Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen SPF 45 ($38, kohls.com) or Tower 28 Beauty SunnyDays SPF30 Tinted Sunscreen Foundation ($32, sephora.com); or, for extra coverage, a CC cream like IT Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC+ Nude Glow SPF 40 ($47, target.com). The effect is subtly radiant and not greasy, sticky or shiny. If your skin feels wet or clammy as the day goes on, dampen a makeup sponge with cool water, squeeze out the excess and press it on spots where you have perspiration breakthrough. Then reapply the tinted moisturizer. If you're a heavy sweater, try a waterproof, sweatproof setting mist like Milani Make It Last Original- Natural Finish Setting Spray ($13, walgreens.com) or e.l.f. Stay All Night Micro-Fine Setting Mist ($10, cvs.com) — not powder. Simply spray it onto a makeup sponge and gently press it onto oil-prone areas like the sides of the nose and forehead, and in deep expression lines like those that extend from the nose to the mouth. 2. Bust, thigh and body chafing Can't stand the term “chub rub”? Me neither. However, it does describe the situation when one sweaty inner thigh meets its mate. This kind of irritation is not limited to the thighs. It also happens to bare, damp skin under sweaty bra bands and straps, sandal straps, waistbands on skirts and pants, even under the neckline border and leg-line openings of some swimsuits. One supereffective solution to chafing is wearing a light and stretchy control panty, like Red Hot by Spanx Women's Light Control Shapewear Primers Midthigh 10162R in Champagne Nude or Black ($26, kohls.com), under skirts and dresses, even breezy midis and maxis. Choose those with a cotton gusset that can be worn in place of underwear, long enough to cover the sensitive area. Anti-chafe sticks, a current and growing beauty trend, are another way to go. Designed like stick deodorant, they have a silky, almost powderlike finish that glides over the skin and creates a stay-put barrier to friction while soothing irritation with ingredients like aloe, coconut oil, grapeseed oil and shea butter. Some, like Megababe Thigh Rescue Anti-Friction Stick ($14, target.com), are designed for a specific spot. Others, like Dove Anti-Chafe Whole Body Deo in Raspberry & Rose ($13, cvs.com), which is gynecologist- and dermatologist-approved, and First Aid Beauty Anti-Chafe Stick ($20, nordstrom.com), work head to toe. 3. Frizzy, out-of-control hair Summer is frizz season. Just ask women who struggle to keep their smooth, sleek blowouts and polished curls from going haywire. Sure, genes are partly to blame, but sizzling, humid temperatures also cause styled hair to revert to its prestyled texture. Here's why: Once hair escapes the cool indoor environment of air-conditioning, it absorbs moisture from the air, and the hair shaft swells and produces a fluffy, unruly look. Your best fast fix is a chic hair band, claw clip or scrunchie, so throw these in your bag on humid days. Many women ask me about salon keratin treatments. They do delete frizz for the summer, but the intense chemicals, including formaldehyde, and reactions, including headache, stinging eyes, throat issues, and rashes, are a turnoff. So is the $350 to $800 cost and the possible harm to weak, fragile, thin or damaged hair. My advice? Try one of the new frizz banishers that activate with the heat from a blow-dryer. Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray for Frizzy Hair ($12, kohls.com), Tresemmé Keratin Smooth Blowout Heat Protectant Spray ($9, target.com) and John Frieda Frizz Ease Smooth Operator Blowout Spray ($12, cvs.com) keep hair smooth through three or more shampoos. Unlike frizz serums and creams, there's no heavy residue to weigh hair down, and results last for a steamy, sticky week or two. It's worth the extra time and effort to do the initial precise, section-by-section blow-dry with a round brush.","AARP Hearing Center Summer is not always smooth sailing … at least not beauty-wise. After 50, the challenges amp up as the weather and sun-and-fun lifestyle mess with our looks and confidence. Women say, “My makeup feels slimy and disappears in a pool of sweat” and “Help! I wear one-piece swimsuits but need some extra grooming,” or “I love breezy midi skirts, but how do I stop the chafing between my thighs?” So relatable! As a beauty and fashion editor, stylist and personal shopper for women over 50, I hear complaints like these daily. Here's how to avoid and solve some of the most talked-about disasters. 1. Melty, greasy, cakey makeup Some women insist that matte formulas and powder are the way to go when it comes to summer makeup. Big mistake! Combine that strategy with heat, sweat and a hot flash or two, and all you'll have is a cakey, dull mask on your face. Other women blithely ignore the weather and continue to layer serums, moisturizer, sunscreen and makeup like it's dry, icy February, not steamy July. Of course, this bunch ends up with a runny, soggy mess that's gooey, not glowy. Looking fresh-faced during a heat wave depends on your willingness to pare down your makeup routine in favor of multitasking products that prevent buildup and reduce slide. To keep skin plumped, protected and polished during the day, all you need is one thing: a tinted moisturizer with built-in sun protection, like Merit Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen SPF 45 ($38, kohls.com) or Tower 28 Beauty SunnyDays SPF30 Tinted Sunscreen Foundation ($32, sephora.com); or, for extra coverage, a CC cream like IT Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC+ Nude Glow SPF 40 ($47, target.com). The effect is subtly radiant and not greasy, sticky or shiny. If your skin feels wet or clammy as the day goes on, dampen a makeup sponge with cool water, squeeze out the excess and press it on spots where you have perspiration breakthrough. Then reapply the tinted moisturizer. If you're a heavy sweater, try a waterproof, sweatproof setting mist like Milani Make It Last Original- Natural Finish Setting Spray ($13, walgreens.com) or e.l.f. Stay All Night Micro-Fine Setting Mist ($10, cvs.com) — not powder. Simply spray it onto a makeup sponge and gently press it onto oil-prone areas like the sides of the nose and forehead, and in deep expression lines like those that extend from the nose to the mouth. 2. Bust, thigh and body chafing Can't stand the term “chub rub”? Me neither. However, it does describe the situation when one sweaty inner thigh meets its mate. This kind of irritation is not limited to the thighs. It also happens to bare, damp skin under sweaty bra bands and straps, sandal straps, waistbands on skirts and pants, even under the neckline border and leg-line openings of some swimsuits. One supereffective solution to chafing is wearing a light and stretchy control panty, like Red Hot by Spanx Women's Light Control Shapewear Primers Midthigh 10162R in Champagne Nude or Black ($26, kohls.com), under skirts and dresses, even breezy midis and maxis.

mov_33E982F53C181F341373D4BD90E47C46,"  ""It's pretty much identical,"" —A reviewer comparing this $12 E.l.f. alternative to Glow Recipe's $35 Watermelon Dew Drops. 1. An exquisite tinted lip balm shockingly similar to Clinique's ""Black Honey"" but it doesn't cost nearly as much. This weightless, non-sticky formula glides onto your pout to give 'em a subtle polished tint of your choosing. Soon you'll be smackin' your lips all over the place, and no one can blame you when they look this good. ♀ My colleague Emma Lord can vouch for this: ""I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference!"" Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a pink honey version, individually, and as a two-pack that includes both!) . 2. Catrice ""Instant Awake"" Under Eye Brightener — it'll help liven up your tired eyes with a lightweight formula that delivers superb coverage in just a few swipes. This tinted concealer contains hyaluronic acid and shea butter that may also help reduce dark circles over time. It's just like the $33 Becca version but for MUCH less. Promising reviews: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" —Placeholder ""I ran across this when looking to replace my $33 Becca under-eye brightening cream, and since money is tight, I took a chance. Very surprised to find this product to be comparable in coverage and staying power, and superior in moisture. Highly recommend!"" —Nancy Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). 3. A TikTok-beloved ""Soft"" perfume rollerball reviewers can't stop raving about, with some even comparing it to lemon pound cake. YUM! This is gonna be a real treat for your senses *and* it rolls on nice and easy. It's basically a budget-friendly version of Pink Sugar, which goes for $65. Promising review: ""It's definitely a [swap] for Pink Sugar, only better. To me, Pink Sugar has changed and now dries down to a too-forward pepper smell that overpowers the sugar. This doesn't do that, it's exactly like Pink Sugar when it first goes on with sweet and powdery scent profiles, and remains that way after dry down...on me, this is what I'm getting anyway. It lasts and lasts too like a quality oil perfume should."" —Criss Get it from Amazon for $4.50. 4. A lash-extending E.l.f. Cosmetics tubing mascara because your lashes deserve the best and you don't wanna waste your time with dry, clumpy (pricey) formulas. This one is perfect for thin, delicate lashes and is similar to Thrive. The lightweight tubing technology wraps around your eyelashes for a smudge-proof lift that looks natural. Plus, it's super easy to take off at the end of the day without tons of harsh scrubbing. Check out a TikTok of the E.l.f. mascara in action....","""It's pretty much identical,"" —A reviewer comparing this $12 E.l.f. alternative to Glow Recipe's $35 Watermelon Dew Drops. 1. An exquisite tinted lip balm shockingly similar to Clinique's ""Black Honey"" but it doesn't cost nearly as much. This weightless, non-sticky formula glides onto your pout to give 'em a subtle polished tint of your choosing. Soon you'll be smackin' your lips all over the place, and no one can blame you when they look this good. My colleague Emma Lord can vouch for this: ""I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference!"" Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a pink honey version, individually, and as a two-pack that includes both!) . 2. Catrice ""Instant Awake"" Under Eye Brightener — it'll help liven up your tired eyes with a lightweight formula that delivers superb coverage in just a few swipes. This tinted concealer contains hyaluronic acid and shea butter that may also help reduce dark circles over time. It's just like the $33 Becca version but for MUCH less. Promising reviews: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" —Placeholder ""I ran across this when looking to replace my $33 Becca under-eye brightening cream, and since money is tight, I took a chance. Very surprised to find this product to be comparable in coverage and staying power, and superior in moisture. Highly recommend!"" —Nancy Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). 3.

Always apply hyaluronic acid after washing your skin especially while your skin is still damp for maximum absorbtion. Ps.

The division accounted for 11% of L'Oréal's 2024 sales, with haircare as its growth category behind fragrance Color Wow's Edge: Founded by gail federici (co-founder of John Frieda Professional Care John Frieda) Hero products like Coat built a cult following and Amazon dominance (14.8% share in hairspray) 878K+ TikTok followers and nearly 800K units sold on TikTok Shop 73% Amazon growth YoY, 24% EMV growth, and unmatched product page storytelling This deal follows a flurry of beauty transactions: Unilever acquired Dr. Squatch ($1.5B) and K18 ($700M) E.L.F. BEAUTY scooped up rhode skin (up to $1B) Church & Dwight Co., Inc. & Dwight bought touchland (up to $880M) Industry insiders say this is no anomaly—it's a signal. Performance, staying power, and science-backed results are driving the next wave of high-value exits. Is haircare the next billion-dollar beauty frontier? Which brands are poised to be next?

The 59-year-old actor has heaped praise on model Hailey, 28, after she sold off her Rhode beauty brand for the massive sum. Speaking on The Adam Corolla Show podcast, he said: ""The cool part of it is she's super smart, smart in business. ""Succeeded as a model prior to everything she's doing now. But the cool part was she actually had an offer to do something pretty big and cool in the cosmetics a couple years ago and didn't. ""The reason it's succeeding is people are responding to it. It actually works as hydration and all of that."" Stephen - who is also father to actress Alaia, 32, - added that he has ""remained the same"" throught the success of his children and insisted that they can always rely on him to be honest with them. He said: ""The sweet part of my kids, too, is, in the wake of whatever their success is, their dad remains the same. I've always been the same way. You know you're going to tell your daughter the truth."" Hailey - who is married to pop star Justin Bieber and has 11-month-old son Jack Blues with him - sold her company to e.l.f.

And remember, like with any retinol (that actually works) *just do not use it every day. * Start slow and work yourself up if needed, paying attention to your skin. Promising review: ""I absolutely love this stuff! I saw a dermatologist on TikTok who raved about this product and tried it out, and it's been the most amazing stuff! It's helped my face to clear up very quickly removing all of the blemish spots and dark spots around my face. It's been one of the best products I've added to my face routine. This would be great for all ages/stages and for any weather types. It doesn't moisturize much, but that's not it's intention, and there is no scent, so I'd imagine it's great for all skin types and hypoallergenic."" —Successful Solo Promising review: ""I bought this for my teenager to use for his acne scars, but he ended up not using it. I ran out of my Murad retinol serum, so I gave this a try. I actually like it better than the Murad! It absorbs quickly, with zero smell or irritation. As with any retinol product, be sure to wear sunscreen when you're going to be outside."" —C. Munsterman Get it from Amazon for $18.68. 2. E.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter that reviewers say is comparable to (or even better than) Charlotte Tilbury's famous Flawless Filter. Apply this as a luminous, blurring base, mix it with your moisturizer or foundation, or dot it over makeup as a natural-looking highlight. It's formulated with hyaluronic acid and squalene for a boost of hydration too! Promising review: ""This stuff is so legit I've gone through three bottles. Adds the perfect glow to your skin! Sometimes I use it under foundation, and sometimes, I use it solo with a bit of concealer. I will never not repurchase it for the price and how beautifully it sits on the skin. This stuff is viral for a reason!!"" —mapagill Promising review: ""If you like Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter, this is leaps and bounds better! Just buy it. The coverage is better and makes my skin have the most amazing natural glow! The colors run with a more warm/yellow undertone, which worked great for me! Spend a fraction of the price and just get it; you will be happy you did!"" —Amazonreview Get it from Amazon for $14 (available in 12 shades). 3. And their Halo Glow Beauty Wand, a buildable liquid highlighter formula that delivers a majorly radiant, lit-from-within finish to your skin without lots of glitter (like Charlotte Tilbury's highlighter blush wands). The cushion-tip applicator is super easy to apply, too! One reviewer says it's an alternative to the Charlotte Tilbury highlighters! Promising review: ""We saw this highlighter in a makeup tutorial video online and thought we would try it. It was an easy decision to purchase it because the price was relatively low compared to other highlighters. It is worth every penny and more! I've seen this shade applied on different skin tones and it looks beautiful on everyone! Just the right shimmer, not glitter.

mov_B58F2493E0835F8513A519F3C794AE3D,"  This blurring powder is basically pure witchcraft and your *best* weapon against heat and humidity. And no, it's not the $59 Givenchy version. 1. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder, which is SO GOOD at eliminating shine and blurring pores that I feel like it'd smirk at you and go, ""How 'bout that, huh? "" if it had a human form. If you dread summer because you love wearing makeup but the heat and humidity leave it looking patchy, this'll lock it in with a smooth, semi-matte finish. Your oily T-zone doesn't know what's coming for it. One reviewer compares this to a $59 Givenchy powder! Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""This is the secret for makeup in hot and humid climates! I am a sweaty person, but I also love wearing makeup regardless of the weather. While holidaying in Southeast Asia at the start of wet season, I faced temperatures between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius (95–104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity. After finishing my base makeup, I applied this powder all over. I did not use a setting spray because most break me out. Luckily, no setting spray was necessary while using this setting powder! It kept my foundation and cream blush from separating or becoming patchy, and also kept me from being too shiny. I reapplied a couple of times per day. This is magical and I will definitely be using regularly during the summers in North America too!"" —Sara Lima Get it from Amazon for $25. 2. A smocked midi dress because Hill House's Nap Dress is truly ~dreamy~ but your bank account is like, ""Um, we still need to buy groceries."" This cutie's a fraction of the cost and just as gorgeous, not to mention breathable as heck thanks to its 100% organic cotton poplin fabric. Prepare to fall head over heels for this dress — I definitely did. I recently wore this dress (in shade Lipstick Pink) to an outdoor wedding and I. AM. OBSESSED. It hugs my frame beautifully with the stretchy smocked waist — I can even get away with not wearing a bra, though for context I'm a B cup — and the flowy bottom of the dress sits just right. I personally haven't tried Hill House's Nap Dress (I drool over the designs, but $178 is a little too steep for me), but I'm perfectly happy to stock up on this dress in a few colors for around the same price. My colleague Heather Braga, on the other hand, is a Hill House devotee — but even she was impressed by this cheaper option: ""Listen, I am the proud owner of NINE Hill House Nap Dresses. I condone splurging on them (truly, by all means) and will be the first to tell you they are worth every penny. That being said, I tried out one of these from Quince and LOVE it. I have the Tribeca Stripe pattern and cannot believe how similar it feels to the other brand. It's my current go-to style for my frame (two kids in two years, send prayers) and is one of the few things I know I can throw on and KNOW I look great. Will definitely add another to an upcoming order and have been shouting from the rooftops how wonderful this brand fits."" Get it from Quince for $69.90 (available in sizes XS–XL and nine styles). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you're still trying to find a daily sunscreen you don't despise. This clear gel sunscreen offers SPF 35 and goes on so smooth and lightweight, you'll immediately forget you're wearing it — no white cast here, folks. It doubles as a blurring primer, so it's great for wearing under makeup too! If you love Supergoop but the price is becoming hard to swallow...may I suggest trying this, because it's *very* similar. The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!...","This blurring powder is basically pure witchcraft and your *best* weapon against heat and humidity.

In May Hailey Bieber, wife of Justin Bieber, a pop star, sold her make-up brand Rhode to e.l.f. Beauty, a cosmetics firm, for as much as $1b. As the boundary between retail and social media blurs, celebrities are reshaping the world of consumer goods. The proliferation of celebrity brands is partly a reflection of changes in the media industry. In decades past, the business of communicating with consumers was largely intermediated by a handful of television channels, radio stations and print publications. No more. These days, says Douglas Holt, a marketing guru, every social-media account is a channel of its own. That has allowed celebrities to engage directly with their fans. Ms Kardashian has over 350m followers on Instagram. She frequently wears and talks about Skims online. “Kim is a phenomenal creative director,” says Jens Grede, her co-founder, “but she's also a one-woman media powerhouse.” According to Launchmetrics, an analytics firm, Skims last year generated more than $US600m in “media impact value”, a gauge of the monetary benefit of online posts, press coverage and other media exposure. That was eight times as much as for Spanx, a rival shapewear brand. Not only are celebrities now able to communicate directly with their fans. They can sell directly to them, too. Fledgling brands no longer need to sell via big retailers, who take a cut of profits, or to open physical stores, which involves enormous upfront investment. To sell online, they do not even need to go through e-commerce platforms like Amazon. Tools such as those offered by Shopify, a Canadian software firm, have made it easier than ever to build an e-commerce site or mobile app. Social-media platforms such as TikTok now allow brands to sell directly to users, too. Direct-to-consumer sales have risen to account for around one-seventh of e-commerce globally, according to NIQ, a data provider. Anita Balchandani of McKinsey, a consultancy, reckons they make up as much as 100 per cent of revenue in the early days of a typical celebrity brand, dropping to 30-60 per cent as firms expand and add third-party distribution. Of course, not every celebrity brand takes off. The Honest Company, a maker of baby and beauty products co-founded by Jessica Alba, an actress, has lost three-quarters of its market value since listing its shares in 2021. Alex Griffin, marketing chief for On, a sportswear brand worn by tennis player Roger Federer and actress Zendaya, says there is a reason many stars still opt for endorsements instead of starting their own brands: “It's not that easy.” Picking the right type of product matters. Clothes and booze are things people often buy for what they symbolise, rather than their functionality, says Sandra Cariglio of ReD Associates, an advisory firm. That makes them safer bets for celebrities. Attractive stars may naturally find it easy to sell beauty products, too. It helps that the production of cosmetics is easy to outsource to white-label manufacturers, as it is for fragrances. Jill Avery of Harvard Business School adds that products need to “fit” the celebrity's own brand. Fans buy make-up from Ms Bieber because she has long shared beauty tips online, and shapewear from Ms Kardashian because she is known for her curves.

1ludsxs,"  I turn red in the face and I'm struggling to cover it up properly and effectively. So, for some context as to how this began: I started a medication last Christmas and with every medication comes their side effects as most would know. I didn't know that my medication would stop me from sweating as it was always cold in the house because it was winter, but once it started getting warmer, my face would turn red often even from the littlest bit of warmth. And I know some might say that's normal and unavoidable, but I've never had it happen as often and as severe as this. In previous years, including last year, my cheeks were the only part on my face that would frequently turn red from warmth. Nowadays, my medication causes my face to turn red when I'm even just a little bit too warm. The only way to help battle the redness without makeup (and also because I'm literally too overheated to function) is to cool myself down with air conditioning because nothing else helps. The reason I'm making this post is because I have been struggling with makeup lately to help cover up my redness (oftentimes before it happens), especially when I'm leaving the house. I've never turned this red before, and even if I did, it was usually only on my cheeks, not my entire face like it is nowadays thanks to the medication… I have dry and sensitive skin, and not a lot of products have worked for me, but for a couple months now, I have been using Jason Wu's Tinted Moisturizer Meets CC Cream and it's been the best base makeup product I've used in years! I've also switched from putting the green shade from the NYX Color Corrector palette all over my face (exhausting because it takes forever to work into the skin) to recently using Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (because I use their normal Age Rewind Concealer and I've loved it since forever). I have also purchased the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer since someone I know recommended it for my situation, but I haven't tried it yet since I don't understand how it helps… And no, this post isn't just me rambling about my struggles with makeup. I'm here asking for help from those who may have experience with these products, this situation, or those who have professional makeup advice for me. There's a few issues I've been having with my makeup lately: 1. I've found that sometimes touching my face will take my tinted moisturizer right off, or if my nail presses ever so slightly onto my skin, that it'll remove the makeup in that exact area. I've tried to combat this by setting my face with the only setting powder I own, which is one from E.L.F. I just don't remember the name. I've only done this method once and it seemed to have helped but I'm unsure about how much it helped. 2. If I don't apply enough of my chosen colour corrector (remember, I still haven't tried the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer yet) underneath my tinted moisturizer, then my redness will shine through later on and it makes me feel horrible about myself (I know many people have rosacea and other skin conditions that can cause mass redness, but I'm just remaining honest on how my type of redness makes me feel, so please don't take any offence as I don't mean any…). 3. To conclude this, I'm also heavily struggling with how to make this whole process simpler and less stress-inducing because I'm oftentimes trying to cover my redness before it actually appears, so I cannot tell how much green will help combat the red. Sometimes I've used too little and later my redness peeked through my makeup, or I've used too much and I've had to put on a lot of tinted moisturizer to cover it. It was also my first time using setting powder because I was scared it would cause me to dry out because of my skin type. I just need some advice… If anyone has any questions regarding what I mentioned, then please ask. I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions from anyone who is familiar with this or knows, professionally, how to help. I'm also on a tight budget as I barely make any money nowadays, so purchasing luxury beauty products or pricy items is something I'd very much like to avoid unless there's no other way. Sorry for this jumble of stuff. I've just been so frustrated lately and I've gotten very tired of spending a lot of time looking up how to help with these things and coming up with nothing, either because the advice found didn't help or wasn't the right solution to my problem. Thank you. ***TL;DR: I've been turning red in the face from a medication I take that stops me from sweating (meaning I cannot cool myself down). I'm struggling to both cover this up and maintain my makeup without it smudging off or rubbing off by a small tap to the face. Products mentioned: - Jason Wu's Tinted Moisturizer Meets CC Cream (my base product) - NYX Color Corrector Palette (used to use their green shade to cover my whole face) - Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (currently use to cover the red underneath my tinted moisturizer) - E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer (bought as a suggestion from a friend but I haven't used it due to confusion on how it works)","I turn red in the face and I'm struggling to cover it up properly and effectively.

I've also switched from putting the green shade from the NYX Color Corrector palette all over my face (exhausting because it takes forever to work into the skin) to recently using Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (because I use their normal Age Rewind Concealer and I've loved it since forever). I have also purchased the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer since someone I know recommended it for my situation, but I haven't tried it yet since I don't understand how it helps… And no, this post isn't just me rambling about my struggles with makeup. I'm here asking for help from those who may have experience with these products, this situation, or those who have professional makeup advice for me. There's a few issues I've been having with my makeup lately: 1. I've found that sometimes touching my face will take my tinted moisturizer right off, or if my nail presses ever so slightly onto my skin, that it'll remove the makeup in that exact area. I've tried to combat this by setting my face with the only setting powder I own, which is one from E.L.F. I just don't remember the name. I've only done this method once and it seemed to have helped but I'm unsure about how much it helped. 2. If I don't apply enough of my chosen colour corrector (remember, I still haven't tried the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer yet) underneath my tinted moisturizer, then my redness will shine through later on and it makes me feel horrible about myself (I know many people have rosacea and other skin conditions that can cause mass redness, but I'm just remaining honest on how my type of redness makes me feel, so please don't take any offence as I don't mean any…). 3. To conclude this, I'm also heavily struggling with how to make this whole process simpler and less stress-inducing because I'm oftentimes trying to cover my redness before it actually appears, so I cannot tell how much green will help combat the red. Sometimes I've used too little and later my redness peeked through my makeup, or I've used too much and I've had to put on a lot of tinted moisturizer to cover it. It was also my first time using setting powder because I was scared it would cause me to dry out because of my skin type. I just need some advice… If anyone has any questions regarding what I mentioned, then please ask. I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions from anyone who is familiar with this or knows, professionally, how to help. I'm also on a tight budget as I barely make any money nowadays, so purchasing luxury beauty products or pricy items is something I'd very much like to avoid unless there's no other way. Sorry for this jumble of stuff. I've just been so frustrated lately and I've gotten very tired of spending a lot of time looking up how to help with these things and coming up with nothing, either because the advice found didn't help or wasn't the right solution to my problem. Thank you. ***TL;DR: I've been turning red in the face from a medication I take that stops me from sweating (meaning I cannot cool myself down). I'm struggling to both cover this up and maintain my makeup without it smudging off or rubbing off by a small tap to the face.

mov_79A661DC8BA2EC26E49A2ABA92F9599E,"  Higher prices for a lot of popular products seem inevitable on our current trajectory. James Martin/CNET In many cases and for many products in the US, the biggest impacts of President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff plans haven't hit yet — but that could be about to change as the 90-day pause on the “reciprocal” tariffs is set to end this week. However things shake out, numerous companies have already hiked prices or said that they'll increase in the near-future — including, most recently, a popular and CNET-approved brand of smart lights. The fact of the matter is that tariffs — a tax placed on the importing of certain products into a country — will ultimately cause prices to go up, with Walmart characterizing these eventual price hikes as “inevitable” during its earnings call last month. Given Trump's push to place historically high tariffs on goods from almost every country in the world, you can also expect these price hikes to hit a huge variety of products. This truth has begun to sink in for a lot of Americans. About 64% of American adults are making tech purchases soon to avoid potential price hikes, according to CNET's most recent tariff sentiment survey. Around 51% of Americans adults also said that they already bought or plan to buy a personal tech device — such as a smartphone, laptop or tablet — soon. To help you keep score, I've put together a list of all the companies that have either confirmed or warned of price hikes due to Trump's tariffs. As other companies make such announcements, you can expect new names to be added here. Continue on for all those details, and for more, find out why it's best if you wait on buying a new iPhone. One item you won't find on this list yet? The original Nintendo Switch, which will see a currently unspecified price hike on Aug. 1, but only in Canada for the time being. If that increase makes its way south of the border, we'll let you know. Best Buy Without getting into specifics, Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told the Wall Street Journal late last month that it has already raised prices on certain products as part of its response to the tariffs. e.l.f. Known as an affordable option in the beauty world, e.l.f. announced in late May that it would be implementing a $1 price hike across its product line in response to the tariffs. CEO Tarang Amin claimed that the reaction from customers was positive, on account of the company's transparency. “We're not trying to pull anything over on anyone,” Amin told Fortune. “This is exactly what we're facing, and they understand.” Macy's Speaking to CNBC in late May, Macy's CEO Tony Spring said that price hikes will be implemented on some products due to tariffs, while also emphasizing that other tactics — like discontinuing certain products altogether — will also be a response to rising costs. Mattel Known for brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, Mattel sounded the alarm over likely price increases during an early May earnings call. While it's unclear how much the toymaker's prices have increased since then, the company told investors that it would be, “where necessary, taking pricing action in its US business,” or to put it plainly, raising prices for consumers to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Nikon Camera-maker Nikon will introduce price hikes in response to Trump's tariffs, effective June 23. This move will only target lenses and accessories the company makes and sells, so the cameras themselves are safe for now. “We will be carefully monitoring any tariff developments and may adjust pricing as necessary to reflect the evolving market conditions,” a statement from Nikon explained. “We wish to thank our customers for their understanding and know that we are taking every possible step to minimize the impact on our community.” Philips Hue Parent company Signify announced that prices for its popular and highly regarded Philips Hue brand of smart lights will see price hikes effective July 1. The company also confirmed that this decision was made “as a direct result of tariffs.” “Signify reserves the right to modify prices based on new or additional tariffs becoming effective in the future,” the company's official statement explained. Ralph Lauren Sales at the luxury goods retailer Ralph Lauren have apparently remained steady amid recent uncertainty, but the company is still forging ahead with a plan to combat tariff impacts by raising prices more than it had already intended to, according to the Wall Street Journal. Shein and Temu Trump's tariffs have made a notable target of China, hitting the country with a 30% rate only after initially hiking it all the way to 145%. Online retailers like Shein and Temu rely on direct shipments from markets like China in order to offer the rock-bottom prices that made them famous, so it's little surprise now that they've had to raise prices. The Trump administration has furthered the issues faced by these companies by doing away with a rule known as the “de minimus” exception, which used to exclude smaller purchases under $800 from import taxes. With that rule gone, Trump's China tariffs will now apply to both bulk orders of industrial building materials and those shoes you've been looking to buy from Shein. Subaru Subaru has hiked prices across almost its entire line. The increase ranged from $750 to $2,055, depending on the model, with only the EV Solterra avoiding any change. As has become a trend with some companies, Subaru avoided attributing the price hikes to Trump's tariffs, citing only the common refrain of “market conditions.” Trump has notably disparaged companies that explicitly lay the blame for price hikes on his policies. “The changes were made to offset increased costs while maintaining a solid value proposition for the customer. Subaru pricing is not based on the country of origin of its products,” a Subaru spokesperson said in a statement to Car & Driver....","Higher prices for a lot of popular products seem inevitable on our current trajectory.

mov_2772BA8226CF395470239914A63E9D8D,"  Last week's episode of saw Pressure K leaving alongside Alexander the Great in a heartbreaking double elimination. While every episode thus far in this inaugural season of the groundbreaking series has delivered on both laughs and heartfelt moments (truly, this show is of drag), this week's hit even harder. This time, the challenge was all about tapping into and embodying the competitors' deepest fears, and what that meant for many of the kings was unpacking their trauma and opening up some of their most vulnerable sides to the world. Leading the charge in that regard was . The comic and pride of the Atlanta king community opened up in ways that neither the kings, the audience, the judges, but most of all ever expected (Pressure K uses he/him pronouns in drag, and she/her off stage). It began with the weenie challenge, in which the kings were tasked with creating a dual makeup look, one side of their face being beautiful and the other monstrous, using e.l.f. Cosmetics. It proved to be an emotional challenge for Pressure K, who revealed a traumatic experience and relationship with makeup. “I came home to makeup,” he shared with his fellow kings. A loaded statement that only becomes more harrowing when you hear the story behind it. Courtesy of Pressure K “My mother felt like she needed to teach me how to be a woman,” Pressure recalls to PRIDE. “So I was, like, legit taking classes. ' This is what a woman does.' Or like, if I do something, 'what you did is wrong, this is what you're supposed to do.' [It] got to a point where I felt like feminine activities became a punishment.” As a result of some perceived deviation from prescribed womanhood, one day in her teens, Pressure came home one day to find someone waiting for her. “I'm not exactly sure what I did. I might have, like, wore a hat, or they might have caught me in baggy clothes. I might have made an aggressive move, and I came home to the Mary Kay party,” she recalls. While Pressure put on a happy face, one she says her mother had trained her to adopt growing up, “I knew how to like...” Pressure says while demonstrating a happy expression. “People think I'm built for the camera. Really it's my trauma of my mother turning me on, and turning me off.” As the makeup demonstration went on, Pressure became increasingly convinced it was evidence that she was unacceptable and unlovable. “They made me feel like I needed to cover up, like what I had was wrong, like my complexion was wrong,” she recalls. “The more makeup I put on, the more I didn't look like myself. And I took it as my mother thinks I'm ugly, like I have to cover this up.” From then on, Pressure's relationship with makeup was fraught, to say the least. That was until a chance encounter with one of her castmates, Perka $exx, changed everything for her — by watching the drag king perform in a full face of makeup and expressing a kind of freedom that Pressure craved. Matt Shaw “Back in the day, we had drag kings, but we didn't call it drag. We just, like, sing a song so you can get the girl at the club, like it wasn't a thing,” says Pressure. But then Perka took to the stage. “The way Perka moved and the art [of] his makeup... it wasn't that he was trying to be like, 'I'm ugly, I need to cover up.' It was like he was pushing the art out,” explains Pressure. “I was like, that's it. I don't know exactly what it is, but I need to know what that is, because it was just an aura of freedom that was coming off of him.” It would be a while before Pressure fully realized that “aura of freedom” for herself, but it happened one night when heartbreak over splitting from her mentor led her to perform her rawest number yet. “I was just so heartbroken. And I was listening to gospel at the time, and it was just like every time I heard it, I would just cry, like every time I just it,” so at an event called Mug Check, Pressure brought that energy to the stage. “[I put on] the most regular outfit: black button down, black pants with a robe, like the choir robe,” she recounts. “Everything started at the stairs and came down and had a whole choir behind me, and I just remember, like I looked up... and I felt that freedom that Perka had.” “It felt bigger than me. Felt bigger than the pain. It was my freedom,” she says. “It was the first time I felt like I was able to breathe since me and my wife got married.” When asked if drag is how they bypass some of the trauma when those old patterns of emotional repression arise, Pressure K is adamant, “Yes, it's the cheat code,” she says. Pressure had a similar revelation this week during the horror challenge that saw the king donning a robe again, this time with words emblazoned on it that represented all the dark influences that surround him. “This challenge was triggering,” Pressure says with a laugh. “I thought it was one thing, but it really was deeper.” Scott Youngblood...","Last week's episode of saw Pressure K leaving alongside Alexander the Great in a heartbreaking double elimination.

Desde bebidas gaseosas y calzado hasta fragancias, a lo largo de los años los famosos han vendido de todo. En el pasado, la mayoría de las estrellas se conformaban con prestar sus rostros a campañas publicitarias a cambio de un poco de dinero extra. Algunos más emprendedores fueron un paso más allá y participaban en el diseño de los productos que promocionaban. En los años 80, un encuentro casual en un avión entre Jane Birkin, actriz británica, y un alto ejecutivo de Hermès, una marca de lujo, dio lugar a la creación del bolso Birkin. Por la misma época, Michael Jordan, la estrella del basquetbol, se asoció con Nike, una marca deportiva, para lanzar la línea de zapatillas deportivas Air Jordan. Sin embargo, más recientemente un número creciente de famosos ha optado por crear empresas de consumo propias. En la última década, los famosos, desde Beyoncé y Rihanna hasta George Clooney y Harry Styles, han lanzado líneas de belleza, marcas de bebidas alcohólicas, de ropa y mucho más. Un estudio realizado en 2023 por la empresa inmobiliaria JLL reveló que alrededor de tres quintas partes de las marcas minoristas de famosos en Estados Unidos se habían fundado en los seis años anteriores. Desde entonces, la tendencia ha continuado a buen ritmo, con la participación de estrellas como Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (cuidado de la piel masculina) y Emma Watson (ginebra), sir David Beckham (suplementos) y Wiz Khalifa (kits para cultivar setas). En mayo, Hailey Bieber, esposa de Justin Bieber, estrella del pop, vendió su marca de maquillaje Rhode a la firma de cosméticos e.l.f. Beauty por nada menos que US$ 1,000 millones. A medida que se difumina la frontera entre el comercio minorista y las redes sociales, los famosos están remodelando el mundo de los bienes de consumo. La proliferación de marcas de famosos es en parte un reflejo de los cambios en la industria de los medios de comunicación. En décadas pasadas, comunicarse con los consumidores estaba intermediado en gran medida por un puñado de canales de televisión, emisoras de radio y publicaciones impresas. Ya no. Hoy en día, dice Douglas Holt, un gurú de la mercadotecnia, cada cuenta de las redes sociales es un canal propio. Esto ha permitido a los famosos relacionarse directamente con sus fans. Kim Kardashian tiene más de 350 millones de seguidores en Instagram. A menudo usa Skims y habla de ellos en línea. “Kim es una directora creativa fenomenal”, dice Jens Grede, su cofundador, “pero también es una potencia mediática en solitario”. Según Launchmetrics, una empresa de análisis, el año pasado Skims generó más de US$ 600 millones en “valor de impacto mediático”, un indicador del beneficio monetario de las publicaciones online, la cobertura de prensa y otros tipos de exposición mediática. Esta cifra es ocho veces superior a la de Spanx, una marca rival de ropa moldeadora. Ahora los famosos no solo pueden comunicarse directamente con sus admiradores. También pueden venderles directamente. Las marcas emergentes ya no necesitan vender a través de grandes minoristas, que se llevan una parte de los beneficios, ni abrir tiendas físicas, lo que supone una enorme inversión inicial. Para vender en línea, ni siquiera necesitan pasar por plataformas de comercio electrónico como Amazon. Las herramientas como las que ofrece Shopify, una empresa de software canadiense, han facilitado más que nunca la creación de un sitio de comercio electrónico o una aplicación móvil. Las plataformas de redes sociales como TikTok también permiten ahora a las marcas vender directamente a los usuarios. Las ventas directas al consumidor han aumentado hasta representar alrededor de una séptima parte del comercio electrónico mundial, según NIQ, un proveedor de datos. Anita Balchandani, de la consultora McKinsey, calcula que representan hasta el 100% de los ingresos en los primeros días de una marca típica de famosos, y que descienden al 30%-60% a medida que las empresas se expanden y añaden la distribución por terceros. Por supuesto, no todas las marcas de famosos despegan. The Honest Company, fabricante de productos de belleza y para bebés cofundada por la actriz Jessica Alba, ha perdido tres cuartas partes de su valor de mercado desde que cotizó en bolsa en 2021. Alex Griffin, jefe de mercadotecnia de On, una marca de ropa deportiva que visten el tenista Roger Federer y la actriz Zendaya, dice que hay una razón por la que muchas estrellas siguen optando por los patrocinios en lugar de crear sus propias marcas: “No es tan fácil”. Elegir el tipo de producto adecuado es importante. La ropa y la bebida son cosas que la gente suele comprar por lo que simbolizan, más que por su funcionalidad, dice Sandra Cariglio, de ReD Associates, una empresa de asesoría. Eso los convierte en apuestas más seguras para los famosos. Naturalmente, a las estrellas atractivas también les resulta fácil vender productos de belleza. Ayuda que la producción de cosméticos sea fácil de subcontratar a fabricantes de marca blanca, como ocurre con las fragancias. Jill Avery, de la Harvard Business School, añade que los productos tienen que “encajar” con la propia marca del famoso. Las fans compran maquillaje a Hailey Bieber porque lleva mucho tiempo compartiendo consejos de belleza en Internet, y ropa moldeadora a Kim Kardashian porque es conocida por sus curvas. Cuando se le pregunta por qué lanza una aplicación para correr, Mo Farah, atleta con cuatro medallas de oro olímpicas a sus espaldas, dice sencillamente a The Economist: “Es lo único que sé”. Aun así, algunos famosos parecen capaces de vender cualquier cosa. Ryan Reynolds, estrella de comedias románticas convertido en superhéroe malhablado, se convirtió en 2019 en el rostro de Mint Mobile, una empresa de telecomunicaciones, tras adquirir alrededor del 25% del negocio. El año pasado, T-Mobile, un rival mayor, compró la empresa matriz de Mint por unos US$ 1,300 millones. En 2021, Reynolds se hizo con el Wrexham A.F.C., un equipo de fútbol galés en apuros, por 2 millones de libras (US$ 2.7 millones) junto con otro actor. La mejora en los resultados del equipo —y un documental ganador de un premio Emmy coproducido por Reynolds— han aumentado considerablemente su fama.

mov_DC94EA846D6FCA5D7C6F8B6307A2776E,"  Ulta Beauty's new chief executive officer Kecia Steelman continues to make significant moves, this time snapping up Space NK from investment firm Manzanita Capital. Terms of the deal were not disclosed apart from that the purchase was funded with cash on hand and capacity under Ulta's existing credit facility. More from WWD Press reports from last year suggested Manzanita was searching for a deal valued between 300 million pounds and 400 million pounds. Space NK, which has 83 stores in the U.K. and Ireland, will operate as a stand-alone subsidiary of Ulta Beauty and will continue to be led by its existing management team, including CEO Andy Lightfoot. “Today's announcement marks an exciting step forward for Ulta Beauty's global expansion efforts, adding the U.K. market to our existing planned openings in Mexico and the Middle East later this year,” said Steelman. “Space NK is a beloved brand with a strong operating model and customer loyalty, and we couldn't be more thrilled to welcome the brand into the Ulta Beauty family.” Space NK was founded in Covent Garden in 1993 by Nicky Kinnaird as a glossy destination for niche, international brands — many of them skin care — that were difficult to find in the U.K. It had been part of Manzanita Capital for 23 years. Reports that the firm was trying to sell Space NK emerged in April 2024. It previously tried to off-load it in 2018, before deciding to pull the retailer off the market. Bill Fisher, CEO and founder of Manzanita Capital, said: “I have every confidence that Ulta Beauty and this terrific management team will take Space NK to new heights.” Lightfoot added that he was excited by the opportunity to join Ulta Beauty and “benefit from its scale, brand relationships and resources.” “This acquisition sets both companies on a path to further success and importantly, enables us to reach more beauty enthusiasts throughout the world at scale. As a collective force of talented, passionate teams, I'm confident we will take Space NK to new heights,” he continued. The U.S. wholesale division of Space NK, which entails roughly 600 points of distribution across Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, Hudson's Bay and the company's shop-in-shop collaboration with Walmart and Beauty SpaceNK, was acquired by PCA Companies in June 2024. Since taking the reins as CEO of Ulta at the beginning of this year, Steelman has been executing its international expansion. Later this year Ulta will debut in Mexico through a joint venture with Axo, before arriving in the Middle East via a licensing agreement with Alshaya Group. In the Middle East, the first locations will be in Dubai and Kuwait City, with one store in each location to begin with, although the strategy is to expand quickly. It's the same story in Mexico. “We're getting ready to launch in the back half of 2025 for Mexico, and it will probably be in the later half of the year for the Middle East. For Mexico, it's a joint venture with Axo. We're very excited about our partnership. The teams are working very well together. We believe we can get 10 stores open in a pretty short period of time,” Steelman said during an April interview with WWD. “In regards to the Middle East, that's actually a licensed agreement that we're doing with Alshaya Group. We've talked to Alshaya Group for quite some time, and feel like they're a fantastic partner for us to bring our brand to life in the Middle East.” Thursday's announcement that Ulta is acquiring Spake NK is yet another sign that beauty M&A is picking up after a lengthy slowdown. Other recent deals include L'Oréal snapping up Medik8 and Color Wow, E.l.f. Beauty buying Hailey Bieber's Rhode and Unilever's purchase of Dr. Squatch. Other beauty brands that have been in the market for some time will no doubt be hoping that this thawing means they will soon have some success. Best of WWD Sign up for WWD's Newsletter.

While technology stocks get a lot of attention, and deservedly so, the consumer space is also full of solid companies with long growth trajectories. Here's a look at five consumer-focused stocks built for growth to buy and hold for the the long haul. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue » Amazon There is a reason why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) The company is using AI to predict the best routes and even to make it easier for drivers to navigate complex drop-offs at places like large apartment buildings. It's also using AI to predict the best warehouses to store items in order to reduce shipping mileage and times. On top of that, it has invested heavily in robots, that with advancements in AI are now able to take on increasingly complex tasks. Its robots aren't just moving boxes and lifting heavy items, some have a sense of touch and can grab items in tough-to-reach places and others can spot damaged items, helping the company save money on costly returns. At the same time, Amazon continues to be a cloud computing leader with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has created software tools that make it easy for developers to build and deploy AI models and tools, while the company has also developed its own proprietary chips for AI training and inference that give it a cost advantage over off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs). Put it all together, and Amazon is building one of the most powerful and defensible platforms on the planet. e.l.f. Beauty e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) Rhode brings with it higher price points and a strong skincare portfolio. That complements e.l.f.'s mass-market cosmetic lines and opens up cross-sell opportunities, as it's common in the beauty industry for consumers to use both prestige and mass products. Meanwhile, Hailey Bieber will stay on as chief creative officer, and e.l.f. will surely want to ramp up Rhode's product offerings. E.l.f. has already shown it knows how to gain share in a crowded market. It continues to expand internationally, and it should have opportunities in other adjacent markets down the road, like fragrance. With its brand-building track record and influencer marketing, e.l.f. has plenty of growth ahead. Dutch Bros One of the best themes to invest in in the consumer space is expansion, and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) The company just rolled out mobile ordering, which should boost throughput, and it is finally looking to roll out more food options, an area where it's been notably absent. Breakfast is a massive category, and Dutch Bros has acknowledged that not offering food items during this important daypart has likely cost it sales. If its food pilot proves successful, it could be a significant driver of same-store growth. Between new food offerings and expansion, this is a stock to own for the long haul. Cava Group Another great restaurant expansion story in progress right now is Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) The introduction of grilled steak to its menu last year was a game changer, and its menu continues to evolve and improve. Its added higher-margin items like fresh juices, and add-ons are already boosting average tickets. Cava is also experimenting with new dishes and a loyalty program to keep customers coming back. The big story, though, is still geographic expansion. With under 400 locations at the end of last quarter and a target of 1,000 by 2032, Cava's growth runway is wide open. Its ""coastal smile "" expansion strategy has worked well, and now it's starting to enter major Midwest markets like Chicago and Detroit. Cava has plenty of growth in front of it. Philip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) Zyn has become the breakout nicotine pouch brand in the U.S., with volumes up over 50% last quarter. The company acquired the brand when it bought Swedish Match in 2022, in what has to be one of the best deals in the consumer space over the past several years. Meanwhile, Iqos continues to take share overseas, especially in Europe and Japan, and is making inroads in newer markets like Mexico City and Jakarta. The company also bought back the U.S. rights to Iqos, giving it another potential growth driver in one of the world's biggest markets. At the same time, Philip Morris still runs a profitable legacy cigarette business overseas, where pricing remains strong and volumes are more stable. Importantly, the company typically uses local manufacturing, including with Zyn, meaning it faces little tariff risk. All in all, Philip Morris is a great growth stock in a defensive industry.

Years of heavy investment in logistics and automation continue to pay off, and  artificial intelligence (AI) is only making the company more efficient. The company has built out a regionalized fulfillment network designed to cut shipping distances and reduce costs, and now it is using AI to enhance this even more.

Beauty (NYSE: ELF) already rewrote the playbook on mass-market cosmetics, taking massive share over the past few years. Now, the company is going the premium route with its acquisition of Rhode, and the upside is substantial. Rhode has grown to $212 million in sales over the past year with minimal distribution and almost no paid marketing. Plug that into e.l.f.'s distribution network, which includes strong relationships with retailers like Ulta Beauty and Target, and it should be able to take the brand to new heights. Rhode brings with it higher price points and a strong skincare portfolio. That complements e.l.f.'s mass-market cosmetic lines and opens up cross-sell opportunities, as it's common in the beauty industry for consumers to use both prestige and mass products.

Dutch Bros One of the best themes to invest in in the consumer space is expansion, and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) has a big opportunity in front of it. The company now has over 1,000 locations and a clear roadmap to grow that to 7,000 over time. But this isn't just an expansion story, as Dutch Bros is also seeing strong traction with same-store sales, which climbed 4.7% last quarter.

The company is replicating what Chipotle Mexican Grill did a decade ago with Tex-Mex, but with Mediterranean food. Its Mediterranean-focused menu is fresh, healthy, and customizable, and consumers are responding. The company has posted four straight quarters of double-digit same-store sales growth, including a 10.8% gain last quarter, powered largely by a 7.5% jump in traffic.

mov_375B9C3BE50E1BBF867262DFC772576F,"  Key Points There are a number of companies that are well positioned to deliver solid revenue and earnings growth over the next several years. Here are five monster stocks to buy right now and hold for the next five years or more. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue » 1. Amazon While Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Another behind-the-scenes area where Amazon is a market leader is robotics. The company is the world's largest operator of mobile robots, having just deployed its millionth robot, which is working at one of its fulfillment centers. These robots aren't just moving boxes, they are detecting damaged goods, navigating tight aisles, and even fixing themselves. Meanwhile, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model to coordinate the movement of its entire fleet of robots in order to save time and boost throughput. The company is also using AI to create better delivery routes and make it easier for drivers to find difficult drop-off locations within large apartment or office complexes. All of this is making Amazon more efficient and should lead to strong earnings growth in the years ahead. 2. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) However, the company's bigger opportunity lies in custom AI chips. Broadcom helped Alphabet design its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and now it has multiple customers developing their own custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These chips can offer better efficiency and performance than off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs), and Broadcom has become the primary partner for several top tech companies that are creating their own custom AI ASICs. Broadcom estimates that its three customers furthest along in their development could each deploy 1 million AI chip clusters by fiscal 2027, representing a $60 billion to $90 billion total serviceable addressable market. That's a big potential growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead. 3. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) At the same time, Meta's new AI tools are improving both ad creativity and targeting, leading to better ad performance. Last quarter, ad impressions rose 5% while average price per ad jumped 10%, demonstrating that its platform is becoming more effective for marketers. In addition, Meta has two new monetization opportunities emerging. The company just started serving ads on its popular messaging platform, WhatsApp, which boasts more than 3 billion users. At the same time, it's also begun to gradually serve ads to its new social media platform Threads, which had more than 350 million monthly users as of last quarter and is growing quickly. Between the better monetization of its core platforms and new opportunities with WhatsApp and Threads, Meta has a solid growth outlook over the next several years. 4. Philip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) Internationally, Iqos is gaining strong traction. The company sold more than 37 billion heated tobacco units last quarter, with strong growth in Japan and Europe. Philip Morris recently regained U.S. rights to Iqos and is piloting it in Austin, Texas. Once the FDA clears its latest device, a broader U.S. rollout could begin. Best of all, this would not cannibalize existing sales, since Philip Morris doesn't sell cigarettes in the U.S. What really sets these products apart, though, are their unit economics. Zyn is 6 times more profitable than traditional cigarettes, while Iqos is more than twice as profitable. In addition, Philip Morris tends to use local manufacturing, which shields it from any tariffs. With global cigarette sales still holding up outside the U.S., Philip Morris is a rare growth stock in a defensive industry. 5. E.l.f. Beauty E.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) Rhode was already set to expand into Sephora stores this year, and e.l.f. has strong relationships with retailers Ulta Beauty and Target. Increased distribution is one of the surest ways to increase growth, and e.l.f. will have a long runway of getting Rhode products onto retail shelfs. The deal also diversifies e.l.f. into prestige skincare and cosmetics, complementing its mass-market cosmetics base. That should boost margins and expand its reach to a slightly more affluent demographic. While the company will face tariff headwinds, the Rhode deal should help power strong growth in the years ahead.

These robots aren't just moving boxes, they are detecting damaged goods, navigating tight aisles, and even fixing themselves. Meanwhile, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model to coordinate the movement of its entire fleet of robots in order to save time and boost throughput. The company is also using AI to create better delivery routes and make it easier for drivers to find difficult drop-off locations within large apartment or office complexes. All of this is making Amazon more efficient and should lead to strong earnings growth in the years ahead. 2. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) However, the company's bigger opportunity lies in custom AI chips. Broadcom helped Alphabet design its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and now it has multiple customers developing their own custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These chips can offer better efficiency and performance than off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs), and Broadcom has become the primary partner for several top tech companies that are creating their own custom AI ASICs. Broadcom estimates that its three customers furthest along in their development could each deploy 1 million AI chip clusters by fiscal 2027, representing a $60 billion to $90 billion total serviceable addressable market. That's a big potential growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead. 3. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) At the same time, Meta's new AI tools are improving both ad creativity and targeting, leading to better ad performance. Last quarter, ad impressions rose 5% while average price per ad jumped 10%, demonstrating that its platform is becoming more effective for marketers. In addition, Meta has two new monetization opportunities emerging. The company just started serving ads on its popular messaging platform, WhatsApp, which boasts more than 3 billion users. At the same time, it's also begun to gradually serve ads to its new social media platform Threads, which had more than 350 million monthly users as of last quarter and is growing quickly. Between the better monetization of its core platforms and new opportunities with WhatsApp and Threads, Meta has a solid growth outlook over the next several years. 4. Philip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) Internationally, Iqos is gaining strong traction. The company sold more than 37 billion heated tobacco units last quarter, with strong growth in Japan and Europe. Philip Morris recently regained U.S. rights to Iqos and is piloting it in Austin, Texas. Once the FDA clears its latest device, a broader U.S. rollout could begin. Best of all, this would not cannibalize existing sales, since Philip Morris doesn't sell cigarettes in the U.S. What really sets these products apart, though, are their unit economics. Zyn is 6 times more profitable than traditional cigarettes, while Iqos is more than twice as profitable. In addition, Philip Morris tends to use local manufacturing, which shields it from any tariffs. With global cigarette sales still holding up outside the U.S., Philip Morris is a rare growth stock in a defensive industry. 5. E.l.f. Beauty E.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) Rhode was already set to expand into Sephora stores this year, and e.l.f. has strong relationships with retailers Ulta Beauty and Target. Increased distribution is one of the surest ways to increase growth, and e.l.f. will have a long runway of getting Rhode products onto retail shelfs. The deal also diversifies e.l.f. into prestige skincare and cosmetics, complementing its mass-market cosmetics base. That should boost margins and expand its reach to a slightly more affluent demographic. While the company will face tariff headwinds, the Rhode deal should help power strong growth in the years ahead.

Amazon While Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a leader in e-commerce and  cloud computing, what it is doing behind the scenes is the best reason to own the stock. At its cloud computing division, the company is helping customers customize, build, and deploy their own artificial intelligence (AI) models and tools through its Bedrock and SageMaker platforms and then run them on its infrastructure. But it goes beyond that, with Amazon having developed its own custom chips for AI training and inference, giving it a cost advantage.

Its portfolio of networking components -- which consists of Ethernet switches, digital signal processing, network interface cards,and optical receivers -- is needed for moving data across massive AI clusters. Last quarter, the company saw a 70% jump in AI networking revenue. However, the company's bigger opportunity lies in custom AI chips.

Zyn nicotine pouches are exploding in popularity in the U.S., with shipments up 53% last quarter.

The “All About That Bass” singer, 31, shared on the July 10th episode of her podcast, Workin' On, that she caught a bug that went through her family — that's puzzlingly enough making her tongue burn. “I'm sick,” she said. “Yet again, but I'm not on antibiotics. I'm gonna fight it.” She then shared son Riley, 4, was the first to get sick, before the illness spread to husband Daryl Sabara, and then youngest son Barry, 2. “I have it because I just got sick, and then, I should get sick again,” she explained, her voice raspy. ” And my tongue is still burning.

It's a symptom of the mysterious burning mouth syndrome, which the Mayo Clinic explains is a painful sensation inside the mouth that doesn't have an obvious cause, but symptoms are similar to the burn felt after drinking a hot beverage. Trainor, who recently launched a “Cloud Skin” makeup collab with e.l.f.

So, you'll heal right up.' And I'm like, 'I'm on day three. So, when's the healing right up going to happen?' Little concerned, a little worried,” she said. Oral rinses and mouthwashes can help numb the symptoms, the Mayo Clinic says, along with nerve blockers and other types of medications to relieve pain.

mov_BED03247F68E24FB04A2E7D930FE3443,"  Is it finally clocking to you? Justin Bieber is back. The 31-year-old singer surprise-released a new album, ""Swag,"" Friday after teasing fans the previous morning with a series of billboards and social media posts. Bieber's first album since 2021's ""Justice,"" the new music prompted an online frenzy and revived a devoted community of Beliebers. From his marriage to his paparazzi encounters, Bieber has faced incredible scrutiny over the last few months, which he addresses head-on in ""Swag."" After listening to all 21 tracks, here are our biggest takeaways. Bieber has incorporated R&B elements in his music since early in his career and embraced the genre fully on the 2013 compilation album ""Journals."" But even after coining R&Bieber in 2019, he's struggled to be taken seriously. When 2020's ""Changes"" received a Grammy nomination for pop vocal album, Bieber expressed his confusion at not being nominated in the R&B category. ""To the Grammys I am flattered to be acknowledged and appreciated for my artistry. I am very meticulous and intentional about my music. With that being said I set out to make an R&B album. ' Changes' was and is an R&B album,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""It is not being acknowledged as an R&B album which is very strange to me. I grew up admiring R&B music and wished to make a project that would embody that sound."" ""To be clear I absolutely love Pop music,"" he added. ""It just wasn't what I set out to make this time around. My gratitude for feeling respected for my work remains and I am honored to be nominated either way."" On ""Swag,"" Bieber shows off his R&B chops. From opening track ""All I Can Take"" and the seemingly SZA-inspired ""Yukon"" to ""Daisies"" (which reportedly features Mk.gee on the guitar), he takes a more intimate approach than on previous albums. But still, longtime fans will hear hints of ""Journals"" and ""Changes"" throughout the project. In one of the album's unconventional moments, comedian Druski comments on Bieber's more ""soulful,"" R&B-infused sound. ""I said this album kinda sound, you got some soul on this album too, bro,"" he says on the interlude track ""Soulful."" ""Your skin white but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you, man."" Since Justin and Hailey Bieber wed in 2018, their marriage has been under a microscope. Divorce rumors circulated within months of them tying the knot, and it didn't help that many fans were still rooting for the singer to get back with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. Bieber's love for his wife is evident throughout his catalog - from 2020's ""All Around Me"" to 2021's ""Hailey."" But in case anyone is still skeptical (they are), Bieber sets the record straight on ""Swag."" On album standout ""Walking Away,"" Bieber gets candid about his relationship troubles but also reaffirms that he's committed to his marriage. ""You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,"" he sings. Elsewhere on the album, he cheers on his wife. On ""Go Baby"" (which lyrically echoes 2021's ""There She Go""), he sings, ""That's my baby, she's iconic, iPhone case, lip gloss on it"" - a reference to the Rhode founder's famous lip gloss-holder phone case. Recently, Hailey sold her skin-care company, which she launched in 2022, to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion. There she goes indeed. The Biebers' pregnancy announcement in May 2024 was accompanied by an unknown instrumental track. Now, fans have identified it as ""Devotion"" featuring Dijon. On the heartwarming track, Bieber sings, ""When your lips and fingernails are all mine / I promise to take my time givin' you devotion."" The singer also celebrates being a father to Jack Blues Bieber, born Aug. 23, 2024, on ""Dadz Love."" As rapper Lil B declares we need ""less hatin'"" and ""more love,"" Bieber repeats the track title (which sounds like ""that's love"") over and over. Soon after the singer announced the surprise album, fans flocked to social media to express their excitement. ""New album - bieber fever hitting like it's 2010,"" TikTok user @jennyboba posted to the will.i.am collab ""#thatPOWER."" ""Justin Bieber is back… I used to pray for times like this,"" singer d4vd posted on X. Others reactivated their old X fan accounts and created group chats to celebrate the release. ""We're creating a SWAG group chat to keep up with all the updates! Like or reply so I can add you,"" @statsonbieber announced in a post that's since received almost 6,000 likes and more than 600 comments. Bieber fever may have been latent for years, but it's making the rounds once again. Bieber's had his fair share of viral paparazzi moments over the past year. Most notable was his encounter with photographers while leaving Malibu's SoHo House, when he declared, ""It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business.""

mov_D5FEC779BDAD6833F99FFF8611E5032B,"  Is it finally clocking to you? Justin Bieber is back. The 31-year-old singer surprise-released a new album, “Swag,” Friday after teasing fans the previous morning with a series of billboards and social media posts. Bieber's first album since 2021's “Justice,” the new music prompted an online frenzy and revived a devoted community of Beliebers. From his marriage to his paparazzi encounters, Bieber has faced incredible scrutiny over the last few months, which he addresses head-on in ""Swag."" After listening to all 21 tracks, here are our biggest takeaways. R&Bieber is back Bieber has incorporated R&B elements in his music since early in his career and embraced the genre fully on the 2013 compilation album “Journals.” But even after coining R&Bieber in 2019, he's struggled to be taken seriously. When 2020's “Changes” received a Grammy nomination for pop vocal album, Bieber expressed his confusion at not being nominated in the R&B category. “To the Grammys I am flattered to be acknowledged and appreciated for my artistry. I am very meticulous and intentional about my music. With that being said I set out to make an R&B album. ' Changes' was and is an R&B album,” he wrote on Instagram. “It is not being acknowledged as an R&B album which is very strange to me. I grew up admiring R&B music and wished to make a project that would embody that sound.” “To be clear I absolutely love Pop music,"" he added. "" It just wasn't what I set out to make this time around. My gratitude for feeling respected for my work remains and I am honored to be nominated either way.” On “Swag,” Bieber shows off his R&B chops. From opening track “All I Can Take” and the seemingly SZA-inspired “Yukon” to “Daisies” (which reportedly features Mk.gee on the guitar), he takes a more intimate approach than on previous albums. But still, longtime fans will hear hints of “Journals” and “Changes” throughout the project. In one of the album's unconventional moments, comedian Druski comments on Bieber's more “soulful,” R&B-infused sound. “I said this album kinda sound, you got some soul on this album too, bro,” he says on the interlude track “Soulful.” “Your skin white but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you, man.” He's not 'Walking Away' from his marriage Since Justin and Hailey Bieber wed in 2018, their marriage has been under a microscope. Divorce rumors circulated within months of them tying the knot, and it didn't help that many fans were still rooting for the singer to get back with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. Bieber's love for his wife is evident throughout his catalog — from 2020's “All Around Me” to 2021's “Hailey.” But in case anyone is still skeptical (they are), Bieber sets the record straight on “Swag.” On album standout “Walking Away,” Bieber gets candid about his relationship troubles but also reaffirms that he's committed to his marriage. “You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,” he sings.

mov_CBF88DB5433CA59566B26443100647CD,"  Justin Bieber has reportedly settled with Scooter Braun, his former manager, for $31.5 million over their financial dispute regarding the pop star's canceled ""Justice Tour"" and alleged unpaid commissions. This news came amid the release of the pop singer's seventh studio album, , on July 11, 2025. On July 10, 2025, TMZ reported that Bieber and Braun reached a $31.5 million settlement regarding their financial dispute. News of Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun reportedly settling their financial dispute was met with mixed reactions from netizens on X, with one user accusing the former manager of robbing Bieber. ""So scooter robbed justin, disgusting, karma is coming."" liv @grandesnasaso scooter robbed justin, disgusting, karma is coming Several netizens agreed with this sentiment, claiming Braun was a ""fake friend"" to Bieber. ""That person should change their name to scooter robber,"" one person tweeted. ""All my homies hate scooter braun,"" another person added. ""That's when you know there are no friends in the music business…Braun always acted like he was Justin's friend and cared for him…but once it affected his pockets all that fake friendship went out the window… and we all saw the medical issues that made Justin cancel the tour,"" someone else commented. ""Scooter deserves no more money after this,"" another user said. Others speculated whether the pop star's wife, Hailey Bieber, was instrumental in settling the debt. For context, Hailey sold her beauty brand, Rhode, to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion in late May 2025. ""Hailey helped him pay the debt by selling her company,"" one person speculated. ""I bet that was Hailey's Rhode money,"" another person added. ""That rhode money is gonna last nothing at this point,"" someone else commented. ""Hence the lovely posts with wifey! Women always save the day smh,"" another user wrote. Exploring Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun's financial dispute The financial dispute between Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun began in 2022, while the singer was on his ""Justice Tour"" to promote his sixth studio album. For the uninitiated, Bieber reportedly received a $40 million advance from Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), which is Live Nation's parent company, for his ""Justice Tour"" in 2022. However, the singer canceled most of the tour in 2023 due to a health condition (he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome) and was asked to pay back $26 million of the advance to AEG. According to TMZ, Scooter Braun, who was Bieber's manager at the time, shouldered the payment through his company Hybe, with the pop star promising to pay Hybe and Braun back in installments over the next 10 years. Justin Bieber reportedly paid just one installment and stopped. However, recent reports indicate that Bieber and Braun have settled the payment, which also included an additional clause requiring Bieber to pay half of the $11 million that he allegedly owed Braun in unpaid commissions, bringing the total to $31.5 million. As per the TMZ report, this does not include the additional $8.6 million that Bieber allegedly owed Braun in further unpaid commissions, which the former manager waived. There have been multiple reports of Justin Bieber's alleged financial struggles, which many believe contributed to the singer selling his 291-song catalogue to Hipgnosis Songs Capital in December 2022 for $200 million. A TMZ documentary released in May 2025, titled alleged that the singer “had to sell his music catalog because he was broke.” “I was on a call with multiple people — Justin's side acknowledges that in 2022, he was on the verge of… the words were 'financial collapse.' And that's why he had to sell his catalog,” TMZ executive producer Levin says in the documentary. However, Justin Bieber has denied all rumors of his alleged financial troubles, with his representative telling The Hollywood Reporter in April 2025: “Any source that is trying to sell you a story about alleged financial distress … either doesn't understand the entertainment industry or, more likely, is trying to paint an unflattering portrait of Justin, which bears no resemblance to reality.” As per Celebrity Net Worth, Justin Bieber's net worth is reportedly $200 million as of July 2025. In other news, Justin Bieber surprised fans after he released his new album, , on July 11 with minimal promotion. The 21-track album reportedly features artists like Cash Cobain, Gunna, and Druski.

The surprise album dropped on Friday, July 11, and features 21 songs. 'SWAG' quickly raced to #1 on Spotify and Apple's music charts. Several reports suggest it could secure 150,000 to 175,000 album equivalent units during its debut week. Morgan Wallen's 'I'm the Problem' dominates America's album chart. It has been at No.1 on the Billboard 200 for two months! Two songs on the album, 'Daisies' and 'All I Can Take', are also set for a big first week. 'Daisies' scored #1 on Spotify's U.S. and Global Song Debut charts while 'All I Can Take' claimed the #1 spot on Apple Music Song Debut charts. Several songs from the album will likely make it onto the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart, but it remains to be seen which one will top the chart. Alex Warren's 'Ordinary' is currently at #1.

1m05fj8,"  **Note: I have already posted this in another makeup subreddit but barely got any advice. I'm hoping posting it here may help… I turn red in the face and I'm struggling to cover it up properly and effectively. So, for some context as to how this began: I started a medication last Christmas and with every medication comes their side effects as most would know. I didn't know that my medication would stop me from sweating as it was always cold in the house because it was winter, but once it started getting warmer, my face would turn red often even from the littlest bit of warmth. And I know some might say that's normal and unavoidable, but I've never had it happen as often and as severe as this. In previous years, including last year, my cheeks were the only part on my face that would frequently turn red from warmth. Nowadays, my medication causes my face to turn red when I'm even just a little bit too warm. The only way to help battle the redness without makeup (and also because I'm literally too overheated to function) is to cool myself down with air conditioning because nothing else helps. The reason I'm making this post is because I have been struggling with makeup lately to help cover up my redness (oftentimes before it happens), especially when I'm leaving the house. I've never turned this red before, and even if I did, it was usually only on my cheeks, not my entire face like it is nowadays thanks to the medication… I have dry and sensitive skin, and not a lot of products have worked for me, but for a couple months now, I have been using Jason Wu's Tinted Moisturizer Meets CC Cream and it's been the best base makeup product I've used in years! I've also switched from putting the green shade from the NYX Color Corrector palette all over my face (exhausting because it takes forever to work into the skin) to recently using Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (because I use their normal Age Rewind Concealer and I've loved it since forever). I have also purchased the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer since someone I know recommended it for my situation, but I haven't tried it yet since I don't understand how it helps… And no, this post isn't just me rambling about my struggles with makeup. I'm here asking for help from those who may have experience with these products, this situation, or those who have professional makeup advice for me. There's a few issues I've been having with my makeup lately: 1. I've found that sometimes touching my face will take my tinted moisturizer right off, or if my nail presses ever so slightly onto my skin, that it'll remove the makeup in that exact area. I've tried to combat this by setting my face with the only setting powder I own, which is one from E.L.F. I just don't remember the name. I've only done this method once and it seemed to have helped but I'm unsure about how much it helped. 2. If I don't apply enough of my chosen colour corrector (remember, I still haven't tried the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer yet) underneath my tinted moisturizer, then my redness will shine through later on and it makes me feel horrible about myself (I know many people have rosacea and other skin conditions that can cause mass redness, but I'm just remaining honest on how my type of redness makes me feel, so please don't take any offence as I don't mean any…). 3. To conclude this, I'm also heavily struggling with how to make this whole process simpler and less stress-inducing because I'm oftentimes trying to cover my redness before it actually appears, so I cannot tell how much green will help combat the red. Sometimes I've used too little and later my redness peeked through my makeup, or I've used too much and I've had to put on a lot of tinted moisturizer to cover it. It was also my first time using setting powder because I was scared it would cause me to dry out because of my skin type. I just need some advice… If anyone has any questions regarding what I mentioned, then please ask. I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions from anyone who is familiar with this or knows, professionally, how to help. I'm also on a tight budget as I barely make any money nowadays, so purchasing luxury beauty products or pricy items is something I'd very much like to avoid unless there's no other way. Sorry for this jumble of stuff. I've just been so frustrated lately and I've gotten very tired of spending a lot of time looking up how to help with these things and coming up with nothing, either because the advice found didn't help or wasn't the right solution to my problem. Thank you. ***TL;DR: I've been turning red in the face from a medication I take that stops me from sweating (meaning I cannot cool myself down). I'm struggling to both cover this up and maintain my makeup without it smudging off or rubbing off by a small tap to the face.","**Note: I have already posted this in another makeup subreddit but barely got any advice.

It sent SPF into the middle of the Pacific and trusted the story would take care of itself. That act of unprompted generosity – and restraint – made the response feel genuine. It wasn't influencer content; it was content that happened to feature an influencer. Ceding control to creators emerges as an important factor when building emotional connections on social platforms.

mov_73E4ED1F1427B944611E55FC53EC0880,"  The beauty and personal care landscape continues to grow increasingly competitive in the advent of increased social selling, pushing industry stakeholders to pivot into increasingly creative, innovative efforts to reinvent category offerings. According to the recently released the new report by consumer insight firm NIQ, these efforts are paying dividends: e-commerce drove a 17.4% increase in beauty and health sales in 2024, with online now representing 42% of total category revenue. E-commerce, social selling, and the largest swing in category growth Among the trends tracked in NIQ's report, social media, wellness, personalization, and luxury, social media was highlighted as the most transformative force. “It's not just about visibility; TikTok is becoming a commerce channel itself,” said Anna Mayo, Vice President, Beauty Vertical at NIQ. Through “social selling (especially on TikTok Shop), rapid digital discovery, and retail consolidation around platforms like Amazon,” she told CosmeticsDesign USA, the beauty category has particularly benefited from the growing influence of impulse-driven purchases. As noted in NIQ's report, 68% of social buys are unplanned, with user-generated content as a main driver behind the conversion momentum. Leading beauty brands in this space, Mayo advised, are leveraging building blocks like “experiential digital storytelling, social-first product launches and agile fulfillment across platforms.” For example, brands such as e.l.f., Phlur, and Dove are developing launch strategies specifically tailored for social platforms. “This forces manufacturers to prioritize agility, trend responsiveness, and creator partnerships in product development and marketing,” she said. High-growth segments signal new consumer priorities The fragrance category was a notable outlier, according to the report, with a 20% year-over-year growth rate that was largely driven by viral trends and evolving consumer behavior, especially among Gen Z. For example, Mayo illustrated, “instead of having a signature scent, they are investing in a fragrance wardrobe, with scents for different moods and occasions, that can also be layered together.” Brands that are attuned to the demographic and behavioral shifts like this have responded by expanding hero fragrances into new product formats, such as body care, and intensifying social media campaigns. “With fragrance's emotional and identity-driven appeal, as well as its continued innovation in formats and storytelling, the category is well-positioned for continued growth,” she added. Several other emerging and previously underperforming segments also outpaced expectations in 2024. “Categories like first aid, lip care, and men's body care stood out with high-growth product launches,” she said. Products like Dr. Squatch lip balm and Band-Aid Pro Heal Bandages, for example, reflected a growing demand for “wellness-adjacent personal care” and innovation in functional and inclusive product design. Strategic innovation imperative for 2025 and beyond The impact of brand innovation, which the report noted contributed to nine percent of mass retail beauty sales, cannot be understated, said Mayo. Citing examples like Sol de Janeiro's Rio Deo and SheaMoisture's Even Tone Deodorant as evidence that consumers respond positively to new offerings from trusted brands, the data demonstrated that line extensions have been a successful endeavor for some beauty brands over the past year. “These cases show that consumers gravitate toward familiar, trusted brands offering new formats that match their values, whether that's wellness, inclusivity or luxury feel at mass price points,” she explained. However, she cautioned, while innovation is “a critical driver of brand growth, especially in times of economic uncertainty...the data shows that while line extensions dominate, not all innovation leads to incremental growth, so brands must be diligent in assessing whether new products are additive or potentially cannibalizing existing sales.” Ultimately, she concluded, “success will depend on staying agile, insight-driven, and culturally relevant, developing products that not only meet functional needs but also tap into emerging values and behaviors shaping the future of health and beauty.”","The beauty and personal care landscape continues to grow increasingly competitive in the advent of increased social selling, pushing industry stakeholders to pivot into increasingly creative, innovative efforts to reinvent category offerings.

After you've given it a minute to dry, it lasts all day long and doesn't smudge or fade. It seriously gives the effect of false lashes, without the discomfort."" Promising review: ""After using Lights, Camera, Lashes by Tarte for the past year, I got tired of breaking the bank over mascara. My sister suggested Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect, and I IMMEDIATELY fell in love. It provides dramatic length and great volume. I can honestly say I can't stop looking at my eyelashes in the mirror every single day because of how awesome they look. Also, it is very long-wearing. I go from an eight-hour workday right to the gym and sweat like wild...and this stuff doesn't budge! I love it!!"" —Carrie E Weikert Get it from Amazon for $4.74 (available also in a pack of three). For more info and review pics, check out Kayla's full Essence Lash Princess Mascara review! 3. Milani Conceal + Perfect Smoothing Primer casts a magical soft-focus filter over pores and uneven texture — one that also blurs and brightens. With niacinamide and hyaluronic acid in a whipped souffle-like formula, it ensures smoother makeup application and long-lasting hydration. Promising review: ""This primer is a game changer! It blurs pores, smooths skin, and controls shine without feeling heavy. My makeup stays fresh for hours, and it works great with matte foundations.

mov_0A440AE19F198C9B6A9A0EFFB4306133,"  While most of us ditch our routine in the summer, I think I've found the product that's upped my makeup game Summer is hands down one of my favourite times of the year, mainly because I can skip the makeup routine, especially when a fresh tan gives that perfect sun-kissed glow. But let's be real: for those of us who feel a bit self-conscious about our skin, a little makeup can really help boost confidence while still keeping that holiday radiance alive. As someone with dry skin, finding a primer that doesn't cling to dry patches or add extra texture has always been a struggle. After a lot of trial and error, though, I think I've finally found the one: a lightweight, reliable primer that keeps my makeup in place all day and feels like second skin. Enter the Maybelline Grippy Serum. This product has completely revamped my makeup game, and it's super affordable too. At just £10 on Amazon, the combination of its ultra-blendable formula and Serum-To-Grip technology ensures your makeup stays put for up to 24 hours. It's a water-based primer that feels fresh and lightweight but never greasy, with zero white cast, making it suitable for all skin types. Plus, I find that it hydrates and plumps the skin, which creates the perfect base for makeup. Application is a easy too: simply apply a few drops with the dropper, then gently tap it in with your fingertips or a beauty blender. Within 20 seconds, the serum transforms into a grippy texture. What I love most is that as you apply your foundation, the primer gives your skin a natural, healthy glow, leaving you with a fresh, dewy finish, perfect for those summer nights. With the addition of 2% Niacinamide, it nourishes your skin while locking your makeup in place all day long, so you won't feel like it's just melting off. It's the ideal mix of skincare and makeup in one product. For money-saving tips, sign up to our Money newsletter here Indeed, lots of people on Amazon are finding similar results, with the product securing a strong 4.3 star rating. One customer shared: ""I actually love this, goes on really well and is nice and tacky in minutes. The added benefit of skincare is just an amazing quality. Foundation sits so well on top of this and lasts all day."" However, some people have pointed out that the primer may not be suitable for all, with one person saying: ""Lovely texture for more mature skin, was really excited to try this. Until I realised all of my foundations, tinted moisturisers and cc creams were silicone based and obviously water based primer repels silicone based formulas. So the makeup separated. It clearly says it in the title that it's water based, but I didn't realise that water and silicone don't play well."" If you're also a fan of silicone-based makeup and don't want to overhaul your entire makeup collection, LookFantastic offers the perfect solution: the NYX Professional Makeup Studio Perfect Primer - Clear. Priced at £10.99, this primer helps reduce unwanted shine and control excess oils while smoothing the skin for a flawless make up finish. More along the lines of the Maybelline Grippy Serum is the e.l.f. Power Grip Primer - a must try if you believe all the TikTok hype. Like the Grippy Serum, the formula goes tacky within 30 seconds, ensuring your makeup lasts all day long. Infused with hyaluronic acid, it moisturises, preps and smooths for a plump, flawless complexion. The best part? It's currently on sale at Amazon, dropping from £10 to £7.89.","While most of us ditch our routine in the summer, I think I've found the product that's upped my makeup game Summer is hands down one of my favourite times of the year, mainly because I can skip the makeup routine, especially when a fresh tan gives that perfect sun-kissed glow.

One customer shared: ""I actually love this, goes on really well and is nice and tacky in minutes. The added benefit of skincare is just an amazing quality. Foundation sits so well on top of this and lasts all day."" However, some people have pointed out that the primer may not be suitable for all, with one person saying: ""Lovely texture for more mature skin, was really excited to try this. Until I realised all of my foundations, tinted moisturisers and cc creams were silicone based and obviously water based primer repels silicone based formulas. So the makeup separated. It clearly says it in the title that it's water based, but I didn't realise that water and silicone don't play well."" If you're also a fan of silicone-based makeup and don't want to overhaul your entire makeup collection, LookFantastic offers the perfect solution: the NYX Professional Makeup Studio Perfect Primer - Clear. Priced at £10.99, this primer helps reduce unwanted shine and control excess oils while smoothing the skin for a flawless make up finish. More along the lines of the Maybelline Grippy Serum is the e.l.f. Power Grip Primer - a must try if you believe all the TikTok hype. Like the Grippy Serum, the formula goes tacky within 30 seconds, ensuring your makeup lasts all day long. Infused with hyaluronic acid, it moisturises, preps and smooths for a plump, flawless complexion. The best part?

As women's sports viewership continues to rise, iHeartMedia has remained dedicated to ensuring fair representation in media, with 50 percent of all newly produced sports podcasts focusing on women's sports coverage. In the past year, 80 percent of iHeartMedia listeners ages 18-54 have said that women's sports are becoming more accessible. iHeart Women's Sports downloads are also in the top 10 percent of all iHeartPodcast downloads, further emphasizing the demand for this type of dedicated content. “I think we can safely say that women's sports is not just having a moment but rather is on a now-undeniable trajectory that has been building for years. One year ago we launched iHeart Women's Sports knowing that fans were eager to feel more connected to their favorite players, teams and even other fans, and we are continuing to drive that progress forward,” said Jessie Katz, Head of iHeart Women's Sports. “We're excited to celebrate this incredible milestone and introduce even more shows to our roster this year.” In tandem with the one-year milestone, iHeart Women's Sports and Unanimous Media have teamed up with Azzi Fudd, one of the most electrifying talents in women's college basketball, to launch the network's newest podcast hosted by Azzi herself, “Fudd Around And Find Out.” Off the court, Fudd is a rising voice at the intersection of sports, media, business and culture. Fudd, who is currently finishing up her time at the University of Connecticut by earning her MBA, will aim to inspire listeners and provide a platform for underrepresented voices in sports. More details on “Fudd Around And Find Out” will be announced soon. Listen to the official trailer now HERE. ""I'm beyond excited to deepen my relationship with Stephen Curry and Unanimous Media as we launch 'Fudd Around And Find Out' with iHeart Women's Sports,” said Azzi Fudd. “This podcast is a space where I can bring my full self—athlete, storyteller, budding entrepreneur and fan of the game—and highlight the voices that deserve to be heard. Whether we're talking hoops, culture, business or life beyond the court, I want every episode to feel real and empowering. This has been a dream in the making and I truly can't wait for the world to… 'Fudd Around And Find Out.'” ""Azzi is a game-changer—on and off the court. We've watched her grow into not just a champion, but a powerful voice for the next generation,"" said Erick Peyton and Stephen Curry of Unanimous Media. ""With 'Fudd Around And Find Out,' we're proud to partner with iHeart Women's Sports and Azzi as she brings her charisma, authenticity, and fearless spirit to the mic. We're excited to help Azzi, one of the most exciting athletes in the game, share stories that matter and continue building spaces where women's sports and athletes get the spotlight they deserve."" In celebration of its success, iHeart Women's Sports, together with Ensemble, will host “Jam Sessions” on Friday, July 18, 2025 during the women's basketball all-star weekend in Indianapolis, Ind.

The event will also feature a can't-miss iHeartRadio exclusive performance by musical guest Flau'jae. ""'Jam Sessions' represent the infotainment model needed to keep women's sports top of mind and influence investment decisioning in-market—it's also a reflection of what iHeart Women's Sports delivers: a combination of engaging and timely first-person perspectives from the players and practitioners who have and continue to drive progress across the ecosystem,” said Correnti.

mov_B5C4CA08A64A76DA30900E04180D60A1,"  “These young kids are fast, but they haven't made all the mistakes, and they're not scared yet.” This savage comment from Katherine Legge underlined her attitude towards her NASCAR Cup Series debut season. The British motorsports athlete has a rich experience, having participated in endurance classics like the Rolex 24 at Daytona and the 12 Hours of Sebring. That is why Legge endured the 'baptism of fire' in the Cup Series with a solid approach. A possible threat looming in her path was none other than Carson Hocevar. The 22-year-old sophomore driver has already ruffled the feathers of several Cup Series veterans this year. Katherine Legge may have been another one, but the 40-year-old racer handled it like an icon. Katherine Legge shrugged at the rabble-rouser Well, given Carson Hocevar's record, this can be a difficult thing to do. Encountering the No. 77 Chevrolet up close has led to crashes for Ryan Blaney, Ross Chastain, and Ricky Stenhouse Jr this season. All of them swore to get back at the Spire Motorsports driver who was particularly nonchalant about his actions. In last Sunday's Sonoma Raceway event, Hocevar crossed paths with Katherine Legge. The latter encountered a brake issue during qualifying, so she had to start last. During the race, her No. 78 Live Fast Motorsports crew had to warn her about Hocevar flying past her. “Watch the 77 here”, her crew chief said. Instead of dreading another rabble-rousing tactic, Legge had a smart response. In a recent episode of 'Rubbin is Racing', Large, Quigs, and Moonhead were discussing Katherine Legge's Sonoma race. Quigs at first highlighted the fact that stunned the NASCAR community recently. In four Cup races – Phoenix, Mexico City, Chicago, and Sonoma, Legge finished better than Carson Hocevar. Quigs said, “Katherine Legge has finished ahead of Carson Hocevar in all four Cup races she has qualified for.” Then he brought the spotlight to Legge's savage radio response to seeing Hocevar in Sonoma. She said, “What is he doing? …Looking for somebody to give him a decking. I don't think he wants to be the one starting a fight. I think even I could take him.” Eventually, Katherine Legge wound up finishing 31st, one spot ahead of Carson Hocevar. Although her best finish so far has only been 19th at the Chicago Street Race (the first top 20 finish by a female racer since Danica Patrick in 2018), Quigs lauded Legge for her lighthearted banter. “She said this just totally joking around with her spotter, but I kind of like it. You know, at some point, she doored Chase Elliott because he was, I guess, you know, racing her a little bit aggressively. I really don't care if Katherine Legge races again in the NASCAR Cup Series, but while she's here, at least she's having maybe a little bit of fun with it. So, congrats to her.” Clearly, Katherine Legge is attaining the respect of the NASCAR community, one step at a time. Presently, she is ready to take on a new challenge. Adding a new venue to her timeline When Katherine Legge first formulated her NASCAR schedule, people had many doubts. She was the first woman to run a NASCAR race since Danica Patrick. She was even apprehensive about the e.l.f. brand adorning her car with a pink shade: “Oh god, that's so cliché. Do we have to do a pink car?” Following her Phoenix start, Legge faced a backlash from fans for causing twin wrecks and ruining a rival's day. Legge was not spared from vulgarity and death threats for her start. Despite this, Legge doubled down on her effort and persisted. In the Chicago Street Race, she beat Corey Heim at qualifying and clinched a remarkable 19th-place finish. So now, she is ready for the next challenge. On Tuesday this week, the racer announced her plans to compete in the 2025 Brickyard 400. Katherine Legge already has experience at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, having run in the 2023 and 2024 Indy 500s. Now, she is excited to take it a notch further. “It's always an honor to drive at Indy, but having the chance to compete in both the Cup and Xfinity races thanks to Desnuda and Droplight is going to be epic. After racing in the Indy 500 in '23 and '24, I definitely felt a void not being there this year.” She added, “But adding races to my schedule is exactly what I've been working toward. Competing in as many events as possible and logging as many laps as I can.”...","“These young kids are fast, but they haven't made all the mistakes, and they're not scared yet.” This savage comment from Katherine Legge underlined her attitude towards her NASCAR Cup Series debut season.

mov_5C739BDA1778492665BB1429EBAA0B69,"  Some of the best growth stocks are in the consumer space, and with tariffs still very much front and center, many of these stocks remain well off their highs. Nibbling on these names, say with an initial $1,000 investment, can be a good place to start. Let's look at five consumer-focused stocks to buy now while they're still on sale. These are all solid companies with a lot of potential growth still in front of them. Image source: . 1. Amazon While Amazon (AMZN 0.39%) has rallied from its lows, the stock is still off its highs and attractively valued from a historical perspective. And if there were thoughts that tariffs were slowing consumer spending, the company just announced its largest ever Prime Day sales event. Expanded to four days, the company generated $24.1 billion in sales, according to Adobe Analytics. That's more than double the sales it saw last Black Friday. While Amazon showed it still has what it takes to drive retail sales, what's most exciting about the company is what is going on behind the scenes. Years of investment in logistics, automation, robots, and artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off, and making operations even more efficient. This is leading to cost savings and strong operating leverage. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market-share leader in cloud computing, where customers are using its services to build and deploy their own AI models and tools. It's also developed its own custom chips for training and inference, which gives it both performance and cost advantages. For long-term investors, Amazon is a great stock to own. 2. Alibaba Alibaba (BABA 1.29%) is a stock that remains on sale. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 11 times and has more than 30% of its market cap in cash and investments. The stock is not just cheap, but it's executing on multiple fronts. Its cloud business has now seen AI-related revenue more than double for seven consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, Apple's decision to use Alibaba's Qwen model to power Apple Intelligence in China could be a solid growth driver. The company's e-commerce business has also seen a solid turnaround. Alibaba invested to grow Taobao and Tmall's gross merchandise value, and now it's better monetizing its platforms through new software fees and AI tools. It's also just started with new initiatives to help further drive growth, including offering one-hour delivery and embedding shoppable Taobao links in posts on the popular Chinese Rednote app. In addition, the company continues to grow and scale out its international e-commerce segment, and it expects it to turn profitable soon. Alibaba is still in the midst of its turnaround story, and at its current valuation there's a lot of upside if it continues to execute. 3. E.l.f. Beauty A sudden slowdown in growth last quarter has put e.l.f. Beauty's (ELF 2.20%) stock on the sales rack. However, its pending acquisition of Rhode looks like it could be transformative. E.l.f. has already been one of the biggest winners in the mass-market cosmetics space, and now it's adding a fast-growing premium brand to its portfolio. Rhode generated $212 million in sales over the past year with barely any paid marketing, a limited product lineup, and selling only through its website. That's impressive. Rhode was already set to enter Sephora stores, and now e.l.f. will have the opportunity to plug Rhode into its existing retail relationships, including those with Ulta Beauty and Target, while ramping up product development and marketing. Hailey Bieber remains onboard as chief creative officer, which should help maintain brand momentum as the product line expands. The strategy is smart. Premium skincare brands such as Rhode are simply going to have better margins than mass-market color cosmetics. This is a big opportunity for the company going forward and a reason to own the stock long term. 4. JAKKS Pacific Toy company JAKKS Pacific (JAKK 1.13%) has quietly become one of the best turnaround stories in consumer products. Under CFO John Kimble — formerly of Mattel and Disney — the company has streamlined operations, improved operating margins, and returned to consistent profitability. Shares are up more than 200% over the past five years, but down 30% this year on tariff worries. The result is that the stock trades at just 8.5 times 2025 analyst earnings per share estimates and 6 times the 2026 consensus. And it's not like the company is struggling. Sales jumped 26% in Q1, fueled by licensed products tied to Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Disney's Moana 2. That momentum should continue with toy and costume launches tied to Dog Man, Minecraft, and Paw Patrol....","Some of the best growth stocks are in the consumer space, and with tariffs still very much front and center, many of these stocks remain well off their highs.

And if there were thoughts that tariffs were slowing consumer spending, the company just announced its largest ever Prime Day sales event. Expanded to four days, the company generated $24.1 billion in sales, according to Adobe Analytics. That's more than double the sales it saw last Black Friday. While Amazon showed it still has what it takes to drive retail sales, what's most exciting about the company is what is going on behind the scenes. Years of investment in logistics, automation, robots, and artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off, and making operations even more efficient. This is leading to cost savings and strong operating leverage. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market-share leader in cloud computing, where customers are using its services to build and deploy their own AI models and tools. It's also developed its own custom chips for training and inference, which gives it both performance and cost advantages. For long-term investors, Amazon is a great stock to own. 2. Alibaba Alibaba (BABA 1.29%) is a stock that remains on sale. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 11 times and has more than 30% of its market cap in cash and investments. The stock is not just cheap, but it's executing on multiple fronts. Its cloud business has now seen AI-related revenue more than double for seven consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, Apple's decision to use Alibaba's Qwen model to power Apple Intelligence in China could be a solid growth driver. The company's e-commerce business has also seen a solid turnaround. Alibaba invested to grow Taobao and Tmall's gross merchandise value, and now it's better monetizing its platforms through new software fees and AI tools. It's also just started with new initiatives to help further drive growth, including offering one-hour delivery and embedding shoppable Taobao links in posts on the popular Chinese Rednote app. In addition, the company continues to grow and scale out its international e-commerce segment, and it expects it to turn profitable soon. Alibaba is still in the midst of its turnaround story, and at its current valuation there's a lot of upside if it continues to execute. 3. E.l.f. Beauty A sudden slowdown in growth last quarter has put e.l.f. Beauty's (ELF 2.20%) stock on the sales rack. However, its pending acquisition of Rhode looks like it could be transformative. E.l.f. has already been one of the biggest winners in the mass-market cosmetics space, and now it's adding a fast-growing premium brand to its portfolio. Rhode generated $212 million in sales over the past year with barely any paid marketing, a limited product lineup, and selling only through its website. That's impressive. Rhode was already set to enter Sephora stores, and now e.l.f. will have the opportunity to plug Rhode into its existing retail relationships, including those with Ulta Beauty and Target, while ramping up product development and marketing. Hailey Bieber remains onboard as chief creative officer, which should help maintain brand momentum as the product line expands. The strategy is smart. Premium skincare brands such as Rhode are simply going to have better margins than mass-market color cosmetics. This is a big opportunity for the company going forward and a reason to own the stock long term. 4. JAKKS Pacific Toy company JAKKS Pacific (JAKK 1.13%) has quietly become one of the best turnaround stories in consumer products. Under CFO John Kimble — formerly of Mattel and Disney — the company has streamlined operations, improved operating margins, and returned to consistent profitability. Shares are up more than 200% over the past five years, but down 30% this year on tariff worries. The result is that the stock trades at just 8.5 times 2025 analyst earnings per share estimates and 6 times the 2026 consensus. And it's not like the company is struggling. Sales jumped 26% in Q1, fueled by licensed products tied to Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Disney's Moana 2. That momentum should continue with toy and costume launches tied to Dog Man, Minecraft, and Paw Patrol....",2025-07-18 09:41:33,en,WEB,,,,,False,1,Positive,Anticipation,"The comment discusses E.L.F.

mov_CDE1D311FBE394FAA4275BEB2FC22372,"  7 Beauty Products I Can't Survive Summer Without (Seriously, Take My Wallet) I really appreciate you checking out my blog! Just so you know, some of the links in this post are affiliate links. This means that if you buy something through them, I might earn a little bit of money, at no extra cost to you. There's absolutely no pressure to buy anything, but if you do, it genuinely helps support the time and love I put into writing these posts. Summer and I have a complicated relationship. I love the sunshine, the pool days, the iced coffees, and pretending I live in a Pinterest picnic. But I hate how my skin goes into oil factory mode, my makeup melts off faster than my motivation, and my hair turns into a fuzzball that could rival a lion's mane. Over the years, I've tried dozens of beauty products promising to “beat the heat,” but most of them let me down—like that one friend who always cancels last minute. So after way too much trial and error, I've found my ride-or-dies: 7 beauty products I literally cannot live without during the summer months. They're affordable, all on Amazon (because yes, I'm a Prime-addicted human), and they actually do what they claim. Let's get into it. 1. e.l.f. Power Grip Primer Buy on Amazon → Let me start by saying: this stuff is glue. In the best way possible. I used to skip primer because I thought it was a scam. But once summer hits and my foundation starts sliding off like it's auditioning for Cirque du Soleil, I need something to holdit together. This primer grips my makeup like it's its job (because it is) and gives me that smooth, hydrated finish without being greasy. Bonus: It feels just like a dupe for that expensive Milk Makeup one… but it's like $10. Win-win. 2. Neutrogena Hydro Boost Water Gel with Hyaluronic Acid Buy on Amazon → My skin gets confused in the summer. It's dry in patches, oily in others, and occasionally acts like it's mad at me for drinking iced coffee instead of water. This gel moisturizer saved me. It's light, cooling, and soaks in like a dream without leaving a film. I use it morning and night—and sometimes right after I come in from the heat, just to feel something soothing. It feels like giving my skin a tall glass of water. No breakouts, no sticky residue, just happy, bouncy skin. 3. NYX Bare With Me Concealer Serum Buy on Amazon → Foundation in the summer? No thank you. I'm not trying to bake a cake on my face. Instead, I've been living for this lightweight concealer serum. It's buildable, blends like a dream, and looks like skin—not like a mask. I use it under my eyes, around my nose, and on any little blemish trying to ruin my day. It doesn't crease, doesn't melt, and somehow makes me look like I actually slept last night. Which, spoiler: I didn't. 4. Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant Buy on Amazon → Let's talk clogged pores. Summer means sweat, sunscreen, and leftover makeup—and all that stuff loves to hang out in my pores like uninvited guests. I started using this exfoliant a few nights a week and noticed a huge difference. My skin looks smoother, my breakouts are way less intense, and those weird little bumps on my forehead? Gone. It's a holy grail product for a reason. Just make sure you wear sunscreen during the day (but you're already doing that, right? RIGHT?) . 5. Pacifica Underarm Deodorant Wipes Buy on Amazon → Okay, hear me out: I never thought I needed deodorant wipes… until I did. One day I was running late to a brunch, totally forgot deodorant, and grabbed one of these from my glove box out of desperation.

You could also look up more videos on YouTube, as there are a ton of tutorials there as well! The main thing is learning polish control, making sure that there isn't too much polish on the brush but there's still enough that you can coat the entire nail without having to dip back into the bottle. This will come with practice & will change depending on the length of your nails. What I like to do is kinda wiggle the wand (what the brush is attached to) against the inside of the neck of the bottle to make sure there isn't a bunch of polish that's gonna drip down & then swipe most of the polish off one side of the brush. [Here's a little video to better explain!] (https://www.reddit.com/user/juleznailedithelps/comments/ka06vu/polish_control/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) When painting your nails, you're bound to end up with polish somewhere you don't want it to be. You can use a toothpick, a cuticle pusher, or anything small and pointed to kinda scrape the flooded polish out of your cuticles. After removing that excess polish, you can take a small brush (angled eyeliner brushes or small concealer brushes work great for this!) dipped in acetone to gently clean up any remaining polish on your cuticles. The $1 E.L.F. concealer/eyeliner brushes are a super popular option for clean up brushes! I also like to use a [dappen dish](https://www.sallybeauty.com/nails/acrylic-nails/glass-dappen-dish/SBS-154855.html) (you can also buy them on Amazon!) to pour my acetone into so I'm not having to dip into the big container of acetone (a few people have accidentally dropped their brushes in the bottle lol).","In terms of learning to paint your nails better, it all comes down to practice!

Beauty deal in May Michelle Lee Link copied Jerritt Clark/ Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber in 2023 NEED TO KNOW A rep for Hailey Bieber confirms to PEOPLE that the $1 billion from Rhode's e.l.f. Beauty acquisition has nothing to do with husband Justin Bieber's financial settlement Rumors began circulating that Justin Bieber postponed the settlement until Hailey's deal was funded, but her rep says the deal is ""separate"" from the singer's ""business affairs"" Earlier this month, the singer agreed to pay his former manager Scooter Braun $31.5 million, a majority of which will go toward an advance for his Justice Tour that Braun's company had covered Hailey Bieber is standing on business, despite what rumors may say about where the money from her $1 billion Rhode deal is going. Earlier this month, her husband, Justin Bieber, settled a financial dispute with his former manager Scooter Braun. The singer, 31, agreed to pay $26 million to Braun's former company HYBE as part of an advance the singer received from AEG Presents for his ultimately canceled 2022 Justice Tour, plus an additional $5.5 million to cover half of the $11 million in unpaid commissions he owed Braun. TMZ was first to report on July 10 that Bieber and Braun settled the dispute, the same day it was revealed that Bieber would be releasing his seventh album, Swag, and that he had launched his fashion brand SKYLRK. Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic Justin and Hailey Bieber at the 2022 Grammys At the same time, rumors began circulating that the Grammy winner waited to settle his debt after Hailey, 28, secured her $1 billion from e.l.f Beauty's acquisition of her brand Rhode in May. However, a rep for Hailey confirms to PEOPLE that Rhode's business move is in no way associated with her husband's settlement. “The historic sale of rhode is a huge accomplishment for Hailey and is completely separate from her husband and his business affairs."" The acquisition of Hailey's company, which she launched in 2022, occurred on May 28. She will continue her role as founder and additionally serve as Rhode's chief creative officer and head of innovation, overseeing creative, product innovation and marketing. She will also act as a strategic advisor to the combined companies.

She's proud of how far Rhode has come, and she truly believes that teaming up with e.l.f will help take the brand to the next level. The resources and support they're bringing to the table are everything she's been hoping for."" ""To be acquired and recognized by such a powerful global company feels like such an honor to her. She can't wait to take Rhode global. She also received a generous cash payout as part of the deal."" During an appearance at the Business of Beauty Global Forum on June 10, the mom of one said she had a good feeling about the business proposition. “I remember walking away like, 'They're it,'” she recalled. “I knew it in my gut. We just said so many of the same things."" She also called Rhode ""her baby,"" so the idea of even partnering up was a ""very, very big deal.""

TMZ was first to report on July 10 that Bieber and Braun settled the dispute, the same day it was revealed that Bieber would be releasing his seventh album, Swag, and that he had launched his fashion brand SKYLRK. Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic Justin and Hailey Bieber at the 2022 Grammys At the same time, rumors began circulating that the Grammy winner waited to settle his debt after Hailey, 28, secured her $1 billion from e.l.f Beauty's acquisition of her brand Rhode in May. However, a rep for Hailey confirms to PEOPLE that Rhode's business move is in no way associated with her husband's settlement. “The historic sale of rhode is a huge accomplishment for Hailey and is completely separate from her husband and his business affairs."" The acquisition of Hailey's company, which she launched in 2022, occurred on May 28. She will continue her role as founder and additionally serve as Rhode's chief creative officer and head of innovation, overseeing creative, product innovation and marketing. She will also act as a strategic advisor to the combined companies.

Download it now for the most binge-worthy celeb content, exclusive video clips, astrology updates and more! Following the news, a source told PEOPLE that Hailey didn't even have to look for a buyer. ""This deal came to her,"" the source shared. ""She's incredibly excited about this new step. She's proud of how far Rhode has come, and she truly believes that teaming up with e.l.f will help take the brand to the next level. The resources and support they're bringing to the table are everything she's been hoping for."" ""To be acquired and recognized by such a powerful global company feels like such an honor to her. She can't wait to take Rhode global. She also received a generous cash payout as part of the deal."" During an appearance at the Business of Beauty Global Forum on June 10, the mom of one said she had a good feeling about the business proposition. “I remember walking away like, 'They're it,'” she recalled. “I knew it in my gut. We just said so many of the same things."" She also called Rhode ""her baby,"" so the idea of even partnering up was a ""very, very big deal."" As his wife celebrated the major milestone, a source told PEOPLE that Justin is ""beyond proud"" because she'd ""seen how hard she's worked from day one.""

L'Oréal Paris BB Cream, a green-tinted formula that combats redness through the power of color theory. It doesn't stop there — it also works to even complexion, hydrate with vitamin E, and set the perfect stage for you to apply your makeup on. Turns out you don't have to drop $50+ on Dr Jart+'s Cicapair Color Correcting Cream! This starts green and blends into a ""universal shade,"" which may not be a perfect match for fair or dark skin. Promising review: ""I swear by this. Been using it for about a year now, it goes on every day and gets all the redness off my face, when I'm in a hurry I just top it off with a little powder and I'm done but it's a perfect base layer for any makeup routine if you had a lot of redness like I do."" –Andrea Get it from Amazon for $9.98+ (available in two sizes and also other styles). 2. And an ultra-affordable E.l.f. color corrector that comes in a ton of shades to help counteract different types of discoloration, like redness and dark spots. Mix and match to create the perfect foundation for the rest of your makeup routine. Promising review: ""Best value for the money. Easy to apply and enough coverage — not cakey, which I liked the most. And it lasts a long time without creasing."" —Vish Get it from Amazon for $4 (available in five shades). 3. A nail and cuticle oil to bring life back to your damaged nails, even if you did something really bad like — gasp! — peel off a gel manicure. This formula will get your nails back in tip-top shape and ready for that seashell nail art you had in mind. This oil has jojoba oil, sweet almond oil, and vitamin E to help promote strong nails and soften cuticles. Promising review: ""I had peeling, weak nails for years. Tried everything. I bought this in February. This size bottle lasted a bit more than a month, religiously applying it two to three times a day. I was really seeing great improvement so I bought another bottle in late March. By May, all the peeling had grown out, and my nails were getting stronger every day. I then bought the big four-ounce refill bottle because I never want to run out of it again! Cannot recommend this stuff enough!"" —Diana Get it from Amazon for $9.90+ (available in three sizes). 4. Ogx Argan Oil of Morocco Curl-Defining Cream for curls so bouncy you'll be jumping for joy (and to show them off). The argan oil-boosted formula moisturizes and tames frizz (nice try, summer humidity!) while adding a level of volume and shine you'd normally expect from a much higher price point. BuzzFeed Shopping contributor Jasmin Sandal says, ""My hair is the ~perfect~ combo of wavy, curly, and frizzy and this drugstore product has been a holy grail of mine for some time. I've found that it's the only formula that will give me soft, naturally curly waves come the a.m. and since I'm generally a nighttime hair washer, I have the perfect excuse to avoid blasting my hair with heat. Before hitting the pillow, I like to run my fingers through my towel-dried hair with a pea-sized amount of this, flip my mane over, and then give the ends a good scrunch. In the morn, my hair appears shiny with defined, wavy curls — we're not talking HD — but they have a nice, soft definition to them that doesn't require much styling."" Promising review: ""Absolutely love this stuff! It's the one hair product I have to have.

mov_BE18076EF2AB75B4B8FD40C99C06CF84,"  by 19/07/2025 APEX / MEGA Justin Bieber, fresh off the release of his new album “Swag” and a series of carefully curated family photos, appears to be projecting an image of renewed confidence. However, beneath the surface, sources close to the pop star reveal a more complex reality: a struggle with persistent personal challenges, fluctuating moods, and growing tensions within his marriage to Hailey Bieber. The new album itself offers a glimpse into this internal conflict, featuring introspective interludes that feel strikingly candid, almost like therapy sessions laid bare. This vulnerability comes as Hailey Bieber's Rhode beauty brand experiences unprecedented success, recently securing a landmark $1 billion deal, adding another layer to the dynamic within the couple. Justin Bieber's Comeback: A Mask for Underlying Struggles? MEGA Released on July 11th, “Swag” was accompanied by a series of polished family portraits featuring Bieber, Hailey, and their 11-month-old son, Jack Blues. While the images portray a picture of domestic bliss, insiders suggest this carefully constructed facade may be concealing deeper turmoil. Reports indicate a pattern of increasingly frequent disagreements with paparazzi, subtle displays of friction between Justin and Hailey on social media, and erratic behavior in the months leading up to the album's launch. “He doesn't particularly handle [fame] well,” a source confided to Page Six. “Imagine being thrust into the spotlight at 14, constantly subjected to both adoration and intense scrutiny. It's a pressure cooker that breaks many people. I'm genuinely concerned for him.” Another celebrity insider echoed these concerns, stating Bieber “still has underlying issues” that continue to surface. Did You Know? : Justin Bieber first gained widespread recognition at the age of 15 after being discovered on YouTube by talent manager Scooter Braun. The Singer Gets Real About Fame, Family, and Finding His Way Raw Image LTD/MEGA Four years after the release of “Justice” and two years following the abrupt cancellation of his world tour due to health concerns, Bieber's latest project marks a shift in tone. Now a father, the 31-year-old artist presents a more subdued and introspective persona. The album notably features three interludes with comedian Druski, one of which, titled “Therapy Sessions,” provides a direct window into Bieber's struggles with public perception. “What's been a tough thing for me recently is feeling like I have had to go through a lot of my struggles as a human, as all of us do, really publicly,” Bieber shared during the interlude, with Druski acting as his counselor. “And so people are always asking if I'm OK, and that starts to really weigh on me. It starts to make me feel like I'm the one with the issues and everyone else is perfect.” Justin Bieber's Public Struggles, Marriage Woes, and a Family Under Scrutiny zz/XNY/starmaxinc. com/Newscom/MEGA A source familiar with Bieber's situation told Page Six that his recent social media posts have reflected a sense of frustration and inner turmoil. “If you have a friend and they're posting [like that] – I can tell he's angry just by looking at his posts,” the source explained. “He has mood swings – he's kind of an extreme personality in that sense.” The lyrics of “Walking Away” hint at potential strains in his marriage to Hailey, with lines like: “Days go by so fast, don't wanna spend them with you / So tell me why you're throwing stones at my back / You know I'm defenseless. Girl, we better stop before we say some sh–t / We've been testing our patience / I think we better off if we just take a break.” The couple has made concerted efforts to protect their son, Jack Blues, from the relentless glare of the paparazzi. However, some have questioned Bieber's decision to feature the 11-month-old on the album cover, even with his face obscured. “He obviously wants to protect his kid. But it's like 'Oh, we want privacy,' then they put the kid on album covers and books,” a celebrity insider observed. What do you think about the pressures of fame on young artists like Justin Bieber? And how can celebrities navigate the challenges of maintaining a private life while living in the public eye? With Hailey Bieber's Empire Rising, What's Next for Her Husband? MEGA Financially, the Bieber family appears secure, largely due to Hailey's thriving Rhode beauty brand. The company recently finalized a $1 billion deal with e.l.f. Cosmetics, including $800 million in cash and an additional $200 million contingent on future growth. This success has led to speculation about Justin Bieber's next move. The question of whether Bieber will embark on a tour to support “Swag” remains unanswered. Insiders suggest this decision is particularly significant given Hailey's company's rapid expansion. Those close to the singer believe a return to the stage could be beneficial for both his professional and personal well-being. “He needs to perform,” a celebrity insider stated....","by 19/07/2025 APEX / MEGA Justin Bieber, fresh off the release of his new album “Swag” and a series of carefully curated family photos, appears to be projecting an image of renewed confidence.

mov_E6ACFFAB5817EE6688C8A7DF23D9BCB0,"  If you haven't tried this $6 cult-fave dry shampoo yet, your roots are in for a treat. 1. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder to absorb oil and blur pores so effectively that you'll be like, ""Oh...witchcraft??"" Might be the only explanation for how this can matte-ify your complexion while still keeping it radiant and glowy like the fresh summer dew. ✨ Promising review: ""I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe."" —Charlotte Laim Price: $25 2. A pair of Bottega Veneta–inspired pilot shield sunglasses so close to the $699 version that reviewers are *spooked* by the attention to detail, down to the weight of them. These are already blowing up on TikTok so I'd personally grab them NOW before everyone descends on them. Promising review: ""TikTok made me buy these!! One video did it for me and I RAN to Amazon. And yes, I bought ALLL the colors. They fit like a dream and are good quality. People that know their sunglasses thought these were the REAL THING! For the price, these are made EXTREMELY well and look hecka expensive. Get all the colors so you can wear them for every season."" —Santana Davis Price: $14.99 (available in 10 tints) 3. E.l.f. Glow Reviver Melting Lip Balm for all the ultra fans of Summer Fridays, Rhode, and Laneige whose bank accounts are begging them to put a stop to the lippie madness. These new deliciously tinted, moisturizing, buildable glosses are just as buttery and decadent as the balms that inspired them, for a fraction of the price. (Brb, drowning myself in the ""Strawberry Shortcake"" and ""Vanilla Toffee"" flavors.) Promising review: ""Diva, stop letting these influencers sway you into spending your hard-earned (and scarce) beans on $20–$30 subpar lip balms — you're paying for the brand, and the quality is questionable. ELF KNOCKED THEM BOTH OUTTA THE PARK WITH THIS! SO BUTTERY, SO YUMMY, SOOOOOOO MUCH PRODUCT!!!!! i wasn't expecting the tube to be so generous in size, by far the biggest amount I've seen from the market. The flavors are divine, the color payoff is even better than Summer Fridays … and it's only $9, you cannot go wrong. I just can't fathom any balm being priced above $12, E.l.f. always hits and barely misses. "" —SONIA Price: $9 (available in Strawberry Shortcake, Blackberry Sorbet, Java Chip, Vanilla Toffee, Wild Cherry, and Yummy Gummy). 4. Dae's Hair Cactus Fruit 3-In-1 Styling Cream & Taming Wand, which is basically the brand's ""holy grail,"" TikTok-famous styling cream in the form of a mascara wand. This versatile lil' tool helps you carefully target flyaways, style edges, and smooth frizz. Dae is a small business that specializes in haircare and styling products. Check out a TikTok of the taming wand in action. (It goes without saying that you don't need to lay your edges if you don't want to, but this is a handy option if you do.) Promising review: ""I've tried numerous products for taming baby hairs, especially post-partum, and this is hands down the best thing I've tried. It also smells incredible!
