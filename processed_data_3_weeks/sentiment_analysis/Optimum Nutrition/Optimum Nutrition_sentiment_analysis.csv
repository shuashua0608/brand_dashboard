1ls2cmj,"  Citing- Last month around 4,000 people bought muscle blaze double rich chocolate whey protein on amazon. While around 6,000 people bought the whole truth unflavoured whey protein. Its a good thing some brands are giving 500rs samples nowadays on blinkit due to competition so we can try before purchasing in bulk.

I think govt should subsidise them, won't increased productivity help govt in the end? 2- Why does the whole truth whey protein is being more bought then muscle blaze whey, even though whole truth is unflavoured, similarly priced and quite new entry (therefore suspicious) in market? 3- Many leading brands sell digestive enzymes along with whey protein, why do we Indians lack protein digesting enzymes? Is it our natural defense mechanism to avoid fatal issues caused by too much protein? 4- The taste of unflavoured muscle blaze whey protein concentrate is sour and bitter, also the taste of optimum nutrition double rich chocolate whey protein is very less chocolate/sweet type compared to mb double rich one, I have to try very hard to stop feeling of gag reflex/gastric uneasiness upon drinking of bad taste whey protein with water (i dont like adding it to milk, banana,etc, i like my protein raw in water), how are people really coping with them, though they really dont care for awful taste? then why do people still buying these two boxes of whey? 6- why beginner's whey protein boxes are not popular for people beginning gym?

0A1714757D78F0BAA5AC0542E0DEC852,"  THE GUCCI MODEL SHOOTS for Vogue, GQ and Elle Magazine. Modelling for Calvin Klein. Gucci snapping her up as a brand ambassador. Clearly, as well as being an impressive England captain, Leah Williamson, 28, has a catwalk-worthy fashion career too. One of the biggest earners off the pitch after leading the Lionesses to victory at the Euro 2022 final, the blonde beauty has a deal with Nike and has collaborated with global brands such as Aston Martin, Pepsi, Walkers and Mastercard. With 1.1 million Instagram followers, she has new advert partnerships with Weetabix and Cadbury, along with six children's books, titled The Wonder Team. With the deals comes the gloss: her recent lavish Mallorcan holiday to an Ikos resort would have set her back in the region of £1,000 a night. She is rumoured to be dating former model and Miss USA Elle Smith - both have posted about each other on social media. LAUREN'S OOH LA LA LEGO PROVING that every passion can be profitable, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, 24, has topped up her estimated £400,000 salary with a sponsorship deal with Lego. Devoted to creating Lego masterpieces in her downtime, saying it's 'the best way to relax', she's even made the Mona Lisa out of the bricks. Her other sponsors include Nike and Sports Direct. Lauren also has the support of her girlfriend, former Liverpool midfielder Ashley Hodson. Together for two years, the pair recently enjoyed a romantic trip to Paris, where Lauren saw the Mona Lisa in her more traditional setting. SHY SUPERSTAR WITH AN EX ON THE TEAM GROWING up, Lucy Bronze lived on Lindisfarne - also known as Holy Island - off the windswept coast of Northumberland. Her grandmother was caretaker of Lindisfarne Castle and today the outline of that building is tattooed on Lucy's wrist. Shy into adulthood, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism in 2021. But neither her isolated upbringing nor her neurodiversity held her back. Rather, she's said she uses the intense focus associated with her conditions to her advantage - and now the 33-year-old is one of the biggest earners in the game. She reportedly took home £200,000 a year while playing at Barcelona before her move to Chelsea in 2024. Big money deals followed her triumph at the last Euros, with Pepsi, EE, Klarna and Visa among her backers. Her former girlfriend is fellow Lioness Keira Walsh. FASHION WEEK REGULAR SHE earned almost £2million in 2023 alone, according to Forbes magazine. That same year, Alessia Russo's transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal made her one of the most expensive female footballers on the planet. Her contract is said to be worth more than £500,000 a year and her commercial appeal is just as lucrative. She has deals with Gucci, Adidas, PlayStation, Beats by Dr Dre and last month was gifted an MGS5 EV car, which she proudly showed off on Instagram. A regular at London Fashion Week, Alessia, 26, has appeared on the cover of magazines such as Women's Health. The BAFTA TV Awards in May saw her in a £1,295 Roland Mouret dress, right. BURBERRY CLAD GOALIE BURBERRY HANNAH Hampton - the longhaired goalkeeper with the girl-next-door looks - certainly has big shoes to fill after Mary Earps surprisingly announced her retirement from the squad last month. The 24-year-old Chelsea player has posed in Burberry for Elle magazine and counts Nike and Extra chewing gum among her corporate sponsors. She also works with Birmingham Children's Hospital after enduring numerous eye operations as a child to cure a squint. Hannah was told she would never be a professional sports player. ' I've gone through life proving people wrong,' she said recently, words that inspired devotion among her 228,000 Instagram followers. Her relationship status isn't known. DUBAI DEVOTEE SHE never travels without her Louis Vuitton luggage, can often be seen posing in a Maybach car, and enjoys swanky trips to Dubai, staying at the luxury Five resort there. Chelsea star Lauren James, 23, has treated herself to some of the finer things in life since her key role in the Lionesses' 2023 World Cup campaign. While her relationship status isn't known, she's close to her older brother Reece, who plays for the Chelsea men's team. She has commercial deals with Nike, Google Pixel, Optimum Nutrition, Sure deodorant and Walkers. The superstar siblings often attend red carpet events together. But while she is reportedly on £350,000 a year at Chelsea, Reece earns £250,000 a week. KOOKY STYLE SO DEVOTED is she to tattoos that midfielder Georgia Stanway, 26, not only has around 100 of her own inkings, but she's also learned to tattoo other people. The Bayern Munich star's kooky style has won her sponsors including Nike and an advertising deal with Celsius drinks, who featured on her Instagram page, where she has 433,000 followers. Off the pitch, she's been with Toulouse rugby league player Olly Ashall-Bott since 2022....","THE GUCCI MODEL SHOOTS for Vogue, GQ and Elle Magazine. Modelling for Calvin Klein. Gucci snapping her up as a brand ambassador. Clearly, as well as being an impressive England captain, Leah Williamson, 28, has a catwalk-worthy fashion career too. One of the biggest earners off the pitch after leading the Lionesses to victory at the Euro 2022 final, the blonde beauty has a deal with Nike and has collaborated with global brands such as Aston Martin, Pepsi, Walkers and Mastercard. With 1.1 million Instagram followers, she has new advert partnerships with Weetabix and Cadbury, along with six children's books, titled The Wonder Team. With the deals comes the gloss: her recent lavish Mallorcan holiday to an Ikos resort would have set her back in the region of £1,000 a night. She is rumoured to be dating former model and Miss USA Elle Smith - both have posted about each other on social media. LAUREN'S OOH LA LA LEGO PROVING that every passion can be profitable, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, 24, has topped up her estimated £400,000 salary with a sponsorship deal with Lego. Devoted to creating Lego masterpieces in her downtime, saying it's 'the best way to relax', she's even made the Mona Lisa out of the bricks. Her other sponsors include Nike and Sports Direct. Lauren also has the support of her girlfriend, former Liverpool midfielder Ashley Hodson. Together for two years, the pair recently enjoyed a romantic trip to Paris, where Lauren saw the Mona Lisa in her more traditional setting. SHY SUPERSTAR WITH AN EX ON THE TEAM GROWING up, Lucy Bronze lived on Lindisfarne - also known as Holy Island - off the windswept coast of Northumberland. Her grandmother was caretaker of Lindisfarne Castle and today the outline of that building is tattooed on Lucy's wrist. Shy into adulthood, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism in 2021. But neither her isolated upbringing nor her neurodiversity held her back. Rather, she's said she uses the intense focus associated with her conditions to her advantage - and now the 33-year-old is one of the biggest earners in the game. She reportedly took home £200,000 a year while playing at Barcelona before her move to Chelsea in 2024.

They're pretty bland but a good protein boost and good to add to breakfasts (I like them added to soya yogurt and protein granola) There are a good number of vegan protein shakes available but I'm personally not a massive fan. The Optimum Nutrition clear vegan protein is quite nice (I buy the peach flavour) and iirc it was higher protein than the other clear vegan proteins.","I'm vegan :) My main protein sources are things like tofu, seitan and tempeh, along with beans and lentils.

n2by3nf,"  Damn, sorry you had a rough experience bro — totally fair to be frustrated when stuff like that happens. For what it's worth, I've had the opposite experience so far. Been using Hyugalife for the past 5 months, mainly for protein powders (bought Optimum Nutrition and MuscleBlaze a few times), and I've had no major issues. Deliveries usually show up in 3–5 days in Mumbai, and once when I had a delay, I DMed them on Instagram and actually got a quick reply — way faster than emailing support. Also made the address mistake once 😅 — I called the courier directly (they used Delhivery in my case), and the guy helped reroute it to a pickup point nearby. Still annoying, but I think these issues happen on most platforms, tbh. HealthKart gave me a broken shaker once, and Amazon once sent me the wrong flavor — so no one's perfect. That said, I always go for COD now and avoid big orders unless it's during their sale periods (like July 12–14 coming up), 'cause that's when the deals are actually worth it. If you're ordering again, maybe try sticking to known brands + COD and see if it's smoother? Hope your refund comes through fast though — been there, it sucks.","Damn, sorry you had a rough experience bro — totally fair to be frustrated when stuff like that happens. For what it's worth, I've had the opposite experience so far. Been using Hyugalife for the past 5 months, mainly for protein powders (bought Optimum Nutrition and MuscleBlaze a few times), and I've had no major issues. Deliveries usually show up in 3–5 days in Mumbai, and once when I had a delay, I DMed them on Instagram and actually got a quick reply — way faster than emailing support. Also made the address mistake once — I called the courier directly (they used Delhivery in my case), and the guy helped reroute it to a pickup point nearby.

Also Optimum Nutrition has the same non-compliant teaser badging. Brian Phelan is the team being too aggressive? Is Amazon letting this slide? Is Glanbia's team asleep at the wheel? or is loading your own badging now something every brand can get away with?? Ryan Thompson Naman Jain - sure you guys are heads down and slammed with prime week, probably escaped your radar. but is this ok now?? just looking for some consistent enforcement / clarity on this one…. Anyone else seeing brands do teasers / callouts / unapproved badging and getting away with it?

I was in the same boat, “man I'm gonna go on a crazy cut, I wanna lose it all as fast as possible” (Maybe you're not thinking like that lmao who knows) But as someone who's been fat and is now fit my biggest piece of advice is to do a body recomp, which is losing weight through putting on muscle and losing fat. You can search up a calculator to figure this out since I'm not really sure the math behind it I never did this, and it was my biggest regret. First of all, get yourself some whey protein, Its like 40 bucks on amazon. I get “Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder, Double Rich Chocolate” Make sure you get a shaker bottle too with those little whisks balls in the cup The chocolate one tastes really good, but make sure you mix it with water, because mixing with milk is way too many calories. I like to have 2 scoops of protein powder in my drink, and I personally drink it 2 times a day Secondly, you're going to need to make an effort to EAT properly, get your protein in, try to eat your carbs at night, and get some health fats in. One great way to do this is by eating avocados, but don't eat too many because they are very calorie dense. 90% of getting built is made on your diet, and since you're going to be in a body recomp/cut, you're going to need to get accustomed to being hungry, and STANDING ON BUSINESS with your calories. At a minimum, find out the calories you SHOULD be eating for example 2300 calories a day, and count the calories you ACTUALLY eat, you will really be shocked once you start seeing what kind of shit you're eating, and it'll start a subconscious shift in your mind Also make sure get a gym membership, and go to the gym as frequently as possible, ideally 3-5 times a week, I like to use the push-pull-legs-push-pull-rest split, but that's just me AND MAKE SURE TO SHAVE THE BEARD. keep the goatee, but shave that fuckin Reddit beard that's coming in, I'm saying this out of love when I say that it does NOT look good, we've all been there. Other than that, you have unbelievable potential, you don't even understand. You aren't gonna unlock that potential unless you start putting in some work, but I trust in the process bro 💪 good luck man","PLEASE DO NOT LOSE TOO MUCH WEIGHT TOO QUICKLY.

mov_5025D84F9AE63522B9F3E7EE74ED15C8,"  SPR_COMBO[it]La creatina è uno degli integratori più utilizzati nel mondo del fitness e del bodybuilding. Nota per la sua efficacia nell'aumentare la forza e la massa muscolare, è anche oggetto di numerosi studi scientifici che ne confermano i benefici. Tuttavia, non tutte le forme di creatina sono uguali, e nemmeno le modalità di assunzione. In questa guida approfondita vedremo quale creatina scegliere , come usarla correttamente e quali effetti aspettarsi per ottenere il massimo sviluppo muscolare in sicurezza. Cos'è la creatina e come funziona nel corpo        La creatina è una molecola prodotta naturalmente nel corpo a partire da tre aminoacidi: arginina, glicina e metionina . Si trova principalmente nei muscoli, dove viene convertita in fosfocreatina , un composto che svolge un ruolo cruciale nella produzione di energia rapida (ATP) durante sforzi intensi e brevi, come il sollevamento pesi o gli scatti. Integrare creatina significa aumentare le riserve di fosfocreatina nei muscoli, permettendo di sostenere carichi di lavoro maggiori, stimolando più efficacemente la sintesi proteica e, nel tempo, la crescita muscolare . I benefici della creatina per l'aumento della massa muscolare     Ecco i principali vantaggi che rendono la creatina uno degli integratori più efficaci per l'ipertrofia:      Incremento della forza massimale e della potenza esplosiva    Maggiore volume di allenamento (più ripetizioni e serie)    Aumento della ritenzione intracellulare di acqua muscolare, che migliora l'anabolismo    Stimolazione indiretta della sintesi proteica grazie a sessioni più intense    Recupero muscolare più rapido tra una serie e l'altra     Quale tipo di creatina scegliere: le forme più diffuse a confronto     Non tutte le forme di creatina sono ugualmente efficaci. Vediamo le principali:         Conclusione : per la maggior parte delle persone, la creatina monoidrato (meglio se micronizzata ) resta la scelta migliore per rapporto efficacia/prezzo/sicurezza . Come assumere correttamente la creatina     Per sfruttare al meglio i benefici della creatina, è importante rispettare dosaggi e tempistiche adeguate. Esistono due approcci principali:     Fase di carico + mantenimento     Carico : 20 g al giorno divisi in 4 dosi da 5 g per 5–7 giorni    Mantenimento : 3–5 g al giorno per le settimane successive      Questo metodo accelera la saturazione muscolare ma non è obbligatorio. Potrebbero verificarsi gonfiore o disturbi intestinali nei soggetti sensibili. Assunzione costante     3–5 g al giorno, ogni giorno, senza fase di carico      Richiede circa 3 settimane per raggiungere la saturazione muscolare, ma è più tollerabile per molti. Quando assumere la creatina     Gli studi mostrano che l'assunzione post-allenamento , insieme a carboidrati e proteine, può ottimizzare l'assorbimento e favorire la sintesi muscolare. Consiglio pratico :  Prendi 3–5 g di creatina monoidrato dopo l'allenamento insieme a uno shake proteico o a una fonte di carboidrati semplici. Effetti collaterali, miti da sfatare e sicurezza    È pericolosa per i reni? Numerosi studi dimostrano che la creatina non danneggia i reni in soggetti sani. Chi ha problemi renali preesistenti dovrebbe consultare un medico. Fa ingrassare? No, ma può causare un leggero aumento del peso corporeo (1–2 kg) nelle prime settimane per effetto della ritenzione idrica intracellulare , un meccanismo favorevole alla crescita muscolare. Deve essere ciclizzata? Non è necessario interromperla ciclicamente. L'uso prolungato (fino a 5 anni) si è dimostrato sicuro e benefico se rispettati i dosaggi. Creatina e dieta: è sufficiente quella contenuta negli alimenti? Alimenti come carne rossa e pesce contengono circa 1–2 g di creatina ogni 500 g , quantità troppo bassa per raggiungere la saturazione muscolare senza integrazione. L'integratore è quindi altamente consigliato , specie per vegetariani e vegani che hanno livelli naturalmente più bassi. Con un uso costante e inserita in un contesto di allenamento strutturato e dieta iperproteica bilanciata , la creatina può diventare un alleato fondamentale per chi desidera sviluppare massa muscolare in modo efficace e sicuro .

I had raised a complaint immediately, but to my shock, it was closed with the conclusion that I received the correct item. This is incorrect and unacceptable. I have photographic proof clearly showing that I received a grocery item instead of whey protein. This is not just a customer service failure — it feels like fraud. I request that this issue be re-opened, thoroughly investigated, and resolved with either a full refund or replacement at the earliest. I feel like telling me that I got the correct order instead of investigating the matter correctly is a huge flaw of this customer service. I tried to convey this to the customer service team via phone but they simply hung up to phone on me multiple times.The last 2 complaints team reps who disconnected my call was Rahul which was around 2'o clock and then Parag who I informed and requested not to disconnected the call after telling my previous experience but he also did the same things.
