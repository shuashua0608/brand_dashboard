Dove's Coconut Milk & Sugar Lychee Body Wash so moisturizing, gentle, and decadently-scented that you're going to feel fully transported to your ~happy place~ every time you lather it on. This is especially lovely for sensitive skin, since the plant milk base is nutrient-rich and sulfate-free to keep your skin feeling eeextra soft and loved. Promising review: ""I am loving this body wash, the smell is incredible and the formula is great. Way better than the original Dove formula body washes. I find that it's more gentle and cleansing without any weird film left behind. I hope they never discontinue this line because I love it!"" —D Get it from Amazon for $9.99. 2. A two-in-one nausea relief inhaler designed to work FAST on spontaneous nausea, motion sickness, morning sickness, and general queasiness (having a human body is hard). You can either use it as a scent inhaler or rub it directly on the tip of your nose for relief. Promising review: ""Took this on my first cruise. Anytime that I started to feel woozy, I'd reach for it. I'm sure the required act of deep breathing helped a lot — and breathing in the fragrance of the essential oil is very calming and effective.

If you're looking for an easy way to cut plastic from your life, these are about to be your new lunchtime BFFs. Promising review: ""I've been using these compostable sandwich bags for about a year now and I'm really happy with them. The quality is great — they hold up well without tearing or getting flimsy — and it's such a bonus knowing they're eco-friendly. I love that I can just toss them in the compost when I'm done. It feels good to make a small change that actually makes a difference. Highly recommend!"" —MPS Get a set of 25 from Amazon for $16.99 (also available in quart and gallon sizes). 4.

Promising review: ""My new must-have! My number one go-to for healing lips was Carmex. This beat it.

My coworkers and I on the PEOPLE shopping team collectively spend hundreds of hours a week scouring the internet for celebrity-worn fashion and deals we'd be remiss not to share with the world. But what are we adding to our own carts, you ask? This Amazon Prime Day, I tapped writers, editors, and directors to reveal not just the best deals this year, but also what they're most excited to personally get their hands on — especially while they're up to 50 percent off.

Shop like a pro and add them to your cart while prices start at just $13. Amazon Prime Day PEOPLE Picks Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask, $17 with Prime Amazon “I've been using Laneige's ever-popular lip mask every day for more than five years, and I always restock my stash during Prime Day. It has an ultra-rich formula that instantly hydrates my lips and provides long-lasting nourishment. I use it each night before bed, but it works great as a lip balm throughout the day, too.” —Clara McMahon, senior Amazon news and deals writer Away Bigger Carry-On, $236 with Prime Amazon “I've had the same suitcase for more years than I care to admit, so I'm finally treating myself to this sleek Away carry-on while it's marked down.” —Lindsey Greenfeld, senior shopping editor Caraway Petite Cooker, $99 with Prime People “I don't need to cook a large amount of food at one time, and this tiny Caraway pot has been a game changer in my kitchen. I can quickly boil eggs or make rice because I don't have to sit and wait for a massive pot of water to come to a boil. Plus, it's really cute, so I can leave it sitting out on the stove and admire it even when I'm not cooking.” —Erin Johnson, editorial director of content marketing Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler Nordstrom “The Dyson AirWrap is the Aston Martin of all hair tools, and it certainly has a price to show for it. But since I've been thinking about it for over two years now, it's long out of the 'impulse purchase' category and is something I genuinely think I'd use over and over again, probably every day, even — that's how often I wash my hair!” —Alyssa Grabinski, senior shopping writer Elescat Boho Vintage Sundress, $14 with Prime Amazon “I absolutely roast on the New York subway, so this summer, I'm on the hunt for breezy, lightweight dresses that I can throw on for the office, brunch, and everything in between. I think this simple dress is so cute with over 30 patterns and colors to choose from. Its A-line silhouette looks good on everyone, and the breathable cotton will be ideal as temperatures continue to rise.” —Madison Yauger, shopping editor Camkory Digital Camera, $40 with Prime Amazon “I bought this digital camera during Black Friday, as I wanted to try one out that was similar to the cameras I had when I was a teenager. It's been a fun little addition to my camera collection, especially when traveling and at parties and weddings I've brought it to. My 10-year-old nephew has become a fan of it, and it's super easy to use. Now he'll have his own camera to practice taking photos with instead of asking to use mine!” —Jennifer Maldonado, associate editorial director Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray, $20 with Prime Amazon “This frizz-fighting blow dry spray is an essential part of my summer haircare lineup, so I'm stocking up while it's on sale to keep my hair looking sleek and shiny all season long — even in the worst humidity.” —Maggie Horton, shopping writer Summer Fridays Tinted Lip Butter Balm People...","Shop these editor-loved deals before the clock runs out NEED TO KNOW PEOPLE Picks is a recurring roundup of products the people behind PEOPLE Shopping actually buy. My coworkers and I on the PEOPLE shopping team collectively spend hundreds of hours a week scouring the internet for celebrity-worn fashion and deals we'd be remiss not to share with the world.

An EOS Cashmere Body Oil so silky and glow-inducing, your skin will literally look like it hopped off at hydration station. This lightweight formula melts in like butter (minus the grease), locks in moisture for 24 hours, and leaves behind a subtle yet delectable scent of ""Vanilla Cashmere."" Oh — and plot twist? That's the same scent as the internet-famous EOS lotion everyone's obsessed with. Promising review: ""I love the scent of this body oil, it wasn't too oily, it made my skin softer, it wasn't greasy at all and it's an excellent value for the money. I will definitely be buying more in the near future."" —Delina Flowers Price: $12.99 2. A dainty pair of bow earrings that'll have people asking ""OMG, where'd you get those?"" every time you wear them. Available in gold and silver, these cuties are the perfect mix of trendy and timeless — and they're under $15... a steal, IMO. Promising review: ""Obsessed!! These earrings are so stinkin' cute! They are the perfect size — not too big, but not too small, either. For my ears they didn't feel heavy to wear all day. I just love them!!"" —Danielle Sharp Furlow Price: $12.99 (available in three styles) 3. A pair of retro-inspired oval sunglasses if you want to wear a signature Miu Miu sunglass style without paying designer prices. These petite, trendy frames are giving ""celebrity in hiding"" energy, complete with UV protection and a lightweight feel. You may catch yourself wearing these at any chance you get when it's sunny out (you've been warned). Promising review: ""I bought these sunglasses because they're very trendy right now, but I didn't want to dish out an exorbitant amount of money because the frame isn't my usual. They block out the sun better than my designer sunglasses. I'm glad I bought them because they are extremely sturdy, just as pictured, and (actually?) they frame my face very nicely!"" —Addie Price: $15.99+ for two pairs (available in 29 colors and various packs) 4. A bladeless neck fan for when it's so hot you're considering becoming nocturnal. This bladeless, hands-free fan wraps around your neck and sends out a cool breeze in all directions — without messing up your hair or sounding like a jet engine. It's rechargeable, lightweight, and has different speed settings so you can control your personal chill zone as you're commuting, walking the dog, or just trying to survive summer. Promising review: ""This arrived quickly, love the color, had NO chemical or new plastic fumes, already had a bit of a charge to test it before charging it fully. I must say both [my husband and I] are impressed with the amount of power it has on all [three] settings. The sound isn't too loud for my senses, and I actually enjoy the fan sound, as it's quite soothing in a crowded space. Looking forward to having some much needed breeze relief throughout the summer!"" —Linda Price: $23.98+ (available in eight colors) 5. A hydrating E.l.f. lip balm which feels just as buttery soft as Laneige *and* has the same glossy finish to boot.

It's hydrating, lightweight, doesn't get sticky, and adds a perfect ~subtle~ gloss whether I'm using it alone or on top of a lip color.

mov_107E4EB1AF0A716F45690800785062D9,"  This post will show you the 20 must-have travel essentials to upgrade any trip. POV: you packed these 20 travel must-haves and had the best trip ever. Whether you're an avid traveler or traveling for the very first time, packing the right items can make or break your trip. And regardless of your frequent flyer status, we could all use a refresher when it comes time to pack our bags. As someone who travels frequently, I won't leave home without these 20 items that level up my travels. They are my absolute must-haves that make my trips more comfortable, more entertaining, and all around more enjoyable. No gatekeeping here! So before you catch that flight (or train, car, or boat ride), make sure you bring these essentials with you, and thank yourself later. Passport Holder If you're leaving the country, you will need a passport! This is one of the most important, if not the most important, items you will be carrying with you, so be sure to keep yours protected and in good condition by keeping it in a case. Mark & Graham Leather Personalized $49 AT MARK & GRAHAM A personalized passport case is just so chic. It will make you look and feel like a jet-setter, regardless of how much you actually travel. This faux leather passport case comes in 12 different colors and can be customized with a foil debossed or printed monogram for a personal touch. P.S. — it also makes for a thoughtful gift! RFID $13.99 AT AMAZON Not only is this passport holder super cute, affordable, and available in more than 30 different colors and prints, but it has an RFID blocking shield material inside to protect your sensitive information from potential data theft. It doesn't just hold your passport, but it also has convenient card slots that are great for storing your ID card, credit card, tickets, boarding passes, and more, plus a snap button closure to keep it all secure. BÉIS Passport & Luggage Tag $58 AT BÉIS TRAVEL BÉIS is one of the most stylish travel brands out there, so it's no su But whether or not you have a BÉIS suitcase, this set is perfect for anyone, and it can even be personalized with your initials should you choose. The passport holder and luggage tag come in a bonus clear pouch too, which is excellent for stashing your last-minute essentials and/or liquids. Travel Wallet Keep your bank cards and money secure in a functional wallet that is good for taking on the go. Compact Bifold RFID Blocking $11.99 AT AMAZON This compact bifold wallet is slim and lightweight, with compartments for cards, cash, and coins, and should be able to fit in most handbags. Most importantly, it features RFID blocking technology to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized scans. Unfortunately, pickpockets are not the only kind of thieves you need to be cautious of when traveling. The information on your payment cards can be stolen wirelessly via RFID skimming, which is why using a RFID blocking wallet is a smart way to protect your data—especially when you're far away from home. With a ton of different colors to choose from and a budget-friendly price tag, it's a great option. Zippered Passport $35 AT CALPAK Keep your passport secure along with your cards and cash in this durable travel wallet with a zipper closure. It has RFID protection lining and a protective laminate coating on the exterior to withstand travel wear. Headphones From watching Netflix to listening to your favorite music playlists, you can't forget to bring your own headphones. It will make your travel day way more enjoyable! Beats Solo 4 Wireless Bluetooth $97.99 AT AMAZON These on-ear headphones work wirelessly via Bluetooth, so no need to plug any cords into your phone, tablet, or laptop in order to tune in. They have been designed for comfort, with a lightweight, stylish design and adjustable ear cups for a stable fit. Best of all, they only require 10 minutes for five hours of playback time, so if you forgot to charge them ahead of time, you can always quickly plug in at the airport before boarding your flight.

They are my absolute must-haves that make my trips more comfortable, more entertaining, and all around more enjoyable. No gatekeeping here! So before you catch that flight (or train, car, or boat ride), make sure you bring these essentials with you, and thank yourself later. Passport Holder If you're leaving the country, you will need a passport! This is one of the most important, if not the most important, items you will be carrying with you, so be sure to keep yours protected and in good condition by keeping it in a case. Mark & Graham Leather Personalized $49 AT MARK & GRAHAM A personalized passport case is just so chic. It will make you look and feel like a jet-setter, regardless of how much you actually travel. This faux leather passport case comes in 12 different colors and can be customized with a foil debossed or printed monogram for a personal touch. P.S. — it also makes for a thoughtful gift! RFID $13.99 AT AMAZON Not only is this passport holder super cute, affordable, and available in more than 30 different colors and prints, but it has an RFID blocking shield material inside to protect your sensitive information from potential data theft.

Most importantly, it features RFID blocking technology to safeguard your personal information from unauthorized scans.

mov_DB5ED5F2AEC93350E3592F66167C5BE7,"  As we move through 2025, the phrase “finding alpha” has become the mantra for private equity (PE) investors focused on the consumer sector. Confidence in the sector remains robust, but the narrative has shifted: it is no longer about broad-based acquisition strategies. Instead, the focus is on select, high-performing assets which outperform their market—particularly those founder-led or family-owned businesses that have achieved scale and are now ripe for PE investment. Selective Opportunities and Competitive Dynamics The current environment is not characterised by indiscriminate deal-making. Rather, PE firms are zeroing in on assets with proven growth, strong cash generation, and clear market differentiation. In these cases, deal processes are bifurcated: either hyper-competitive auctions for the most attractive assets, or bilateral negotiations with founders where long-standing relationships are pivotal. While bilateral negotiations may avoid the intensity of competitive auctions, they are no less complex. Successfully executing these deals demands meticulous preparation and a high degree of emotional intelligence to ensure that investors and founders are aligned—not just on terms, but on a shared vision for growth and the path to achieving it. Most of all, over the next six months, these relationships—carefully cultivated over years—will be put to the test, as founders seek partners who can help them reach the next stage of growth. Relationship-Driven Deals and Untapped Value The consumer sector, especially segments like beauty and personal care, is seeing a surge in interest from PE. These markets have historically been underpenetrated by institutional capital, leaving significant untapped value. Recent success stories, such as Medik8 and Summer Fridays, illustrate the potential for outsized returns when PE partners with high-growth, cash-generative businesses. These companies offer rich data points on performance and scalability, making them attractive targets for investment. Operational Value Creation: Beyond Financial Engineering In today's market, simply leveraging a business and hoping for multiple expansion is no longer sufficient. Sellers are becoming increasingly creative, especially when IPO exits are not viable. Options such as continuation funds, minority stake sales, and bringing in new partners for longer hold periods are all on the table. This environment demands a hyper-focus on operational value creation. PE firms are now expected to provide meaningful operational support—ranging from strengthening executive management teams and engaging operating partners, to investing in IT and digital infrastructure. The goal is to ensure that businesses scale efficiently and sustainably, maximising both growth and value creation. The Role of Technology and Digital Transformation Technological advancement, particularly in AI and digital marketing, is a critical lever for value creation. Firms that fail to capitalise on this window risk stagnating valuations. Conversely, those that invest in digital infrastructure and data-driven marketing strategies are well-positioned for a “hockey stick” trajectory in both business performance and exit valuations. This is especially true in consumer-facing businesses, where digital engagement and personalisation are key differentiators. Creative Exit Strategies and Investor Returns With traditional exits such as IPOs less certain, PE sellers are exploring alternative strategies to return value to investors. This includes holding assets longer, selling minority stakes, or structuring continuation vehicles. Each approach requires a thoughtful evaluation of the available levers to enhance multiples and deliver returns, reinforcing the need for deep operational engagement and strategic foresight. The next six months represent a critical window for private equity in the consumer sector. The firms that will succeed are those that combine strong relationships with founders, a disciplined focus on high-performing assets, and a willingness to roll up their sleeves and drive operational improvements. In a market where cash generation and digital transformation are paramount, “finding alpha” is less about financial engineering and more about building sustainable, scalable businesses. The hard work is just beginning, but the rewards for those who get it right could be substantial.","As we move through 2025, the phrase “finding alpha” has become the mantra for private equity (PE) investors focused on the consumer sector.
