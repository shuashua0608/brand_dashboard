mov_122E6FE7AC2F0976B5601CF900BF5B47,"  Get classics from Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani for up to 30% off. Buying fragrances online is already a gamble. If you're pushing the boat out on a new oud or something summery, you want to smell it in person, especially since fragrances returns can be a pain in the ass. But the way Amazon and its Prime Day sale are set up is an even bigger pain in the ass. The section is growing, but right now only some brands and some fragrances are sold by Amazon directly and come with the reassurance that you're buying the real deal. But a lot of bottles are sold by third-party sellers, where discounts are big, but there's no way to know what you're getting before it shows up. It's unlikely you'll get scammed, but you have to be vigilant. Don't try to buy the best colognes out now during Prime Day. Stick to reputable names with a dedicated storefront, and accept that you'll have to buy Terre d'Hermès for retail price. Right now, the best Amazon deals on colognes come from two legends of the game that paved the way for mass-market domination: Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani. Both houses have dedicated Amazon storefronts selling their classic colognes for around 30 percent off. Neither Polo Original or Acqua di Giò are going to win fragrance awards, sure, but they're still wonderful daily drivers and make great gifts. Beyond the variations of those two, you can get Calvin Klein's CK One and selects from David Beckham's line of fragrances for up to 40 percent off. Again, I'd skip the designer stuff, just because Amazon isn't an authorized seller in that world, so it's a bit like the Wild West. Stick to these mass-market hits, so you can save up for a freaky fragrance purchase later in the year. Giorgio Armani Acqua di Giò – Eau de Parfum I usually prefer to get an eau de parfum, just for the sake of sillage and longevity. But in this case, I really do prefer the eau de parfum to the eau de toillette. The muskiness gets cut down for something that feels really fresh and sea-inspired. Giorgio Armani Acqua di Giò - Eau de Toilette But the eau de toilette is the classic. It's the perfect seaside citrus and musk. It might remind you of the '90s, but this style of fragrance is as popular as it's ever been. (As seen by releases like Ranger Station's Rich '90s Dad.) Ralph Lauren Polo The perfect first cologne, the perfect everyday cologne—Ralph Lauren Polo is as good as it gets for a lot of guys. It's one that might get overlooked as old fashioned these days, but no one is going to say woodsy tobacco smells bad. Keep this one stocked. Stetson Original Talking about old fashioned, I shouted out the current Stetson Original in our cologne awards, and it's one I'll always stand by. It's a classic musk. Starts herbal, then moves to amber, and dries down with a sweet amber-y musk. This is what my grandpa smelt like going to church, and these days that's one of the coolest things I can think of. Calvin Klein CK One For me, CK One and Acqua di Giò fight for the top spot in that '90s fresh category. I prefer Armani just because it leans more salty and marine. But CK One is a really solid pick if you prefer something greener. Instead of going citrus into sea salt air, CK One is citrusy to start and finishes with a little bit of amber but mostly green leaves. Also, the lack of musk compared to Armani makes this a more unisex option, in my opinion. David Beckham Refined Woods, Eau de Parfum I'm a Beckham lover. I spent untold hours trying to replicate that freekick against Greece when I was a kid. But I rolled my eyes when he came out with his fragrance collection. Jokes on me, because it's really good, one of my favorite value fragrance lines. None of it reinvents the wheel, but I have a real love for Refined Woods. It's simple: decent longevity vetiver and cedar wood with some spices mixed in at the front. (The brand calls out cardamom and clary sage, but I really get anise.) It's simple, straightforward, and affordable. Can't beat it. David Beckham Infinite Aqua, Eau de Parfum...","Get classics from Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani for up to 30% off.
