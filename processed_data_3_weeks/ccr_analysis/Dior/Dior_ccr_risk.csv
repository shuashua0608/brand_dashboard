1lr893b,"  Hey everyone! Just wanted to take a moment to thank this amazing community, you've all helped me so much over the past few months. The passion, knowledge, and honest feedback here really guided me through my fragrance journey. In the last 4 months, I went all in tried over 150+ decants, visited a few local perfumeries, and explored and owned tons of perfume oils beyond what I'm sharing in this post. After a lot of research (and a bit of obsession), I ended up collecting these fragrances, and let's just say… it became quite the addiction! That said, I've decided to hit pause and not buy any more fragrances for the rest of the year (with one exception that might arrive in the next couple of days). I'll still be around and happy to help anyone here however I can. Thanks again for being such a great part of this journey! **Note**: I am not an expert , I trust my nose more than reviews, please do research or test fragrances before you buy, I am from Middle east / Asia English is not my native language, I apologize in advance for any mistakes i try to explain this in my words without using any AI or correction tool. I am reviewing all fragrances after giving them time to mature. From Top Left to Right: 1. **Icon by Dunhill**: Really Good citrusy, Aromatic and floral scent. A good alternative for those who don't like sweet or overly citrusy scents for summer. 2. **1 Million Prive:** The most complimented one on my list, absolutely amazing winter scent with sweet and tobacco notes; I failed to find anything that can beat that fragrance. 3. **1 Million Elixir:** Very sweet and creamy vanilla with colorful floral tones, especially on the dry down. Lasts a long time and projection is strong. **4. **   **Jasoor:** Clone of VUBIR Coral Fantasy Long Lasting with Good projection, Very Versatile for year-round wear except very hot evenings. **5. **   **Asad Bourbon:** Clone that covers VUBIR Intense, Most Wanted and Stronger with you. Smells cozy and rich. Feels confident and warm. **6. **   **Khamrah :** Amazing Scent, Sweet,  Warm , Cozy with Vanilla and amber. 7. **Khamrah Dukhan:** I tried Liquid Burn, and to my nose, it smells quite similar that same warm, spicy DNA. But Khamrah Dukhan was much cheaper, so I went for it. It's incredibly long-lasting and feels like a spicier, less sweet version of Khamrah. If the sweetness in the original Khamrah isn't your thing, this might be a better fit. Honestly, it's underrated and didn't get the recognition it deserves from early buyers or reviewers. This one needs more attention, it's a hidden gem. 8. **Alpine Homme Sport**: Clone of Allure Homme Sport, as a Sporty scent both last 4-5 hours, and it's enough for a sports session, very good gym scent. 9. **CDN Precieux:** Clone of Aventus Absolu with Twist, Great performance and quality scent better and smoother when compared with Supremacy CE but costs more and feel more expensive **10. ** **Mont Blanc Starwalker:** absolute masterpiece a good night time / bedtime scent. Calming and relaxing, Hyped for a reason very unique scent. **11. ** **Dunhill Desire for a man:** Apple, Citrus and Rose based scent, classic cheap summer scent suitable for any age. 12. **L'Homme by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of L'Homme Lacoste, long lasting, sweet, citrusy fresh scent. FD is a small local perfumery in my area. 13. **L'Homme Intense by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of Dior Homme Intense, Dior Homme intense clones were mostly sold out and its hard to get them in my country so i visited a local perfumery where they had this clone its using same french oils used by other clone houses. I tried it it was very long lasting so i bought the bottle, during testing it last 12+ hours on my skin. 14....","Hey everyone!

mov_9433D0C7388B6DF27BE7BD401114AF99,"  We took a deep dive into murky online beauty markets to find out what's being sold, how they are being sold, and why so many people are buying them What happens when you live in India with no cousins abroad and a desperate craving for Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip treatment? Or when you're obsessed with the quirky monster doll, Labubu, that everyone on social media seems to own? For some, the answer is simple: don't buy it. But for others - especially those stubborn, brand-loving souls - Indian markets have found a workaround. If you can't get the first copy, just buy the fifth one. And no, these aren't dupes with witty name changes or altered packaging. These are full-blown counterfeits: same branding, identical packaging, but at a mere fraction of the price. We took a deep dive into these murky online markets to find out what's being sold, how they are being sold, and more importantly, why so many people are buying them. But before we unpack all that, let's rewind a bit. The Rise Of India's Counterfeit Culture Counterfeit goods aren't new in India. They've existed in various forms for decades. When globalisation opened the floodgates to international brands, a majority of Indians found themselves unable to afford the real thing. The demand was high, but supply (at least the genuine kind) was out of reach. Naturally, the market responded in its own cheeky way. Think of places like D'manoj Pizza knocking off Domino's. Even when Domino's caught wind of the viral video of their doppelganger, their response was just as cheeky: ""Yahan ka address milega? (Can we get the address?)"" (Not a copyright claim) Today, that spirit has spilled across industries, from fast food to fashion to beauty. Markets like Sarojini Nagar in Delhi, Esplanade in Kolkata and Linking Road in Mumbai are prime examples, brimming with off-brand versions of luxury items. These IRL knock-offs often tweak a letter here, a logo there, or at least get the shade of lipstick slightly off. For beauty products though, the compromises run deeper - especially when it comes to ingredients and safety. But the game has changed online. Unlike the local bazaar, where, you know you're buying a knock-off, e-commerce marketplaces and social media are now peddling products that look identical to the original. Meesho, Facebook Marketplace, Amazon, Instagram... everyone is on it, and everyone is in on it. How These Fake Markets Operate Meesho Meesho is notorious (and simultaneously beloved) for offering bargain-basement prices. The brand claims this is possible because it eliminates middlemen, connects resellers directly to manufacturers, and focuses on lesser-known brands. But this has created the perfect breeding ground for fake products - especially viral beauty items. Take Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip treatment, for instance. Not officially available in India, but somehow being sold on Meesho for less than Rs 500. We even found fake Dior and Gisou lip oils, sold in nearly identical packaging but with slightly altered names. Facebook Marketplace It might not be trending in urban Gen Z circles, but Facebook Marketplace (FMP) is still massive. With over a billion global users shopping every month, it's a hotspot for everything from houseplants to handbags - and now, counterfeit beauty products in India. It's not just about fake luxury either. Some sellers offer bizarrely cheap prices for products that shouldn't even be in India, let alone available at that price. The sheer scale of the platform makes it easy for scamsters to thrive with little scrutiny. Instagram Instagram, Meta's glamorous baby, has become a thriving hub for small business sellers, even in India. Unfortunately, many of them are hawking knock-off makeup and skincare products via Reels. Some don't even bother to change the names-they rely on flashy visuals and discounted prices to hook unsuspecting users. The perfume industry is especially saturated with counterfeit sellers offering half-price on these bottles that may look legit but aren't even close.

Meesho, Facebook Marketplace, Instagram, Amazon… सब पर नकली चीजें बिक रही हैं. और सबसे बड़ी बात - लोग खरीद भी रहे हैं. Meesho Meesho पर सस्ते सामान की भरमार है. कंपनी कहती है कि ये सीधे मैन्युफैक्चरर से सामान दिलवाते हैं. पर असल में ये नकली प्रोडक्ट्स का अड्डा बन गया है, खासतौर पर ब्यूटी प्रोडक्ट्स का. Hailey Bieber की Rhode Lip Treatment जो इंडिया में आती ही नहीं, Meesho पर सिर्फ 500 रुपए में मिल रही है. यहां तक कि Dior और Gisou के भी नकली लिप ऑयल्स मिल जाते हैं, बस नाम में हल्का सा फर्क. Facebook Marketplace Facebook Marketplace भी पीछे नहीं है. यहां घर के पौधों से लेकर हैंडबैग्स तक सब बिकता है - अब नकली ब्यूटी प्रोडक्ट्स भी. यहां इतने सस्ते दाम में प्रोडक्ट्स मिलते हैं कि यकीन करना मुश्किल हो जाए. Instagram Instagram भी अब नकली मेकअप बेचने वालों का हॉटस्पॉट बन गया है. यहां Reels के जरिए लोग बिना नाम बदले ही ब्रांड्स की हूबहू कॉपी बेच रहे हैं. खासतौर पर परफ्यूम्स में नकली सामान की भरमार है.

Online Beauty Market Truth: सोचिए, आप इंडिया में रहते हैं. आपकी ख्वाहिश है कि आप दुनिया का बेस्‍ट लिप ट्रीटमेंट करवा सकें. लेकिन आपके पास न तो कोई रिश्तेदार है जो विदेश में रहता है और न ही आपके पास हजारों रुपए का हैली बीबर का रोड लिप ट्रीटमेंट खरीदने का बजट है. मेकअप (Online Makeup Kit) की बात न करके दूसरे प्रोडक्ट्स की बात करते हैं. जैसे हो सकता है आपको सोशल मीडिया पर वायरल हो रहे उस अजीब से दिखने वाले Labubu Monster Doll से प्यार हो गया है, जो हर किसी के पास है. लेकिन ये इतनी महंगी है कि आप अफोर्ड नहीं करना चाहते तो आप क्या करेंगे. कुछ लोग आपको सलाह देंगे कि बजट नहीं है तो खरीदना ही क्यों? लेकिन कुछ लोग ऐसे होते हैं जो जिद्दी और ब्रांड्स के दीवाने होते हैं. उनके लिए इंडिया में एक तरीका मिल ही जाता है. असली चीज नहीं मिल रही? कोई बात नहीं, उसकी नकल यानी कॉपी (Beauty Product First Copy) मिल जाएगी. जिसे डुप्लीकेट नहीं कहा जा सकता. ये पूरी की पूरी नकली चीजें होती हैं, जिसमें वही ब्रांडिंग, वही पैकिंग होती है, बस दाम एकदम सस्ते होते हैं. ऑनलाइन मार्केट में ये चीजें भरी पड़ी है. एनडीटीवी ने ऑनलाइन मार्केट की तहत तक जाकर इन चीजों का खंगाला और जाना कि लोग क्या खरीद रहे हैं. यकीन मानिए बहुत दिलचस्प फेक्ट्स निकलकर सामने आए इंडिया में नकली सामानों का पुराना खेल (Fake Beauty Product Online) भारत में नकली सामान कोई नई बात नहीं है. जब ग्लोबल ब्रांड्स इंडिया में आए, तो असली सामान का सपना देखना भी महंगा हो गया. जब मांग ज्यादा थी, लेकिन असली चीजें दूर थीं, तो बाजार ने भी अपनी 'देसी जुगाड़' लगा दी. जैसे D'manoj Pizza, जो Domino's Pizza की हूबहू कॉपी था. जब Domino's को पता चला, तो उन्होंने भी इस पर मजेदार रिएक्शन दिया और लिखा, ""भाई, इसका एड्रेस मिलेगा?"" आज ये खेल हर इंडस्ट्री में फैल चुका है - फूड से लेकर फैशन और ब्यूटी तक. दिल्ली का सरोजिनी नगर, कोलकाता का एस्प्लानेड, मुंबई का लिंकिंग रोड - हर जगह ब्रांड्स की नकली कॉपी खुलेआम बिकती हैं. यहां दुकानदार थोड़ी सी स्पेलिंग बदल देते हैं, लोगो थोड़ा घुमा देते हैं या लिपस्टिक का शेड हल्का बदल देते हैं. लेकिन ब्यूटी प्रोडक्ट्स में मामला खतरनाक होता है, क्योंकि यहां सिर्फ लुक्स नहीं, सेहत भी जुड़ी होती है. ऑनलाइन मार्केट में अब खेल ज्यादा बड़ा है अब तो गेम ऑनलाइन शिफ्ट हो गया है. पहले लोकल मार्केट में पता रहता था कि आप नकली चीज़ खरीद रहे हैं, पर ऑनलाइन सब कुछ असली जैसा लगता है. Meesho, Facebook Marketplace, Instagram, Amazon… सब पर नकली चीजें बिक रही हैं. और सबसे बड़ी बात - लोग खरीद भी रहे हैं. Meesho Meesho पर सस्ते सामान की भरमार है. कंपनी कहती है कि ये सीधे मैन्युफैक्चरर से सामान दिलवाते हैं. पर असल में ये नकली प्रोडक्ट्स का अड्डा बन गया है, खासतौर पर ब्यूटी प्रोडक्ट्स का. Hailey Bieber की Rhode Lip Treatment जो इंडिया में आती ही नहीं, Meesho पर सिर्फ 500 रुपए में मिल रही है. यहां तक कि Dior और Gisou के भी नकली लिप ऑयल्स मिल जाते हैं, बस नाम में हल्का सा फर्क. Facebook Marketplace Facebook Marketplace भी पीछे नहीं है. यहां घर के पौधों से लेकर हैंडबैग्स तक सब बिकता है - अब नकली ब्यूटी प्रोडक्ट्स भी. यहां इतने सस्ते दाम में प्रोडक्ट्स मिलते हैं कि यकीन करना मुश्किल हो जाए. Instagram Instagram भी अब नकली मेकअप बेचने वालों का हॉटस्पॉट बन गया है. यहां Reels के जरिए लोग बिना नाम बदले ही ब्रांड्स की हूबहू कॉपी बेच रहे हैं. खासतौर पर परफ्यूम्स में नकली सामान की भरमार है.
