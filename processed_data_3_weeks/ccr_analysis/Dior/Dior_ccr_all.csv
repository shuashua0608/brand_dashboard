mov_140AD8ECB8F029D4AF306C03BEC0D836,"  Moncler teams up with Donald Glover for an Ojai-inspired collection, Regen Projects presents Kevin Beasley's “What delineates the edge,” FIFA celebrates the debut of its ready-to-wear brand in Beverly Hills and Eleventy Milano opens at South Coast Plaza Moncler teams up with Donald Glover for an Ojai-inspired collection Luxury fashion brand Moncler has teamed up with Emmy-winning actor and Grammy-winning musician Donald Glover on a new Genius collection inspired by Gilga Farm, his creative hub and retreat located in Ojai, California. Titled Moncler x Gilga Farm, the collection reinterprets Moncler's alpine heritage through a Californian lens, blending the brand's mountain wear DNA with Glover's focus on functionality, comfort and everyday usefulness. The collection includes quilted jackets, technical linen canvas, wool-cashmere knits, lightweight ripstop windbreakers and a standout burnt orange suede jacket. Other key pieces include oversized workwear-inspired layers, shorts, cotton tees and a convertible duvet jacket that transforms into a sleeping bag — a reference to Moncler's original sleeping bag product. The pieces are designed to be wearable in transitional weather, balancing practicality with relaxed style. Colorways are inspired by the Ojai Valley landscape and Gilga Farm's surroundings, featuring washed pinks, creams, oranges and pale blues. Natural-feel fabrics are used throughout and orange fiber — a nod to Gilga's citrus groves — is woven into select garments. The orange also appears as a recurring motif in logos and design accents. Footwear includes a simplified version of the Moncler Trailgrip Vela sandal, made from cotton ribbon and leather and finished with a pale pink Vibram sole. The collaboration also introduces playful design elements, including patches, comic strip graphics and a reimagined version of Moncler's Monduck mascot, shown as a farmer character across the collection. Animated care labels — voiced by Glover — reference the Monduck tag found in his first Moncler jacket, blending personal storytelling with brand heritage. “Functionality is key — it's something that connects the world of Gilga and Moncler,” Glover said of the collaboration. “We both create for real-world usefulness.” The campaign features a short animated film in which a cartoon version of Glover falls asleep at Gilga Farm and dreams of a Moncler alpine landscape, illustrating the merging of both worlds. Moncler x Gilga Farm is available now at select Moncler locations and online at moncler.com. A new book and exhibit explore Christian Dior's floral inspiration A new book titled “Dior Enchanting Gardens” explores the central role that nature, gardens and flowers have played in the creative universe of Christian Dior and the legacy of the house he founded. Published by Rizzoli, the volume traces Dior's lifelong fascination with the natural world, which began in his childhood home, Villa Les Rhumbs in Granville, and extended to other private residences including the Château de La Colle Noire in Montauroux and the Moulin du Coudret in Milly-la-Forêt. These locations and their gardens are presented chapter by chapter, offering insight into how they influenced both Dior's personal life and creative output. Flowers were a key inspiration for Dior from the start — notably in his 1947 New Look collection, which featured the Corolle line, and in the creation of Miss Dior, his first fragrance. The book connects these early inspirations to the work of Dior's artistic successors, including Maria Grazia Chiuri, showing how floral motifs have remained a defining element of the brand's aesthetic through decades of couture and fragrance design. Alongside text contributions, the book features rare archival documents and photographs by leading fashion photographers such as Henry Clarke, Patrick Demarchelier, Brigitte Niedermair and Paolo Roversi. Garments are shown alongside Dior's most iconic fragrances in a visual and historical survey that spans from the original femme-fleur silhouette to contemporary designs. “Dior Enchanting Gardens” includes a preface by Jean-Paul Claverie, an introduction by Brigitte Richart and essays by contributors including Philippe Deliau, Amy de La Haye, Vincent Leret, Barbara Jeauffroy-Mairet and Coline Zellal. The book is a companion to the exhibition of the same name, running at the Musée Christian Dior in Granville, France through Nov. 2. “Synth II” by Kevin Beasley (Source: Regen Projects) Regen Projects presents Kevin Beasley's “What delineates the edge” Artist Kevin Beasley returns to Regen Projects this summer with “What delineates the edge,” his second solo exhibition at the gallery. Known for his sculptural work that fuses found materials with experimental processes, Beasley continues his exploration of memory, materiality and spatial form through a new series of wall-mounted slabs and freestanding sculptures. The exhibition centers on the idea of thresholds — both literal and metaphorical — bringing together personal and cultural references. Using his signature cast resin technique, Beasley incorporates objects such as bedsheets, military uniforms, hats, carbon fiber, denim and shoes into sculptural screens that function like movable partitions. These works act as armatures for meaning, creating porous, layered boundaries that invite viewers to navigate the space through improvisation. Also on view are Beasley's “Synths” — large resin panels embedded with items like raw cotton, chipped pool cues, PPE components and T-shirts. The compositions reference both Beasley's personal history growing up in Virginia and broader cultural narratives, with the materials sometimes clearly visible and other times obscured. The title, drawn from musical synthesizers, reflects the work's aim to translate memory and emotion into visual form. The show follows Beasley's recent large-scale installation at Storm King Art Center and recent exhibitions at the Walker Art Center and the 15th Gwangju Biennale. His work is held in major public collections including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Tate Modern in London and the Art Institute of Chicago. “What delineates the edge” is on view at Regen Projects, 6750 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90038, from July 2 to Aug. 16. Reformation x StyledSara debut the Sara Linen Dress Reformation, the cult-favorite Los Angeles label known for its effortlessly feminine silhouettes and commitment to sustainability, has launched a new collaboration with stylist and fashion consultant Sara Walker. The Sara Linen Dress is a ladylike midi crafted from 100% linen, complete with scalloped trim and buckle details that channel Walker's deep archive of fashion references. “I designed a piece that feels effortless and flattering, but still packed with personality,” she said. “The scalloped trim was inspired by a 1960s fashion magazine I've kept for years, and the buckle details are a subtle wink to a '90s runway moment I've never forgotten.” The dress will be available in three distinct colorways: Stampede, a chocolate brown zebra print; Nectarine, a coral-and-orange colorblock; and Parmesan, a soft yellow with crisp white accents. To celebrate the launch, Walker hosted an intimate lunch at the Chateau Marmont earlier this month. Guests including Tezza, Angela Fink, Gab Waller and Liv Perez all wore the new design, styled their own way — a fitting tribute to Reformation's blend of timeless appeal and individual expression. This collaboration follows a string of successful partnerships for the brand, which has previously teamed up with fashion and culture tastemakers like Kacey Musgraves, D.. .","Moncler teams up with Donald Glover for an Ojai-inspired collection, Regen Projects presents Kevin Beasley's “What delineates the edge,” FIFA celebrates the debut of its ready-to-wear brand in Beverly Hills and Eleventy Milano opens at South Coast Plaza Moncler teams up with Donald Glover for an Ojai-inspired collection Luxury fashion brand Moncler has teamed up with Emmy-winning actor and Grammy-winning musician Donald Glover on a new Genius collection inspired by Gilga Farm, his creative hub and retreat located in Ojai, California.

Titled Moncler x Gilga Farm, the collection reinterprets Moncler's alpine heritage through a Californian lens, blending the brand's mountain wear DNA with Glover's focus on functionality, comfort and everyday usefulness. The collection includes quilted jackets, technical linen canvas, wool-cashmere knits, lightweight ripstop windbreakers and a standout burnt orange suede jacket. Other key pieces include oversized workwear-inspired layers, shorts, cotton tees and a convertible duvet jacket that transforms into a sleeping bag — a reference to Moncler's original sleeping bag product. The pieces are designed to be wearable in transitional weather, balancing practicality with relaxed style. Colorways are inspired by the Ojai Valley landscape and Gilga Farm's surroundings, featuring washed pinks, creams, oranges and pale blues. Natural-feel fabrics are used throughout and orange fiber — a nod to Gilga's citrus groves — is woven into select garments. The orange also appears as a recurring motif in logos and design accents. Footwear includes a simplified version of the Moncler Trailgrip Vela sandal, made from cotton ribbon and leather and finished with a pale pink Vibram sole. The collaboration also introduces playful design elements, including patches, comic strip graphics and a reimagined version of Moncler's Monduck mascot, shown as a farmer character across the collection. Animated care labels — voiced by Glover — reference the Monduck tag found in his first Moncler jacket, blending personal storytelling with brand heritage. “Functionality is key — it's something that connects the world of Gilga and Moncler,” Glover said of the collaboration. “We both create for real-world usefulness.” The campaign features a short animated film in which a cartoon version of Glover falls asleep at Gilga Farm and dreams of a Moncler alpine landscape, illustrating the merging of both worlds. Moncler x Gilga Farm is available now at select Moncler locations and online at moncler.com. Source: Dior A new book and exhibit explore Christian Dior's floral inspiration A new book titled “Dior Enchanting Gardens” explores the central role that nature, gardens and flowers have played in the creative universe of Christian Dior and the legacy of the house he founded. Published by Rizzoli, the volume traces Dior's lifelong fascination with the natural world, which began in his childhood home, Villa Les Rhumbs in Granville, and extended to other private residences including the Château de La Colle Noire in Montauroux and the Moulin du Coudret in Milly-la-Forêt. These locations and their gardens are presented chapter by chapter, offering insight into how they influenced both Dior's personal life and creative output. More in Style Flowers were a key inspiration for Dior from the start — notably in his 1947 New Look collection, which featured the Corolle line, and in the creation of Miss Dior, his first fragrance. The book connects these early inspirations to the work of Dior's artistic successors, including Maria Grazia Chiuri, showing how floral motifs have remained a defining element of the brand's aesthetic through decades of couture and fragrance design. Alongside text contributions, the book features rare archival documents and photographs by leading fashion photographers such as Henry Clarke, Patrick Demarchelier, Brigitte Niedermair and Paolo Roversi. Garments are shown alongside Dior's most iconic fragrances in a visual and historical survey that spans from the original femme-fleur silhouette to contemporary designs. “Dior Enchanting Gardens” includes a preface by Jean-Paul Claverie, an introduction by Brigitte Richart and essays by contributors including Philippe Deliau, Amy de La Haye, Vincent Leret, Barbara Jeauffroy-Mairet and Coline Zellal. The book is a companion to the exhibition of the same name, running at the Musée Christian Dior in Granville, France through Nov. 2. “Synth II” by Kevin Beasley (Source: Regen Projects) Regen Projects presents Kevin Beasley's “What delineates the edge” Artist Kevin Beasley returns to Regen Projects this summer with “What delineates the edge,” his second solo exhibition at the gallery. Known for his sculptural work that fuses found materials with experimental processes, Beasley continues his exploration of memory, materiality and spatial form through a new series of wall-mounted slabs and freestanding sculptures. The exhibition centers on the idea of thresholds — both literal and metaphorical — bringing together personal and cultural references. Using his signature cast resin technique, Beasley incorporates objects such as bedsheets, military uniforms, hats, carbon fiber, denim and shoes into sculptural screens that function like movable partitions. These works act as armatures for meaning, creating porous, layered boundaries that invite viewers to navigate the space through improvisation. Also on view are Beasley's “Synths” — large resin panels embedded with items like raw cotton, chipped pool cues, PPE components and T-shirts. The compositions reference both Beasley's personal history growing up in Virginia and broader cultural narratives, with the materials sometimes clearly visible and other times obscured. The title, drawn from musical synthesizers, reflects the work's aim to translate memory and emotion into visual form. The show follows Beasley's recent large-scale installation at Storm King Art Center and recent exhibitions at the Walker Art Center and the 15th Gwangju Biennale. His work is held in major public collections including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Tate Modern in London and the Art Institute of Chicago. “What delineates the edge” is on view at Regen Projects, 6750 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90038, from July 2 to Aug. 16.

La diva del pop aparece con un estilo que fusiona elegancia, intelectualidad y moda genderless en una producción dirigida por el fotógrafo Alex Córdoba . “Indómita”, su quinto álbum de estudio, se lanzó el 5 de junio a través de Warner Music luego de 12 años sin un LP, y debutó en el #1 en México, #12 en Latin Pop Albums de Billboard y #8 en el Top Global Albums . El disco incluye colaboraciones de alto nivel con Natanael Cano, Kenia Os, Jared Leto (Thirty Seconds to Mars) y Natanael Cano, fusionando géneros como pop, corrido tumbado, urbano y regional . “Mentiras, la serie”, producción musical de Prime Video, se estrenó el 13 de junio y ya es la serie más vista en México . Su banda sonora acumula más de 2.4 millones de reproducciones, y revivió clásicos de los 80: Daniela Romo (+170 %), Amanda Miguel (+94 %), Yuri (+64 %) y Lupita D'Alessio (+90 %) . En entrevistas recientes, Belinda destacó que su enfoque creativo para Indómita surgió directamente del concepto: “indómita”, nombre que definió la fuerza interior que la guía . Respecto a “Mentiras”, comentó que no buscó imitar a las voces originales, sino reinterpretar las canciones desde la autenticidad de cada actriz, un sello que la diferenció . Para Elle, Belinda adopta un look que rompe esquemas:     Camisa de rayas (COS) con corbata negra satinada (Dolce & Gabbana), tacones Dior combinados con calcetines, gafas Tommy Hilfiger y reloj Hublot . También presume un smoking sofisticado y un conjunto total look Miu Miu en tonos tierra, reflejando una estética andrógina que juega con lo masculino y femenino . El resultado es una portada que subraya su poderío estilístico y musical, en medio de una reinvención artística que trasciende géneros. Belinda —quien despegó en los años 2000 con telenovelas como Cómplices al rescate, Patito feo y el disco Catarsis (2013)— se consolidó como un icono de moda y música latina . Tras una etapa de colaboraciones y un breve receso, su regreso con “Indómita” y “Mentiras” marca un renacer que ha sido celebrado por críticos y público por igual. Con su portada en Elle, Belinda refleja en imágenes el momento artístico más audaz de su carrera.

mov_576D4B5C0CDA9AF301121FD9F6CBA3B4,"  by 01/07/2025 Paris Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2026 has concluded, leaving a lasting impression with a blend of established luxury and innovative design. From Dior's intriguing new direction to Hermès' focus on sophisticated city living, and the playful energy of KidSuper, the menswear collections showcased a diverse range of aesthetics. This season wasn't just about clothes; it was about storytelling, cultural references, and a subtle shift towards comfort and practicality without sacrificing elegance. The shows signaled a move beyond strict formality, embracing a more relaxed yet refined approach to menswear. Dior's Artistic Evolution and a Nod to Wes Anderson Kim Jones' latest collection for Dior presented a compelling new chapter for the iconic house. The collection drew heavily from the aesthetic of the zoot suit, a bold and historically significant style. This unexpected inspiration was executed with Dior's signature tailoring and attention to detail, resulting in a collection that felt both fresh and respectful of its roots. Notably, the show featured a distinct visual echo of Wes Anderson's cinematic style – symmetrical staging and a carefully curated color palette – adding a layer of playful intellectualism. CNN provides a detailed look at the show's key moments. Hermès: The Modern Gentleman's Urban Wardrobe Hermès continued its tradition of understated luxury with a collection designed for the modern city dweller. The emphasis was on versatile pieces crafted from high-quality materials, offering a sophisticated yet effortless style. Silhouettes were relaxed and comfortable, prioritizing ease of movement and practicality. The color palette was muted and refined, reflecting a sense of quiet confidence. Nation.com.pk highlights the collection's focus on comfort and ease. Beyond the Big Names: KidSuper and Ziggy Chen Offer Fresh Perspectives While Dior and Hermès dominated headlines, other designers brought unique visions to the Paris runways. KidSuper presented a whimsical, fairytale-inspired collection, injecting a dose of playful creativity into the menswear landscape. Ziggy Chen, on the other hand, focused on lightness and breathability, utilizing linen fabrics to create a relaxed and airy aesthetic. These emerging designers demonstrate the evolving nature of menswear and the growing demand for individuality and self-expression. FashionUnited.uk provides a comprehensive overview of these and other standout shows. What does this shift towards more relaxed and versatile menswear signify for the future of fashion? And how will established houses like Dior continue to balance tradition with innovation? The Broader Trends Shaping Menswear in 2026 The Paris menswear shows weren't just about individual collections; they reflected broader trends shaping the industry. A key takeaway is the increasing importance of sustainability and ethical production. Designers are under growing pressure to minimize their environmental impact and prioritize fair labor practices. This is leading to a greater focus on durable materials, timeless designs, and responsible sourcing. Another significant trend is the blurring of lines between formal and informal wear. Men are increasingly seeking clothing that can seamlessly transition from the office to social settings. This has resulted in a demand for versatile pieces that can be dressed up or down. Finally, the rise of personalization and customization is empowering consumers to express their individuality through their clothing choices. Brands are responding by offering bespoke services and allowing customers to create unique, one-of-a-kind garments. Hermès' Summer 2026 collection, with its emphasis on refined simplicity, perfectly encapsulates these trends. DA MAN Magazine details the collection's focus on a modern city wardrobe. Similarly, 10 Magazine offers a concise overview of Hermès' SS26 menswear presentation.

mov_9D69E3A642C81C8B1FF9B627C5EF6351,"  SPR_COMBO[ru]Зачем люди собираются в книжные клубы и как они устроены В последние годы книжная индустрия находится в своем расцвете. Сегодня книги стали незаменимой частью массовой культуры: селебрити охотно позируют с новинками на камеру,  а бренды включают их в маркетинговые кампании. Некоторые просто начали скупать книги, чтобы казаться умнее и привлекательнее — одни ставят их как фон для видеозвонков, другие берут их с собой на прогулку как красивый аксессуар.   Книжные клубы также становятся новой популярной формой досуга. Все больше знаменитостей запускают свои читательские сообщества, где ежемесячно предлагают новую книгу и обсуждают ее с подписчиками.  Впрочем, сегодня, чтобы стать участником клуба, не нужно быть фанатом конкретной звезды — тематические сообщества легко найти как в офлайне, так и онлайн. Их создают книжные магазины, издательства, культурные пространства и просто любители литературы. Фото: Ugur Akdemir / Unsplash Механика книжных клубов довольно проста: участники заранее договариваются, какую книгу читают, а затем собираются, чтобы обсудить прочитанное. Формат встреч может быть любым — от офлайн-собраний в кафе до регулярных Zoom-сессий. Иногда книги читают вслух прямо на встречах. Обычно разговор ведет модератор — он помогает структурировать обсуждение, предлагает вопросы и следит за ходом беседы. В некоторых клубах к встречам присоединяются гости — авторы, переводчики, редакторы или книжные блогеры. Как зародились книжные клубы Идея собираться вместе, чтобы обсуждать книги, уходит корнями в античность. Еще в школе Сократа ученики рассуждали не только о литературе, но и о философии, политике и природе человека. Более привычный для нас формат появился позже — одним из первых стал клуб «Джунто», основанный Бенджамином Франклином в XVIII веке. Участники встречались по пятницам, чтобы говорить о литературе, а также организовали общественные проекты. Коммерческая модель книжного клуба появилась в 1926 году. Американец Гарри Шерман придумал подписной сервис Little Leather Library — за $2,98 читатели получали 30 небольших книг и шоколад в подарок. Позже проект перерос в клуб «Книга месяца», где редакторы выбирали важные произведения и рассылали их подписчикам.  Современный всплеск популярности начался в 1996 году, когда телеведущая Опра Уинфри запустила собственный книжный клуб. В рамках своей передачи она рекомендовала новинки, обсуждала их со зрителями и авторами. Проект стал настолько успешным, что вскоре за ним последовали другие знаменитости.  Сейчас книжные клубы есть у Сары Джессики Паркер, Дуа Липы и Риз Уизерспун. Последний — Reese's Book Club — стал настоящим феноменом: книги, попадающие в его список, неизменно становятся бестселлерами на годы. Только в 2023 году ее рекомендации разошлись тиражом более 2,3 миллиона экземпляров. Фото: Face to Face / Global Look Press К книжным клубам подключились и модные бренды. В 2024 году Miu Miu провел первую встречу своего литературного клуба в Милане, собрав представителей индустрии, журналистов и медийных персон. Chanel развивает проект Les Rendez-vous littéraires rue Cambon,  где они знакомят читателей с женской литературой. Dior также не остался в стороне — бренд посвящает литературе специальные мероприятия, приуроченные к новым коллекциям. Чем объясняется популярность книжных сообществ сегодня В мире, где цифровые технологии вытесняют живое общение, а ощущение одиночества становится все более распространенным, особенно среди молодежи, людям все чаще требуется так называемое «третье место» — пространство, отличное от дома и работы, где можно регулярно встречаться и общаться.  Книжные клубы как раз стали такой площадкой. Они дают возможность обсуждать прочитанное в кругу единомышленников, высказывать мнение, слушать других и развивать критическое мышление. Это не только способ взглянуть на текст под новым углом, но и повод выработать привычку к регулярному чтению и вдумчивому восприятию информации. Популярность литературных сообществ сегодня усиливается за счет внимания со стороны известных персон. Книги все чаще появляются в руках у селебрити, а книжные рекомендации становятся частью публичного образа.  Кроме того, важную роль сыграли социальные сети. В TikTok активно развивается сообщество BookTok, где пользователи делятся короткими отзывами, подборками, инсайтами и участвуют в литературных челленджах. Это вовлекло в чтение новую аудиторию и сделало обсуждение книг популярным форматом досуга.

mov_B402EA5EE4760D18ED2A55288151EEE0,"  SPR_COMBO[da]Vi er gået i DRTV's blandselv-afdeling og har sammensat den mest forrygende pose blandede bolsjer til dig. Der er lidt af hvert – lige fra hylende morsomt feministisk hævntogt til en ikonisk western, afdankede pornostjerner, et barskt familiedrama og en hjertevarm hyggeversion af 'The Devil Wears Prada'. 'Promising Young Woman' Carey Mulligan tager sagen i egen hånd i 'Promising Young Woman' Foto: Focus Features Før kvinden bag 'Saltburn' fik os alle til at gå i kollektiv sexpsykose, mens vi kronisk havde 00'er-popsangen 'Murder on the Dancefloor' på hjernen og ikke rigtig kunne slette synet af en nøgen, dansende Barry Keoghan fra nethinden, var der 'Promising Young Woman'. Emerald Fennells fuldstændig forrygende, tankevækkende og ekstremt underholdende spillefilmsdebut, der sikrede hende en Oscar for bedste originale manuskript. Filmen har et guddommeligt soundtrack og handler om kvinden Cassie (Carey Mulligan), der forgæves forsøger at holde sit liv ud, efter at hendes bedste veninde går bort. Cassie får nu sine lange, ensomme nætter til at gå med at lege en form for sexet, kvindelig Batman-selvtægtshelt, der gør gaderne usikre for klamme mænd, der vil udnytte stangstive kvinder. Hun har et kynisk syn på hankøn og tror altid det værste. Cassie er derfor meget skeptisk, da kærligheden rammer hende i skikkelse af den vidunderlige børnelæge Ryan, spillet af klassekomikeren Bo Burnham. 'Red Rocket' 'Red Rocket' Foto: A24 Sean Baker, manden bag årets helt store Oscar-succes, 'Anora', er afgjort en af de mest interessante amerikanske instruktører pt. Han slog filmkarrieren an med 'Tangerine' og 'The Florida Project' og har siden vendt sit følsomme, forstående og imødekommende blik mod pornoindustrien og sexarbejde i 'Red Rocket'. Det er en morsom, men også socialrealistisk komedie, der handler om en falleret pornostjerne, der vender tilbage til sin hjemby i Texas. Hans navn er Mikey ""Saber"" Davies og spilles af 'Scary Movie'-stjernen Simon Rex. Mikey kan ikke finde sig til rette i hjembyen, der synes klaustrofobisk lille for ham. Mens han laver fejl på stribe, forsøger han at genopfinde sig selv og planlægger et storslået, sexet comeback til pornoscenen i Hollywood. 'Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris' En fornem greve (Lambert Wilson) og Mrs. Harris (Lesley Manville) deltager i et Dior-show i 'Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris' Foto: Dávid Lukács / Focus Features Hvis 'The Devil Wears Prada' og 'Phantom Thread' fik et feelgood-filmbarn, ville det være 'Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris'. Den charmerende, historiske komedie handler om en enke, der pludselig kommer til penge. Hun har altid sørget for andre, men på sine ældre dage indser rengøringskonen Ada Harris (Lesley Manville), at hun faktisk også selv fortjener lidt forkælelse. I et vildt forsøg på at finde sin drømmekjole fra Dior rejser hun derfor til Paris. Her kunne man forestille sig, at eventyret endte brat og hurtigt udviklede sig til den ubehøvlede sekvens i 'Pretty Woman', hvor den prostituerede Vivian fornærmes af snobbede butiksassistenter. Men i den her magiske, britiske fortælling er det modsatte tilfældet – og snart kommer Ada Harris på sit livs eventyr.

Den onde skurk, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), er derimod en ubarmhjertig og hensynsløs lejemorder, der dræber uden at tøve. Og til sidst er der den grimme Tuco (Eli Wallach), som er en snu forbryder, der på listig vis altid undgår straf og snor sig ud af selv de mest håbløse situationer med skindet i behold.

'Stegte grønne tomater' Mary Stuart Masterson som Idgie Threadgoode og Mary-Louise Parker som Ruth Jamison i 'Stegte grønne tomater' Foto: Universal Studios Den ikoniske, feministiske film 'Stegte grønne tomater' blev nomineret til to Oscars for bedste kvindelige birolle (Tandy) og bedste manuskript – og efter et gensyn med Jon Avnets fantastiske, rolige adaptation kan man godt forstå hvorfor. Filmen har Kathy Bates og Jessica Tandy i rollerne som to kvinder, der gennem fortællingen om en vild livshistorie kommer tættere på hinanden. Det sker, da den undertrykte husmor Evelyn (Bates) møder den ældre kvinde Ninny Threadgoode (Tandy) på et plejehjem....","SPR_COMBO[da]Vi er gået i DRTV's blandselv-afdeling og har sammensat den mest forrygende pose blandede bolsjer til dig. Der er lidt af hvert – lige fra hylende morsomt feministisk hævntogt til en ikonisk western, afdankede pornostjerner, et barskt familiedrama og en hjertevarm hyggeversion af 'The Devil Wears Prada'. 'Promising Young Woman' Carey Mulligan tager sagen i egen hånd i 'Promising Young Woman' Foto: Focus Features Før kvinden bag 'Saltburn' fik os alle til at gå i kollektiv sexpsykose, mens vi kronisk havde 00'er-popsangen 'Murder on the Dancefloor' på hjernen og ikke rigtig kunne slette synet af en nøgen, dansende Barry Keoghan fra nethinden, var der 'Promising Young Woman'. Emerald Fennells fuldstændig forrygende, tankevækkende og ekstremt underholdende spillefilmsdebut, der sikrede hende en Oscar for bedste originale manuskript. Filmen har et guddommeligt soundtrack og handler om kvinden Cassie (Carey Mulligan), der forgæves forsøger at holde sit liv ud, efter at hendes bedste veninde går bort. Cassie får nu sine lange, ensomme nætter til at gå med at lege en form for sexet, kvindelig Batman-selvtægtshelt, der gør gaderne usikre for klamme mænd, der vil udnytte stangstive kvinder. Hun har et kynisk syn på hankøn og tror altid det værste. Cassie er derfor meget skeptisk, da kærligheden rammer hende i skikkelse af den vidunderlige børnelæge Ryan, spillet af klassekomikeren Bo Burnham. 'Red Rocket' 'Red Rocket' Foto: A24 Sean Baker, manden bag årets helt store Oscar-succes, 'Anora', er afgjort en af de mest interessante amerikanske instruktører pt. Han slog filmkarrieren an med 'Tangerine' og 'The Florida Project' og har siden vendt sit følsomme, forstående og imødekommende blik mod pornoindustrien og sexarbejde i 'Red Rocket'. Det er en morsom, men også socialrealistisk komedie, der handler om en falleret pornostjerne, der vender tilbage til sin hjemby i Texas.

That said, I'd rather have healthy skin, and the weather in my region is extremely hot in the summer and very cold in the winter) * I will be using that one product all over my face thinly for when I have events and such, but I only do that when there is something going on which is maximum 12 times a year and maybe even less. * Is actually worth the money (no fading, caking, or separating) **Budget for makeup:** I'd rather avoid expensive products that break the bank, but I'm willing to spend if it's something I'll truly use and not regret buying.

UgxHBWDe6zUAR4PAeQ14AaABAg,"  Aloha gorgeous, Wow, that Guerlain palette was made for you! So gorgeous, and I think you could wear it year round. For the Guerlain powder, I like the translucent all over, but more so for under the eyes, and any where I need brightening. It has a slight pink tint to it. The Medium powder I like all over, not under my eyes. It's a bit too dark under the eyes for me. I also love the medium shade if my foundation looks a bit too light, and it's gorgeous over a tinted SPF too. The powder is amazing, I agree with the container being a bit too big. I wish they would have included a smaller container to decant for travel. That would be great, especially for the price. I have to try a Guerlain blush, I'm having a hard time picking out a shade.I don't have a store nearby where I can swatch. Our Nordstrom is far, and they seem to not have much selection of Guerlain even on line. I'm not sure what's going on. My new obsession is the Prada eye shadows. I have 3 palettes, and I love them so much. Along with the Dior Cannage LE palettes. Have you tried the Dior Cannage yet? I think you would love Brown Cashmere. It's so gorgeous!! The formula is comparable to the Prada. I want to try the Guerlain shadows, but I haven't found a color story that resonates yet. Lately I've been into the smaller palettes versus large palettes. Just easier to put a look together when you're short on time. Thank you for your video, hope you're all enjoying the Summer! Xoxo PS. I love the Guerlain concealer it's lovely for the summer. I wish it came in a plastic container versus the glass, and the wand was easier to get out. I dropped mine on my tile floor, and it shattered. I order another one. What do you think about the Gucci concealer? I would like to try it, but can't figure out what shade.","Aloha gorgeous, Wow, that Guerlain palette was made for you!

Minis and maxis receive abundant fanfare, but the trusty midi is relatively uncelebrated, doing the hard work of clothing us for summer weddings and work events and everything in-between. Well, until now. This season, the midi dress finally found its way out of everyday rotation and onto the SS25 catwalks, where designers celebrated the calf-grazing style in multiple guises. The summer midi dress – be it figure-skimming and polka dotted or oversized and airy – is finally being given the attention it deserves. Consider a summer dress with an interesting neckline, namely something strapless or asymmetric. Specifically, we can't stop thinking about Versace's slinky, floral bandeau dress, which was styled with metallic chartreuse sling-backs and a mini bag (hello again, Y2K) on the runway. Meanwhile, Dior, Bottega Veneta and Jacquemus all made a case for the one-shoulder LBD. Read Next Speaking of LBDs, there were plenty more – but not as you know them. Enter the Loose Black Dress – a billowing, much more comfortable alternative to its comparatively littler counterpart. See Simone Rocha and Tibi's offerings (which have pockets!) or Khaite's cut-out tunic dress, offering a glimpse of body beneath the swathes of fabric. On and off the runway, the polka-dot dress occupies a prize spot (pun intended). Notable mentions go to the 1990s-inspired, tomato-red, halterneck midi Kaia Gerber wore to the Tribeca Film Festival last month, and the wispy spot-print slip from Charles Jeffrey Loverboy's SS25 collection. A satin slip is also a fine idea, as advocated by Alexa Chung, Dries Van Noten, and an abundance of editors at fashion week. When it comes to summer midi dresses, the choices are plenty. Luckily, we've narrowed it down for you with our curated edit.

A Loose Black Midi Summer Dress Cos Bubble-Hem Midi Dress Arket Ballon-Sleeve Dress Rise & Fall Women's Silk Organza Layered Dress When temperatures soar, all we really want to wear is a tent dress – luckily for us, they are abundant for SS25.

mov_AE68DC4D03200A163F33590A8D76A3BC,"  The global personal luxury goods market, valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.24%. The U.S.-China trade war poses challenges, impacting costs and availability. Key trends include circular economy initiatives, online retail strategies, and urban demand in emerging markets. Segment growth varies, with watches and jewelry leading, while beauty and fragrances witness fastest growth. APAC remains the dominant region, driven by urbanization and digital retail transformation. Major players like LVMH and Rolex leverage strategic partnerships and innovation to maintain market positioning. Personal Luxury Goods Market Dublin, July 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Personal Luxury Goods Market Research Report 2025-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Personal Luxury Goods Market was valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.24%. The global personal luxury goods market is fragmented and characterized by numerous manufacturers that hold modest market share. Key players, including LVH, Prada Group, Rolex, Kering, and Richemont, among others, have established dominance in the market by continuously innovating and expanding their product offerings. Major vendors are strategically implementing innovative technologies to maintain their market positions. For instance, in 2023, Burberry introduced its virtual store by partnering with Blankos Block Party, a gaming platform, and offering interactive product discovery. The companies in the personal luxury goods industry are also focusing on several strategic partnerships with other providers to ensure continuous supply chains and manufacturing capabilities. For instance, in 2023, Kering completed a 30% acquisition of the Italian luxury fashion house Valentino. The partnership is between Valentino's parent company, Mayhoola, and it has also provided an option for Kering to acquire the remaining 70% by 2028. The leaders in the personal luxury goods market are making significant R&D investments to enhance the availability and differentiation of their products. For instance, in 2024, Richemont acquired Vhernier, which is an Italian jewelry brand, to enhance its Jewelry Maisons division. Furthermore, companies are increasingly expanding their product range and strengthening their market positions through acquisitions and partnerships. For instance, in 2024, Lavie Luxe launched its new 18% fragrance concentration perfume line, featuring four Eau de Parfum fragrances named LUSH, LILY, LAGOON, and LOVE. Consumers are increasingly interested in luxury goods that are designed with circular economic principles, such as those that can be easily upcycled. Gucci was the first luxury brand to use ECONYL recycled nylon in ready-wear pieces, which is a 100% recycled nylon derived from fishing nets, textile waste, and a thick pile fabric used for carpets and upholstery. Luxury brands have increasingly adopted online approaches to meet evolving consumer expectations. For instance, in 2023, Dior was the most popular luxury brand online because of its strategic investments in digital marketing, e-commerce, and social media engagement. This approach helped the brand to engage a wider audience, which has boosted its online sales, especially in markets like China and the US. Brands strategically position themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops in places like Bali and Phuket. It has created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. Hence, such factors are supporting the demand for the personal luxury goods market across emerging nations. As the global economies continue to grow, disposable income levels rise, leading to increased spending on luxury items like footwear. Consumers are increasingly inclined towards luxury footwear because of changing lifestyles and fashion trends. Luxury footwear companies are focusing on the growing consumer base in developing countries such as India and other Southeast Asian countries, where wealth and demand for luxury goods are rising. In 2022, Louis Vuitton introduced its exclusive footwear collection for the Indian market, which features new colors like Rani Pink and glittering designs for celebrating India's cultural heritage. Urbanization in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia continues to drive demand for the personal luxury goods market. In India, platforms like Luxepolis have significantly supported the development of the market by offering new and pre-owned luxury items to a growing audience in smaller cities, as the growing urban population increases the demand for high-end items. Brands are strategically positioning themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops to places like Bali and Phuket. Additionally, collaborations between fashion houses and hospitality venues such as Fendi's beach club in Marbella have created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS The disruption in the supply chain has led to increased costs for raw materials, logistics, and transportation, which have raised operational costs and are often passed on to end consumers which leading to higher luxury goods prices. The focus on limited production to maintain exclusivity significantly raises the production costs for luxury brands. Brands often face higher unit costs for manufacturing, sourcing premium materials, and utilizing skilled labor for producing limited edition items. This limits scalability and hampers the personal luxury goods market demand. Furthermore, major brands occasionally face backlash for products or marketing campaigns, such as Louis Vuitton for selling a scarf inspired by the Palestinian keffiyeh and a jacket that seems to present Jamaican culture by using the country's flags but incorrectly represented. These factors hamper the brand value and show the need for careful consideration in global marketing efforts. PERSONAL LUXURY GOODS MARKET GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS The APAC region dominated the global personal luxury goods market, accounting for a share of over 38% in 2024. APAC is experiencing a surge in urbanization and rising disposable income, particularly in countries like China, India, and Southeast Asian countries. A growing middle and upper-middle class is driving demand for luxury goods as markers of status, success, and aspiration.

I'll keep you posted ☺️. I haven't tried the Dior one but I keep thinking I need to order it, everyone loves it. Maybe I'll see if it's still available today maybe even look for a 4th of July sale or something 😁. Oh I LOVE the Gucci concealer. It's so nice.

mov_0F616B39CDCF16B93AE3EDD8AD4F4C1C,"  An everyday lipstick, like any other part of a makeup or beauty routine, is inherently personal and varies from person to person. I've gone through practically every phase imaginable. At one point, a bright cherry red was my go-to. At another, I wanted a nude lipstick so subtle I could barely tell it apart from my natural lip color—the versatility is part of what makes playing with makeup so fun. Still, there are a few boxes that your go-to formula should easily check. “A great everyday lipstick is all about balance,” says celebrity makeup artist Ash K. Holm. “It should be comfortable, long-wearing, and easy to apply without a mirror.” Holm adds that a formula that hydrates the lips is ideal, but it also needs enough pigment to pull a look together. On top of that, it should fade evenly—no harsh lines as it wears off throughout the day. Sounds like a tall order? It is, but that's where I come in. Next to blush, lipstick is one of my absolute favorite makeup categories to test, and I've come across quite a few that can satisfy even the pickiest beauty lover. Keep reading to find the everyday lipstick that deserves a spot in your collection. The Best Everyday Lipsticks Best Everyday Lipstick Overall MAC Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick in Thanks, It's Mac! MAC's Lustreglass Lipstick, specifically in the shade Thanks It's MAC, is the closest thing to a truly universal lipstick that I have ever found. It's a taupey pink with a silver pearl, but don't let that scare you—the shimmer is virtually nonexistent in this formula once you swipe it onto your lips. One of my favorite things about this shade is that it can be worn with or without a lip liner, and it layers beautifully. Finish: Glossy Key Ingredients: Castor seed oil, shea butter, squalane (moisturizing) What I Love: Looks good on the majority of skin tones; Sleek packaging; Barely-there scent What I Don't: Due to the emollience of the formula, it wears off quickly Review for MC: “This is one of my favorite lipsticks of all time, and for good reason. It's a neutral-toned taupe pink color that doesn't veer too cool or warm, making it perfectly suitable for a variety of skin tones. It also layers beautifully with other lipstick formulas in my collection, acting almost like a traditional gloss by depositing color without taking over the entire look.” — Ariel Baker, Beauty Writer Ariel Baker testing MAC Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick in Thanks, Its Mac! (Image credit: Ariel Baker) Best Everyday Neutral Lipstick NYX Smushy Matte Lip Balm in Soft Smile This is a newer formula to my makeup routine, but I'm so glad I came across it. The Smush Matte Lip Balms sound a little confusing (mainly because I've never used a lip balm that's actually matte before), but once I applied it, I saw the magic in the formula. I'd consider this more of a blurring lipstick, similar to soft-focus formulas popular in the K-Beauty space. The shade Soft Smile, a brown nude, is the closest I've gotten to a true skin-toned match on myself in a long time, but it also works nicely as a neutral across a majority of skin tones. And as the brand claims, it really does blur the lines in my lips, creating a gorgeous, soft-matte canvas. Finish: Matte Key Ingredients: Dimethicone (silicone base that smooths lines); Ceramide np (improves skin barrier function); Shea butter (moisturizes) What I Love: 12 shades; Most affordable lipstick on this list What I Don't: Strong caramel scent that lingers for a bit before fading, which is a personal preference Review for MC: “This is such a fun lipstick to keep in my purse. Not only is it super compact, but the formula feels almost like a traditional silicone primer on my lips, and just like those formulas, it blurs the lines and imperfections on the area while depositing color—a win-win if you ask me. While it has a strong scent, I'm completely willing to overlook it not only for the unique formula but also the gorgeous nude shade that is Soft Smile, which complements my skin tone perfectly.” — Ariel Baker, Beauty Writer Ariel Baker testing NYX Smushy Matte Lip Balm in Soft Smile.

A longtime collaborator of Dior's, the Mumbai-based studio is renowned for its work in preserving and teaching an array of craft techniques, as well as creating immersive installations based on artworks. Nearly three decades ago, Chanakya's artistic director, Karishma Swali, first connected with designer Maria Grazia Chiuri and has since worked with her artisans to create immersive textiles for the brand's fashion shows, replicating and accompanying art by Judy Chicago, Faith Ringgold, Isabella Ducrot, and more. Earlier this year for Dior's Spring/Summer 2025 haute couture collection, Chanakya and graduates from its nonprofit, Chanakya School of Craft, created a backdrop of large-scale textile panels titled “The Flowers We Grew,” imagined by artist Rithika Merchant. The show's interior atmosphere was enlivened by nine large-scale panels that hung from the walls, each representing Indian heritage and values special to Merchant. Mimicking the brushstrokes and chemical composition of the watercolor paintings, the hand-embroidered collaboration took 306 artisans 144,000 hours to execute.

mov_CFEC879562AF3234331D44567D96AA6F,"  Evita, Palladium review and star rating: ★★★ Whole PHDs could be written about the publicity campaign for Jamie Lloyd's Evita. Hundreds of people are gathering outside the Palladium every night to watch Rachel Zegler belt 'Don't Cry for me Argentina' from the theatre balcony for free, a fun PR stunt that is getting so popular it risks being shut down by the police, while the ticketholders, some paying upwards of £245 per seat, have to settle for watching the performance via video link. And on opening night, Keanu Reeves, Jessica Alba and Pedro Pascal were some of the A-Listers sat metres from me who gave multiple standing ovations in the first act – not at the end, but half an hour into the show. It's common to see British acting titans at West End opening nights, but this random collection of A-Listers who aren't particularly known for theatre showed how far beyond the West End landscape this production has travelled. How come? It's from Jamie Lloyd, the zeitgeisty producer behind 2023's Sunset Boulevard, the man who is basically reinventing what West End shows can look like, so anything he does generates buzz. It also stars Rachel Zegler, who was most famously racially abused for playing Snow White. Lloyd uses live video effects and radical aesthetics (think the lighting and set design from a Wembley Arena pop show) to make the point that theatre can be bigger, louder and more ambitious. But where Sunset Boulevard was more of a gentle character study, Evita is primarily a series of phenomenal ensemble numbers. Ultimately it feels more like a music concert than conventional piece of theatrical storytelling. As for Zegler, with the straying of an eye or the tilt of her head, she finds depth in the Argentinian leader's story, finding warmth, confidence and vulnerability in the tragic figure. Evita is inspired by the real-life story of Eva Peron, a working class Argentinian who married leader Juan Peron and died of cervical cancer aged 33. She is viewed as a contradictory figure because she helped establish workers' rights and paid leave, and got women the vote, but also became an early Champagne socialist; for some, her love for Christian Dior dresses and the finer things in life felt at odds with her stance about equality. The show runs at three hours but feels half that because it is stuffed with utterly incredible choreography and the litany of musical numbers, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It's difficult to imagine that anything this stimulating has ever played in the West End before. And yet, I wasn't alone in finding Evita hard work. The outdated script introduces a range of historical characters without really putting them into context, or explaining their roles properly. The cast needs more space to tell the story with visual cues, but with barely any spoken lines – everything is delivered in verse as a rock opera – and a breakneck pace, the show is hard to follow for people who don't know the story well. I was relieved when, by the interval, multiple other journalists admitted to me they were finding the show hard to follow. It doesn't help that the production is also too loud, and when she sings Rachel Zegler's diction means she becomes difficult to understand. It's the same for the ensemble numbers: too often it's really difficult to catch what they're saying. It raises whole questions about accessibility, and the amount of knowledge audiences should come into shows with. Some critics will say cult musicals are designed for die-hard fans, but I tend to veer towards thinking shows should be able to be understood by newcomers. While this new production of Evita offers plenty of fresh thinking on the scope of the type of production values that are possible in these cranky, hundred-year-old theatres, I can't help but feel disappointed that so much of it went over my head. Evita plays at the London Palladium until September","Evita, Palladium review and star rating: ★★★ Whole PHDs could be written about the publicity campaign for Jamie Lloyd's Evita.

mov_BFDD0B5807872867C432C347807BBD27,"  SPR_COMBO[da]Tusinder af danskere har pakket kufferterne og er i weekenden draget sydpå til sol og varme. Mange flere vil følge efter i denne og næste uge, hvor den helt store charterferie uge indledes. De fleste tager den obligatoriske tur gennem lufthavnens taxfree butikker, for her er det jo billigt at købe en masse rare ting, som man kan forkæle sig selv eller andre med på ferien, eller nå.r man vender solbrændt hjem igen. Alene ordet ”taxfree” giver indtryk af, at varerne er billige at købe i lufthavnen – og danskerne har ” altid godt kunnet lide at spare penge. Københavns Lufthavn har lynende travlt her ved optakten til sommerferien. (Foto: Mads Aarmgaard / Københavns Lufthavn) De vil dog blive slemt skuffede, viser en ny analyse, som pris-sammenlignings-siden Pricerunner har foretaget i Københavns Lufthavn. Pricerunner har kigget på 20 populære varer og sammenlignet deres priser i lufthavnens taxfree med, hvad man kan købe dem for ude i det ”almindelige” Danmark. Analysen afslører, at 18 af de 20 varer er dyrere i lufthavnen. Køber man dem alle sammen, er prisen 1.488 kroner højere i lufthavnens taxfree. Ifølge Pricerunner kostede de 20 produkter i gennemsnit næsten 20 procent mindre uden for lufthavnen end inde i dens toldfri område. Solcreme er uundværlig for de fleste, når de tager på sommerferie nu. Tjek dog lige prisen i og uden for lufthavnen. (Foto: Natalia Blauth / Unsplash+) ”Mange af os griber automatisk ud efter taxfree varer i lufthavnen, fordi vi tænker, at de da er billigere. Det er helt forkert,” siger Brian Kjer Sommer. Han er forbruger analytiker hos Pricerunner. Sandheden er en helt anden, og hvis man kigger sig om efter de samme varer ude i butikkerne i Danmark kan man få dem langt billigere,” fortsætter han. En af de helt klassiske varer i rejsetasken er chokolade, og her er en 100 grams Toblerone næsten dobbelt så dyr i lufthavnens taxfree som hos den billigste forhandler uden for. De trendy LEGO blomster butikker som f.eks. LEGO Botanicals Mini-orkidé 10343 koster tilsvarende 34 procent mere i taxfree. Her er prisen 229 kroner, mens buketten kan fås for 170 kroner hos en forhandler ude i Danmark. Denne slags butikker ser man mange af i lufthavne. (Foto: Pexels / Pixabay) Make-up og parfume er traditionelt også meget populære som taxfree. Det kan man tydeligt se, fordi de er placeret længst fremme og ved indgangen i lufthavnens store supermarkeder. Tager vi f.eks. den velkendte herreduft Emporio Armani Stronger with You EdP 50 ml, skal man betale 649 kroner for den lille flaske i Københavns Lufthavns taxfree. Uden for lufthavnen kan den købes 172 kroner billigere. Her i sommer er solcreme naturligvis uundværlig, men køb den hellere, inden I tager i lufthavnen. Her er bl.a. Biotherm Lait Solaire Hydratsant SPF50 i 400 ml beholder 20,7 procent dyrere. ”Det er velkendt, at priser kan være højere på de mest besøgte ferie-destinationer. Færre er nok klar over, at taxfree på vej til rejsemålet også er meget dyrere,” forklarer Brian Kjer Sommer Toblerone chokolade hører til storsællerterne i lufthavnes taxfree, selvom det sjældent kan betale sig at købe dem dér. (Foto: Hans / Pixabay) ”Hvis man i forvejen ved, hvad man gerne vil købe på sin ferie, er det klogt at sammenligne priserne med de danske, inden man tager afsted,” fortsætter han. Kun to af de 20 varer, som Pricerunner tjekkede priserne på, var billigere i taxfree shoppen i Københavns Lufthavn. Det var en bøtte med 295 gram Lakrids by Bülw A The Original, som man kan spare en enkelt krone på. Bedre var det med Diors Addict Lip Tint No. 542 Natural Sienna lipgloss. Her var prisen 40 kroner lavere i Danmarks største lufthavn…. (Indledningsfoto til artiklen:  / Unsplash+) Her er den komplette liste over de pristjekkede varer.

mov_150F23C7BE9A090914854CCA8F191542,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Ein Sommerduft muss nicht aufdringlich sein, er sollte eine gewisse Frische ausstrahlen, verspielt-ozeanisch sein und zugleich mysteriös und aufregend wirken. Suchst du aktuell nach einer Duftkomposition, die dich an einen Ort der Erholung und der Sinnlichkeit entführt? Dann haben wir genau das Richtige für dich. Wir verraten dir, welche sechs Sommerdüfte aktuell beliebt sind und sich auf jeder Wunschliste wiederfinden sollten. #1 „Nivea Creme“ von Nivea Mit dem Duft „Nivea Creme“ gibt es die klassische und beliebte Nivea Creme auch als Eau de Toilette. Der Duft wurde erstmals im Jahr 2011 lanciert und ist seither unverändert geblieben. Sein frischer Zitrusduft und seine sanften Lavendelnoten verleihen ihm eine unverkennbare Frische. Darüber hinaus betört das Parfum mit einer erhabenen Präsenz – damit wird der Unisex-Duft dem Hype gerecht und ist eines unserer Sommer-Staples. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #2 „Nivea Sun“ von Nivea Suchst du einen leichten und angenehmen Unisex-Duft für die warmen Sommertage, ist „Nivea Sun“ von Nivea dein Duft. Das trendy Eau de Toilette bietet ein erfrischendes Dufterlebnis, das an warme Sommertage am Meer erinnert. Sinnlich und aufregend gehalten, verschmilzt der Zitrus-Cocktail mit einem Bouquet aus Blumen sowie mit würzig holzigen Akkorden, welche ein sensuelles und verführerisches Gefühl erwecken. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #3 „Boss The Scent“ von Hugo Boss „Boss The Scent“ von Hugo Boss ist ein Parfum für die facettenreiche Frau. Der im Jahr 2016 lancierte Duft ist das Gegenstück zum gleichnamigen Herrenparfum und seither für seine sinnliche und verführerische Wirkung beliebt. Raffiniert und feminin in seiner Komposition, ist er eine Hommage an die selbstsichere und elegante Frau und vereint geschickt saftigen Pfirsich mit blumiger Osmanthusblüte. Abschließend bildet sinnlicher, weißer Moschus eine subtile, aber hinreißende Duftnuance, welche das Eau de Parfum zu einem Must-have der Saison macht. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. Schönheitsideale im Wandel der Zeit Schönheitsideale im Wandel der Zeit #4 „The One“ von Calvin Klein Der Duft „The One“ von Calvin Klein ist ein aromatisch-zitrischer und frischer Unisex-Duft für den Sommer. Das Eau de Toilette entzückt mit einer sauberen Komposition aus frischem, grünen Tee sowie floralen Rosen und Veilchen und rundet das Dufterlebnis mit einem sanften Abschluss aus sinnlichem Moschus und holzig verführerischer Ambra ab. Unaufdringlich und perfekt für den Alltag! Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #5 „Hypnotic Poison“ von Christian Dior Für alle, die im Sommer intensivere Düfte bevorzugen, ist „Hypnotic Poison“ von Christian Dior die perfekte Wahl. In der Kopfnote sorgt der orientalische Duft für einen frischen und saftig-pflaumigen Auftakt, während sich im Herzen ein florales Zusammenspiel aus Jasmin- und Rosenakkorden entfaltet. Die Basisnote umhüllt dich schließlich in eine sanft betörende und würzige Wolke aus Moschus, Sandelholz und Vanille – so kennen und lieben wir den traumhaft, verführerischen Signatur-Duft von Dior. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #6 „Light Blue“ von Dolce & Gabbana Unser last but not the least: „Light Blue“ von Dolce & Gabbana ist eine moderne Interpretation des klassischen Zitronenduftes. Das Eau de Toilette entführt dich an das belebende Mittelmeer und entfaltet ein leichtes und entspanntes Lebensgefühl. Dabei vereint es einen spannenden Cocktail aus fruchtigen, zitrischen und holzig-pudrigen Duftakkorden, welche den Duft der mediterranen Amalfiküste einfangen. Der elegante Flakon rundet das Erlebnis ab. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. Lust auf sinnlich florale Düfte bekommen? Florale Parfums verströmen einen Hauch von Sinnlichkeit und Verspieltheit, welche mehr Romantik und Leichtigkeit im Alltag hervorbringen. Wir verraten dir, um welche sieben trendy Düfte echte Pfingstrosen-Liebhaber*innen diese Saison nicht herumkommen.","SPR_COMBO[de]Ein Sommerduft muss nicht aufdringlich sein, er sollte eine gewisse Frische ausstrahlen, verspielt-ozeanisch sein und zugleich mysteriös und aufregend wirken.

mov_288F8824BE84655A34B1E28FF396C022,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Rihanna proudly displayed her bare baby bump on Wednesday, as she arrived at the Royal Monceau Hotel in Paris with her youngest son Riot by her side. The music superstar, 37, is currently pregnant with her third child with rapper boyfriend A$AP Rocky, with the couple already parents to sons RZA, three, and Riot, 23 months. She announced her exciting baby news in typically dramatic form, revealing her blossoming bump at May's Met Gala, where A$AP served one of the co-chairs. This week saw Rihanna enjoying a rare public outing with little Riot in the French capital, before the mother-and-son duo returned to their hotel. The hitmaker bared her growing bump in a cropped polo shirt teamed with a pair of very oversized cargo pants, and ballerina flats. While she toted the newly redesigned Book Tote from Dior, based on the first edition cover of Dracula by Bram Stoker. Doting on her youngest child, Rihanna beamed as she held tightly onto Riot's hand, while the adorable tot didn't hide his annoyance at the surrounding cameras. Her latest outing comes just days after boyfriend A$AP appeared to accidentally let slip the gender of their unborn child. The rapper was asked if the couple were set to have daughter after previously welcoming two boys, while attending the world premiere of Rihanna's new film, Smurfs, in Brussels on Sunday. On the blue carpet, Entertainment Tonight asked: 'Is that the girl you've been waiting for', A$AP immediately confirming: 'It is, man, it is.' The Everyday chart-topper - whose real name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers - then held up a plush Smurfette doll and added: 'Right here, you know what I'm saying? Right here.' But in response to the same question, Rihanna merely smiled coyly and replied: 'Let's see if it's a Smurfette...It could be a Papa Smurf. Who knows?' However, the singer did confirm that the couple would give their next child a name that begins with R, like their first two, adding: 'That's the one thing me and Rocky don't fight over.' When asked how many more children they planned on having, A$AP joked: 'We [are] going to be like the Wayans' family, you know? Yeah, I mean, love is beautiful and it's just [about] spreading it.' The power couple - who share matching 1988 tattoos to mark their birth year - originally met in 2011 when Rihanna first enlisted A$AP to rap on her song Cockiness (Love It). While they were romantically linked in 2013, after he after opened up for her Diamonds World Tour, they first confirmed their relationship in May 2021, when A$AP told GQ Rihanna was 'the love of my life'. Rihanna both produced and starred in Paramount Animation's Smurfs, playing the voice role of Smurfette - along with writing and recording original songs like Friend Of Mine. Smurfette was previously voiced by the billionaire's rival pop stars Katy Perry and Demi Lovato. Chris Miller's animated film will also feature Nick Offerman, Natasha Lyonne, JP Karliak, Dan Levy, Amy Sedaris, Nick Kroll, James Corden, Octavia Spencer, Hannah Waddingham, Sandra Oh, Alex Winter, Billie Lourd, Xolo Maridueña, Kurt Russell, and John Goodman. A$AP also took on an acting role as Yung Felony in Spike Lee's critically-acclaimed neo-noir crime thriller Highest 2 Lowest, which hits US theaters August 22 before streaming on Apple TV+ starting September 5. But there is still no release date for the New York native's long-delayed fourth studio album, Don't Be Dumb.","Have YOU got a story?

mov_0E38685FDFA51F6B7EF2BBA08A8C5A74,"  Paris Men's Fashion Week 2025 arrived with a quiet confidence. This summer season is defined less by spectacle and more by nuance. From Pharrell's global diplomacy at Louis Vuitton to Jonathan Anderson's subtle reimagining of Dior heritage, the collections echoed a world in motion yet craving calm. Craftsmanship met technology, tradition bowed to innovation, and desire found expression in restraint. This was a moment of elegance and thoughtful reinvention — the kind of fashion that invites reflection and adventure. Here's KHAMSA's roundup of the names that shaped the week. ١. LOUIS VUITTON – Le Monde est à Vous [embedded content] For his third collection at Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams staged a show on the rooftop of UNESCO in Paris, where diplomacy met design. A Damier-printed runway designed in collaboration with Bijoy Jain of Studio Mumbai. The collaboration set the tone for a cross-cultural vision that paid tribute to India's dress codes and craftsmanship. Dubbed “Le Monde est à Vous” (The World is Yours), the collection fused tailored safari silhouettes, cricket jerseys, and a new “damoflage” print in a palette of earthy saffron, khaki, and ivory. Embellished trunks, turbans, and luxe monogrammed cargos signaled a shift toward ornate utility. With live music by AR Rahman and Native Voices of Resistance, the show underscored Vuitton's message: global elegance grounded in heritage, movement, and meaning. ٢. DIOR – Jonathan Anderson's Debut Courtesy of Dior Courtesy of Dior Courtesy of Dior At the Hôtel des Invalides, Dior marked a new chapter as Jonathan Anderson unveiled his first menswear collection for the house. The designer, known for his sculptural work at JW Anderson and Loewe, brought a fresh irreverence to Dior's legacy, stripping back the theatricality of past seasons. Silhouettes nodded to the maison's archives — most notably the Bar jacket, here oversized and re-gendered — while loose cargo pants echoed couture gowns from the 1940s. The collection's quiet provocation lay in its restraint: historical references warped into modern utility, florals stitched as whispers, and tailoring that blurred between dressing up and dressing down. Set within a space modeled on Berlin's Gemäldegalerie, Anderson's debut redefined heritage as a structure to twist, not preserve. ٣. HERMÈS – Summer in the City Courtesy of Hermès Courtesy of Hermès At Hermès, Véronique Nichanian offered a study in air, light, and ease. The collection unfolded like a deep breath — technical yet sensual, refined yet grounded. Openwork leather traced clean lines across blousons and trousers, while a muted palette of putty, caramel, and mint gave way to richer tones like burgundy and vanilla. Shapes were fluid but never loose: shirt-jackets, cropped trousers, and soft parkas constructed with the precision of saddlery, but made to move. There was no spectacle here — only the subtle poetry of craftsmanship. This was summer not as a season, but as a texture: breathable, tactile, and wholly at peace with itself. Courtesy of Hermès ٤. SAINT LAURENT – Clinamen Courtesy of Saint Laurent Courtesy of Saint Laurent Courtesy of Saint Laurent Anthony Vaccarello's latest menswear show unfolded under dry afternoon light at the Bourse de Commerce, where stillness replaced spectacle. Inspired by a generation of artists who turned desire into form — and by Yves Saint Laurent's own 1974 retreat — the collection explored elegance through restraint. Waists were cinched, shoulders extended, and fabrics like silk and nylon floated close to the body without clinging. The palette, hushed and coastal, echoed sand, salt, and pale ochre. At the center of the space, porcelain bowls drifted in a circular basin — the Clinamen installation by Céleste Boursier-Mougenot — producing quiet collisions that mirrored the show's mood. There were no grand gestures, only presence, held with intent. Courtesy of Saint Laurent ٥. KENZO – Club Kenzo...","Paris Men's Fashion Week 2025 arrived with a quiet confidence.

mov_40D9ED93ACFBB2479F426AE4E07D0E73,"  It's rare for a West End theatre production to garner so much attention and excitement before opening night, yet that is exactly what Rachel Zegler has managed to do as she steps into the shoes of Eva Perón in director Jamie Lloyd's daring take on the beloved musical, Evita. Over the last two weeks of preview shows, Zegler has stepped out on to the balcony of The London Palladium, the musical's new home, mid-performance to perform a powerful rendition of 'Don't Cry For Me, Argentina'. ' I don't think any of us expected it to garner as much attention as it did,' the 24-year-old actor reflects to ELLE UK, the morning after Evita's opening night. 'People have been camping out for hours before I go on and it's humbling, beautiful and fits in the story very well.' Starring as Perón, Zegler has received rave reviews for her passionate, high-voltage performance which follows the life of the Argentine political leader Juan Perón, and his second wife. The dynamic show, set to Andrew Lloyd Webber's soaring score, dominated social media during its preview period and has now officially opened its doors to London audiences. Pedro Pascal, Sarah Paulson and Keanu Reeves were among the high-profile guests at the Palladium on opening night to see Zegler belt out beloved ballads like 'Rainbow High' and 'A New Argentina'. 'Sarah texted me last week asking for the link to get tickets. I had no idea she meant last night,' Zegler exclaims. ' Then, our ensemble member Harrison Wilde asked me backstage, ""Rachel, is Pedro here? "" and I said he probably would have told me. Then, during 'Rainbow High', I saw Pedro stand up. I was like, ""Dad, you're embarrassing me! ""' she jokes. ' No, he was so sweet. Keanu Reeves was there, too. I was freaking out!' For the occasion, Zegler wore a SS25 beige tulle Haute Couture Dior ballgown adorned with bejewelled bows, designed by the house's recently departed creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri. On her look, Zegler worked closely with her long-time stylist Sarah Tooley to pay a visual tribute to her character's legacy. ' It was so evident to Sarah and I that Dior had to be a part of the night because of the lyrics of 'Rainbow High' being ""Christian Dior me from my head to my toes "",' she shares. 'Christian Dior was such an influence on Eva's fashion in real life, so we wanted to pay homage and have classic elements as well as the modern, diva and Madonna-esque version of Eva. That's why this design was so perfect.' Having worked with her since the start of Zegler's acting career, Tooley is a stylist she truly trusts. ' She knows my taste, but she also knows my body and what I'll feel comfortable in. That's a testament to the friendship and trust [we've] built,' Zegler reflects. Her look was finished with fine jewellery from London-based brands Ananya and David Morris, a fresh, glossy make-up look and her signature soft waves on the hair, styled by Valeria Ferreira and Dayaruci respectively. ' I want to look like myself as much as possible, so I can be myself in a professional sphere where a lot of pressure is on,' Zegler says of her glam approach. The opening night of Evita followed two weeks of preview shows, in which the production is tweaked nightly before it officially opens. ' That is both exhilarating and exhausting for an ensemble group of people, so it was such a wonderful experience to lock it and get the response we've had so far,' Zegler reflects. Still, one thing has remained consistent – the unprecedented reaction to the electric moment she leaves the stage and heads to the the theatre's balcony for the musical's most beloved number. 'It's brilliant,' Zegler says of the scene. ' The second Jamie said that's what he was trying to get permission from Westminster Council to do, I said ""We need to do anything to make that possibility real. "" But, as simple as it may seem, it's a huge production as there are a lot of technology and hard work involved to show the theatre inside the Palladium.' Zegler shares that audiences inside applaud nightly when they see the amount of people waiting outside as it's 'such a ridiculously impressive thing to pull off.' 'When we first performed it, it was just me in a robe and my wig to figure out the lighting and sound for the show. The odd person would stop and take a picture, but the next day, it was 100 people, then 20o and it would double in size. It's overwhelming but really moving.' As for the critics, Zegler states there's deeper meaning behind the spectacle. ' It's a testament to the fact that this show is based on history,' Zegler continues. ' Eva was a real person and there is no world in which she would want to impress people who could afford to see a show at a theatre. She wanted to bring her message to the streets and to the people. Jamie integrates the modern ingenuity of theatre by respecting the source material in such a way that serves such a beautiful purpose.' It's clear playing this role means a lot to Zegler. ' It's a dream come true. I haven't been on stage in a musical since high school [for Shrek The Musical, famously] and I missed it so much... When you get to live your dream, you don't take any second for granted and I'm not, I'm soaking in every second....","It's rare for a West End theatre production to garner so much attention and excitement before opening night, yet that is exactly what Rachel Zegler has managed to do as she steps into the shoes of Eva Perón in director Jamie Lloyd's daring take on the beloved musical, Evita. Over the last two weeks of preview shows, Zegler has stepped out on to the balcony of The London Palladium, the musical's new home, mid-performance to perform a powerful rendition of 'Don't Cry For Me, Argentina'. ' I don't think any of us expected it to garner as much attention as it did,' the 24-year-old actor reflects to ELLE UK, the morning after Evita's opening night. 'People have been camping out for hours before I go on and it's humbling, beautiful and fits in the story very well.' Starring as Perón, Zegler has received rave reviews for her passionate, high-voltage performance which follows the life of the Argentine political leader Juan Perón, and his second wife. The dynamic show, set to Andrew Lloyd Webber's soaring score, dominated social media during its preview period and has now officially opened its doors to London audiences. Pedro Pascal, Sarah Paulson and Keanu Reeves were among the high-profile guests at the Palladium on opening night to see Zegler belt out beloved ballads like 'Rainbow High' and 'A New Argentina'. 'Sarah texted me last week asking for the link to get tickets. I had no idea she meant last night,' Zegler exclaims. ' Then, our ensemble member Harrison Wilde asked me backstage, ""Rachel, is Pedro here? "" and I said he probably would have told me. Then, during 'Rainbow High', I saw Pedro stand up. I was like, ""Dad, you're embarrassing me! ""' she jokes. ' No, he was so sweet. Keanu Reeves was there, too. I was freaking out!' For the occasion, Zegler wore a SS25 beige tulle Haute Couture Dior ballgown adorned with bejewelled bows, designed by the house's recently departed creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri. On her look, Zegler worked closely with her long-time stylist Sarah Tooley to pay a visual tribute to her character's legacy. ' It was so evident to Sarah and I that Dior had to be a part of the night because of the lyrics of 'Rainbow High' being ""Christian Dior me from my head to my toes "",' she shares. 'Christian Dior was such an influence on Eva's fashion in real life, so we wanted to pay homage and have classic elements as well as the modern, diva and Madonna-esque version of Eva. That's why this design was so perfect.' Having worked with her since the start of Zegler's acting career, Tooley is a stylist she truly trusts. ' She knows my taste, but she also knows my body and what I'll feel comfortable in. That's a testament to the friendship and trust [we've] built,' Zegler reflects. Her look was finished with fine jewellery from London-based brands Ananya and David Morris, a fresh, glossy make-up look and her signature soft waves on the hair, styled by Valeria Ferreira and Dayaruci respectively. ' I want to look like myself as much as possible, so I can be myself in a professional sphere where a lot of pressure is on,' Zegler says of her glam approach. The opening night of Evita followed two weeks of preview shows, in which the production is tweaked nightly before it officially opens. ' That is both exhilarating and exhausting for an ensemble group of people, so it was such a wonderful experience to lock it and get the response we've had so far,' Zegler reflects. Still, one thing has remained consistent – the unprecedented reaction to the electric moment she leaves the stage and heads to the the theatre's balcony for the musical's most beloved number. 'It's brilliant,' Zegler says of the scene. ' The second Jamie said that's what he was trying to get permission from Westminster Council to do, I said ""We need to do anything to make that possibility real. "" But, as simple as it may seem, it's a huge production as there are a lot of technology and hard work involved to show the theatre inside the Palladium.'

mov_3E7B54EBFBCE404FE724C963D393B0EC,"  The Starboard Group is seizing the moment. With the cruise industry experiencing a sustained rebound post-COVID-19, the Starboard Group, operator of boutiques aboard cruise liners and super yachts, has been rolling out new product initiatives and services ranging from personalizing jewelry and ear piercings, to tequila developed with the Invicta Watch Group. More from WWD Starboard also plans to launch a natural diamond program this fall, details of which will be revealed later this summer. “Cruising has never been more popular,” said Caryl Capeci, Starboard's senior vice president of fine jewelry and Swiss watches. “There was a stoppage of the cruise ships during COVID-19, and then it all came back. We've seen not only the number of passengers but also retail sales on cruise ships grow and grow and grow. And in June, we had record high sales volume.” During an interview Tuesday, Capeci cited statistics indicating the cruise industry is forecast to carry 37 million passengers in 2025, up from approximately 34.6 million last year, with expectations to reach 42 million by 2028. So an opportunity to capture greater wallet share from more passengers on board cruise ships exists. Last year, Starboard cruise line shops generated an estimated $800 million to under $1 billion, according to sources. Capeci declined to confirm the figure though she characterized Starboard's 2024 volume as in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Starboard works with 14 cruise lines, including Royal Caribbean, Virgin Voyages and Carnival Cruise Line, and more than 95 different cruise ships selling everything from beauty, fragrance and liquor to apparel, Swiss watches and fine and fashion jewelry. Through its cruise and luxury division, Starboard operates single-brand shops, as well as multibrand shops on ships. Among the brand shops are Omega, Brietling, Tag Heuer, Bulgari, Hublot, Cartier, IWC, Panerai, Piaget, Messika, Swarovski and Pandora. Also sold are beauty brands such as Dior, Chanel, Lancome, Clinique, Estée Lauder, Clarins and La Mer. Shops range from 100 to 750 square feet. The merchandise in the Starboard shops is duty free and tax free. Among the initiatives Capeci cited: Boutiques for Cartier, IWC Schaffhausen and Piaget aboard Luminara, the newest super yacht in The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, which was launched this week. The boutiques offer Swiss timepieces, fine jewelry and accessories, as well as private viewings, in-suite appointments and sessions with brand ambassadors to explore the craftsmanship and heritage of the brands. Also on offer are designer jewelry, luxury accessories and resortwear — from vintage Hermès bags and Stella McCartney handbags to fine jewelry by Ileana Makri, Lauren Rubinski and Sydney Evan. Ear piercing in partnership with Inverness, the ear piercing system, has been set up on 33 ships across multiple cruise lines in the past couple of months. Starboard says “expertly trained retail team members” administer the piercings. The debut of Invicta Tequila is for sale exclusively aboard 26 cruise ships worldwide, produced for the Invicta Watch Group by Mexico's Casa Maestri Distillery. Onboard tastings and personalized activations are offered. Engraving stations for personalizing jewelry are being set up. Mail-order services for most of the jewelry and watch brands sold at Starboard shops began rolling out in mid-May. Passengers can view digital catalogues on iPads to select styles, ring sizes or colors that not on the ship and have them shipped home. Rolling out financing through FlexPay with interest free, interest bearing and buy now, pay later options. The rollout began four months ago on Carnival and is being extended to all Starboard cruise line partners. “Most guests on cruises are celebrating something with their loved ones, whether it's a birthday, an anniversary or a family milestone so they come with a desire to splurge, to discover new brands and items connected to the destination they're traveling to,” Capeci said. “But most importantly, they want to mark the time with something meaningful, and we all know that jewelry and timepieces are among the most special ways to mark an event or a vacation, and remember time spent together with loved ones. For those reasons, most voyages we sell on do quite a nice business in fine jewelry. Fine jewelry and watches are probably 40 percent or more of our total sales. It's very significant.” Sales at Starboard's cruise line boutiques are selling at much higher rate than pre-COVID-19, globally, with the exception of China, Capeci said. “Pre-COVID, we did a significant business on ships sailing out of Shanghai and mainland China. That market has not returned. “The largest region in terms of retail value and sales is the Caribbean by far because of the sheer number of passengers that sail in the Caribbean and the size of the ships,” Capeci said. Cruises in Alaska and the Mediterranean, particularly summertime, also generate “very significant” business. Asked what's selling best, Capeci said: “Diamonds are huge. Yellow gold is huge. Materials that are connected to the destinations they travel to are very important. So if they're going to Australia, they want opals. If they're going to South America, they want green emeralds. The destination they're traveling to and the jewelry that we're offering are always connected. You could buy emeralds at home, but it's not as meaningful as it is when you just visited that location of their origin.” The Invicta brand, founded in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, in 1837, “is one of our most successful and longest running partners for watches,” Capeci said. “They're moving into more lifestyle-driven programs....","The Starboard Group is seizing the moment.

mov_B5A76778D7F7E2CCF221E860E09FF3AB,"  ABSTRACT The designer showed his first men's collection. Was it any good? FULL TEXT A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside - and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power. Inside, dove-gray velvet lined the walls of a temporary event space and displayed two rare 18th-century oils by Jean Siméon Chardin on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland and the Louvre. Robert Pattinson gossiped with Josh O'Connor. Donatella Versace schmoozed with Roger Federer. A pregnant Rihanna arrived with ASAP Rocky a mere 45 minutes after the official start time. That's how much anticipation there was for the Dior men's show. The filmmaker Luca Guadagnino was even trailing around to document the moment. It was Jonathan Anderson's debut as the creative director/savior of the house, the first designer to be put in charge of both men's and women's wear. And under all the buzz, a giant question mark hovered: Could the former Loewe wunderkind reignite excitement not just in the brand but in fashion? Mr. Anderson made it look easy. Literally. Beginning with his take on the Bar jacket, the most famous Dior women's wear shape - the one that prompted the Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow to jump out of her seat shrieking, ""It's a New Look!"" in 1947. It was reimagined in a Donegal tweed with a flat back and a whiff of the hourglass at the front, as if it retained a vague memory of what it once was. With it, he paired not a shirt but a stiff white stock collar and a pair of oversize white cotton cargo shorts, each side sporting elaborate folds to create the plumped out silhouette of a goose, or a 1948 couture dress called the Delft. Go on, shake your tail feathers. If little Lord Fauntleroy had spent a year at U.S.C. and then returned for a pickup game of basketball at Versailles, this is how he might dress. It was not a capital N New Look. It wasn't that radical, or shocking. But it was an awfully charming newish one. And it was situated smack in the middle of the tension between formality and informality, men's wear and women's wear, commerce and creativity (Mr. Anderson's own work at Loewe and Uniqlo and what he inherited at Dior), which seems to define this particular moment. No one is all one thing or another. Neither are their clothes. Neither are the totems of wealth. What Mr. Anderson proposed was a clear and convincing argument that contradictions can gracefully coexist. Most of all, he put forward the belief that fashion and wearability are not irreconcilable ideas - that you either have to look bizarro or look boring. For every highfalutin garment there was an equal and opposite this-old-thing, usually worn together. Velvet frock coats were paired with faded jeans in Japanese denim. Olive green puffer coats and down vests were cut with trapeze backs. The exact pattern of another classic Dior dress, the Caprice, with its elaborately swathed peplum skirt, was applied to a pair of loose khakis, giving one leg the fillip of a drape. An 18th-century frock coat was exactingly reproduced - in moleskin. There were shamrocks on tennis shoes and high-tops with driving shoe soles; cable knits under elaborate waist coats. There was a lot of neck action. Book totes borrowed, again, from the women's line, with actual book titles on them from Baudelaire and Françoise Sagan. Mr. Anderson had clearly done his homework. Easter eggs to early Dior were everywhere. Even the labels inside the clothes were in the designer's preferred silk faille. He was never going to toss everything out the window and start again. He couldn't. Dior is a multibillion-dollar business, after all, and some of his predecessors (Raf Simons, Hedi Slimane, John Galliano) were his idols. Once upon a time, a designer might have had the arrogance to wipe the slate clean, but this is a new age. The industry is in crisis, and the creative tectonic plates are shifting. It is why Mr. Anderson invited seemingly every other designer in Paris to join him at the show. It is also why he picked the Chardin oils and why he seeded his Instagram with Warhol Polaroids of Lee Radziwill and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Chardin, he said in a preview, ""kind of loosened up the still life""; Warhol made pop culture high art. Both crystallized an inflection point in culture....","ABSTRACT The designer showed his first men's collection. Was it any good?

El diseño exclusivo, valorado en 300 mil dólares, causó revuelo en redes sociales y medios internacionales por su confección, simbolismo y la razón emocional detrás de su elección. El diseño fue obra de la casa de moda Dior Haute Couture, conocido por vestir a celebridades en eventos de alto perfil. El vestido, confeccionado a mano en Francia, tardó más de 600 horas de trabajo artesanal y estaba elaborado con seda blanca italiana, bordados personalizados y detalles en pedrería fina. Según fuentes cercanas a la pareja citadas por medios estadounidenses como People y Vogue, Lauren eligió ese vestido no solo por estética, sino por su significado: “Quería algo que representara poder, elegancia y su nueva etapa como mujer y esposa de uno de los empresarios más influyentes del mundo”.

Mientras algunos celebran la elegancia de la elección, otros debaten el costo y el mensaje detrás del lujo. Pero lo cierto es que la boda Bezos-Sánchez ya se ha inscrito entre las más comentadas del año.","SPR_COMBO[es]La boda entre Jeff Bezos, fundador de Amazon, y la periodista y empresaria Lauren Sánchez, no solo fue un evento mediático por el romance, sino también por el espectacular vestido de novia que Sánchez lució el pasado fin de semana. El diseño exclusivo, valorado en 300 mil dólares, causó revuelo en redes sociales y medios internacionales por su confección, simbolismo y la razón emocional detrás de su elección. El diseño fue obra de la casa de moda Dior Haute Couture, conocido por vestir a celebridades en eventos de alto perfil. El vestido, confeccionado a mano en Francia, tardó más de 600 horas de trabajo artesanal y estaba elaborado con seda blanca italiana, bordados personalizados y detalles en pedrería fina. Según fuentes cercanas a la pareja citadas por medios estadounidenses como People y Vogue, Lauren eligió ese vestido no solo por estética, sino por su significado: “Quería algo que representara poder, elegancia y su nueva etapa como mujer y esposa de uno de los empresarios más influyentes del mundo”. Lauren Sánchez eligió estilo con propósito El vestido contaba con una cola de más de tres metros, un corsé entallado y una capa transparente que recordaba a los estilos clásicos hollywoodenses.

mov_2CCEF76AD199EDB8C9E6E24FF8B7DBCB,"  1. Rise in Fashion Industry Enforcement as Green Claims Directive Stalls In recent years, legislative initiatives have increasingly reflected the green agenda and sustainability objectives of the European Commission (the Commission). Authorities have been paying closer attention to unfair commercial practices, including the dissemination of inaccurate corporate responsibility disclosures and false or exaggerated environmental claims. The fashion industry has emerged as a key focus area, with national agencies across Europe intensifying efforts to investigate greenwashing, deceptive labeling, and misleading ethical assertions, especially concerning labour practices. In the past month or so, two pivotal developments unfolded: The first one took place on 25 May 2025, when the Commission formally joined forces with several national competition authorities in urging the online fashion giant SHEIN to comply with EU consumer protection laws. The request followed a coordinated investigation that uncovered suspected fake discounts, manipulation of reviews and ratings, deceptive product labels, and misleading sustainability claims. This joint enforcement action complements a separate, ongoing Commission investigation under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The DSA imposes heightened due diligence obligations aimed at ensuring transparency and consumer trust in digital markets on very large online platforms (VLOPs), and SHEIN was designated a VLOP in April 2024. The second development occurred just last week, when the Commission announced - and later clarified - its intention to withdraw support for the Green Claims Directive (GCD) unless the Council's proposed amendment to include 30 million micro-enterprises within its scope was removed. Micro-enterprises are defined as companies with fewer than 10 employees and less than €2 million in revenue. Originally unveiled in March 2023, the GCD aimed to protect consumers from misleading environmental marketing by requiring companies to have their green claims independently verified. The final text of the Directive had been expected imminently. The Commission's reversal is formally grounded in concerns that the Directive, as amended, would impose a disproportionate administrative burden on small businesses. At the same time, there is growing concern that the GCD's stringent requirements could inadvertently discourage companies from communicating their environmental efforts—a phenomenon known as 'greenhushing'—or worse, deter them from pursuing sustainability initiatives altogether. The uncertainty surrounding the future of the GCD should not be interpreted, without more, as a rollback of the EU's broader sustainability agenda. Rather than signaling a retreat from environmental regulation, the Commission's recent move reflects a recalibration of scope and priorities. It is now up to the co-legislators to consider the Commission's position and renegotiate the Directive's scope. Importantly, the rest of the EU's green regulatory framework—including measures targeting greenwashing—remains intact and continues to advance. We recall that just last year, the Commission adopted two key green directives that embed sustainability into the EU's regulatory fabric. The first is designed to empower consumers during the green transition, strengthening safeguards against unfair commercial practices and ensuring access to reliable, verifiable product information. The second introduces more robust requirements around corporate sustainability reporting, reinforcing transparency and accountability. Member states have until next year to transpose both directives into national law, after which enforcement — particularly around deceptive green claims — is expected to intensify. 2. Reform Milestones As consumer scrutiny of ethical and environmental claims intensifies, the EU has rolled out a series of landmark policies targeting greenwashing, unethical labour practices, and digital consumer risks — particularly in high-impact sectors like fashion. Here is how the regulatory landscape has evolved in recent years: 3. Overview of Investigations Targeting Greenwashing and Unfair Practices Across Europe and the UK EU Investigates SHEIN and Temu Over Online Practices and Consumer Risks The Commission's recent enforcement action against SHEIN underscores the importance and gravity the EU attaches to greenwashing, false ethical claims, and other unfair practices. In this particular case, the Commission is investigating a variety of other SHEIN practices, which range from the presence of illegal goods and content on its platform to the opacity of its recommender system that influences the range of products recommended to users first, through a parallel, complementary DSA inquiry. The Commission has also asked the retailer to provide information on the measures adopted to mitigate risks relating to consumer protection, public health, users' well-being, and the processing of data. Another Chinese e-commerce giant, Temu, received a similar request for information, at the same time as SHEIN, after receipt of a consumer complaint alleging that the exponential increase in Temu's user base is the result of aggressive marketing that may violate EU consumer protection laws, notably articles 7, 34, 35, 38, and 40 of the DSA. The company is under investigation for failure to ensure traceability of those trading on the platform; lack of transparency; and insufficient measures to protect minors and mitigate the risks stemming from the service's allegedly addictive design and illegal product listings. The Dutch Authorities Rigorously Pursue Greenwashing In 2023, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) updated its guidelines on sustainability claims, introducing stricter requirements around clarity, accuracy, and specificity. This followed a wave of enforcement activity that began in 2022, when the ACM launched investigations into corporate green claims across the fashion sector. It concluded that Decathlon and H&M had made vague or misleading sustainability statements. Both companies committed to revising their labeling and online messaging practices and agreed to donate to sustainability causes as partial remediation for their lack of transparency. The ACM also took part in a broader European enforcement initiative examining SHEIN's environmental and ethical claims. Separately, in 2023, the Dutch Advertising Code Committee investigated a greenwashing complaint against Primark, further highlighting regulators' growing focus on sustainability messaging in the fashion industry. From Armani to SHEIN: Italy Scrutinizes Green and Ethical Fashion Claims In July 2024, the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) initiated proceedings and carried out inspections at the premises of Giorgio Armani and Christian Dior for alleged breaches of the Italian Consumer Code in their advertising of clothing and accessories. The Dior probe was closed just last month without finding an infringement after the company gave a set of legally binding commitments designed to address any possible false statements in ethics and social responsibility statements. In September 2024, AGCM also launched an investigation against Infinite Styles for possible generic, vague, confusing, and/or misleading environmental claims made in relation to SHEIN's Italian website. The authority focused on the misleading use of unclear claims such as “'circularity'” and “'green' fibres,” lack of information on additional recyclability of the garment, and contradictions between the company's sustainability reports in previous years and its commitment to decarbonise.

mov_78143AB206C79744674BEC7A8B71B510,"  Luxury fashion houses are increasingly bypassing traditional media outlets and forging direct relationships with fashion creators through social media, offering exclusive previews and behind-the-scenes access. This shift, observed during the recent menswear season, signals a strategic realignment in how brands build hype and control their narrative. On June 24, Pharrell Williams, the creative director of Louis Vuitton Men's, personally messaged Albert Ayal, a talent scout for the fashion Instagram account @UpNextDesigner, with early details of the collection. “Hey — wanted you to be the first to see details of the collection from tonight's LV Men's show. Sending some pics soon,” the message read, originating from the @Skateboard Instagram account, Louis Vuitton's platform for behind-the-scenes content. Ayal promptly shared a screenshot of the direct message to his Instagram story. The Rise of the DM Reveal Ayal's experience wasn't isolated. Bally extended a similar courtesy to Scott Staniland, a sustainable fashion creator and consultant, sending him a photograph from the brand's Milan presentation, which Staniland then shared with his followers. Maison Margiela took a slightly different approach, directly inviting fashion critic Ashantéa Austin to its couture show via direct message, a moment Austin documented and shared as a reel. Perhaps the most proactive strategy came from Dior. In anticipation of Jonathan Anderson's menswear debut, the brand added content creator and fashion critic Hanan Besovic (@IDeserveCouture) to its Instagram “Close Friends” list. This granted Besovic exclusive access to sneak peeks of Anderson's mood boards and handbag designs, content she subsequently shared on both TikTok and Instagram. A New Era of Brand-Influencer Dynamics This trend represents a significant departure from traditional public relations practices. By directly engaging with key influencers, luxury brands are attempting to cultivate a more authentic and immediate connection with their target audiences. The practice also allows for greater control over messaging, as brands can share information directly, unfiltered by journalistic interpretation. The willingness of creators to publicly share these direct messages – screenshots and reels – further amplifies the brand's reach, effectively turning the initial outreach into additional marketing content. This symbiotic relationship highlights the growing power of social media marketing within the luxury sector and the increasing value placed on the curated perspectives of online tastemakers. The move towards direct engagement suggests a broader industry recognition that traditional media cycles are no longer sufficient to generate the desired level of buzz and consumer excitement. Instead, brands are prioritizing speed, exclusivity, and the perceived authenticity of influencer endorsements. This strategy is likely to continue evolving as the digital landscape shifts and new platforms emerge.

mov_0C31A16BA2532CF9CF37DA75CA81F56B,"  Change is afoot as fashion's musical chairs comes to a halt. When it comes to shifts in creative direction, menswear collections and the vision they represent have always served as the tip of the iceberg in signalling where the brand is headed. Often, they reflect a calculated risk or a tamer approach that holds more tightly to the brand's core values, in consideration of their male consumers and a smaller vernacular of silhouettes to play with. As Men's Fashion Week comes to an end, Men's Folio dissects the Top 5 trends for Spring/Summer 2026. FIT FLOP Where we come from, there has always been a slightly negative connotation when it comes to pairing open-toed footwear with trousers — anything but shorts, really. Can Spring/Summer 2026 usher in a shift in the perception commonly associated with a lack of sartorial care when one dons their slides or sandals with denim or chinos? As demonstrated by Hermes, Yohji Yamamoto and Dolce & Gabbana, what makes their trouser and chancla pairing feel like the epitome of casual summer dressing comes down to the fluidity of the trousers. A rigid dress pant may feel out of place, but lightweight materials that flow create a congruent impression when worn with sandals. This explains why the Dolce's “business on top, slumber party at the bottom” ensemble looks harmonious. DRAMATIC SUITING Suits in the summer should be anything but stuffy — across their construction, materials and finishes. The Power Suit takes on a slightly different connotation at Louis Gabriel Nouchi's Spring/Summer 26 collection, as he explores the notion of power through the lens of sexuality. Eroticism does not mean being unclothed, as Nouchi presents relaxed double-breasted suits styled with latex ties. Silhouettes portraying dramatic shoulders and a nipped-in waist take place, inspired by the Zoot Suit, are seen across EgonLab and Wooyoungmi, perhaps as a trickle-down effect from the last Met Gala that showcased facets of black dandyism. The most direct nod comes from Willy Chavarria during his PFW showcase, where the suit has been used to symbolise the identity and influence of immigrants, referencing his cultural upbringing. PRECARIOUS PASTELS Can pastels still be groundbreaking for Spring/Summer? Sure, answers Zegna, Prada and and Jonathan Anderson's debut collection for Dior. Rather than just desaturated colours for a demure impression, Zegna portrays a palette bleached by the sun from constant exposure, while Prada juxtaposed its simple silhouettes with sickly, off-kilter pastels that still commanded attention. Although Dior's use of pastels comes across as a display of affluence in ways an affinity for light-coloured clothing may convey a nonchalance towards wear, Willy Chavarria's take carries a form of rebellion worn on the backs of the working class. GO TO SLEEP, GIRL Amazing what rest and relaxation does to tired minds. Loungewear takes on a more literal interpretation — beyond just relaxed shirtings and short shorts for Spring/Summer 26. Dolce & Gabbana materialises the concept of rolling out your bed and starting your day immediately through a collection of pyjamas, worn together or as separates in all their wrinkled glory. AMIRI envisions winding down at their fictional Chateau through luxurious smoking jackets and matching lounge pants, complete with leather slippers. WHEN I GROW UP Through the lens of a child, the adult world may forge an impression of limitless opportunities and freedom. Before the concept of a business analyst or an SEO writer comes into their worldview as more conventional career pathways, there is an optimism tied to how work and adulthood are presented — as a pursuit of joy and self-driven purpose, rather than stakeholder value. Painters are seen on the runways, where childhood ambition is interpreted through paint-stained workwear at KidSuper and vests to hold paintbrushes at Homme Plisse Issey Miyake. Kenzo also proposes a joyful wardrobe that envisions adult dressing with a juvenile flair, through playful Lisa Frank-style illustrations, band jackets (also seen on the runways of Dior) and stickerbombed flat-brim caps.

2589BEB9B14AC7175588ED5AAA109DC6,"  A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside -- and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power. Inside, dove-gray velvet lined the walls of a temporary event space and displayed two rare 18th-century oils by Jean Siméon Chardin on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland and the Louvre. Robert Pattinson gossiped with Josh O'Connor. Donatella Versace schmoozed with Roger Federer. A pregnant Rihanna arrived with ASAP Rocky a mere 45 minutes after the official start time. That's how much anticipation there was for the Dior men's show. The filmmaker Luca Guadagnino was even trailing around to document the moment. It was Jonathan Anderson's debut as the creative director/savior of the house, the first designer to be put in charge of both men's and women's wear. And under all the buzz, a giant question mark hovered: Could the former Loewe wunderkind reignite excitement not just in the brand but in fashion? Mr. Anderson made it look easy. Literally. Beginning with his take on the Bar jacket, the most famous Dior women's wear shape -- the one that prompted the Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow to jump out of her seat shrieking, ''It's a New Look!'' in 1947. It was reimagined in a Donegal tweed with a flat back and a whiff of the hourglass at the front, as if it retained a vague memory of what it once was. With it, he paired not a shirt but a stiff white stock collar and a pair of oversize white cotton cargo shorts, each side sporting elaborate folds to create the plumped out silhouette of a goose, or a 1948 couture dress called the Delft. Go on, shake your tail feathers. If little Lord Fauntleroy had spent a year at U.S.C. and then returned for a pickup game of basketball at Versailles, this is how he might dress. It was not a capital N New Look. It wasn't that radical, or shocking. But it was an awfully charming newish one. And it was situated smack in the middle of the tension between formality and informality, men's wear and women's wear, commerce and creativity (Mr. Anderson's own work at Loewe and Uniqlo and what he inherited at Dior), which seems to define this particular moment. No one is all one thing or another. Neither are their clothes. Neither are the totems of wealth. What Mr. Anderson proposed was a clear and convincing argument that contradictions can gracefully coexist. Most of all, he put forward the belief that fashion and wearability are not irreconcilable ideas -- that you either have to look bizarro or look boring. For every highfalutin garment there was an equal and opposite this-old-thing, usually worn together. Velvet frock coats were paired with faded jeans in Japanese denim. Olive green puffer coats and down vests were cut with trapeze backs. The exact pattern of another classic Dior dress, the Caprice, with its elaborately swathed peplum skirt, was applied to a pair of loose khakis, giving one leg the fillip of a drape. An 18th-century frock coat was exactingly reproduced -- in moleskin. There were shamrocks on tennis shoes and high-tops with driving shoe soles; cable knits under elaborate waist coats. There was a lot of neck action. Book totes borrowed, again, from the women's line, with actual book titles on them from Baudelaire and Françoise Sagan. Mr. Anderson had clearly done his homework. Easter eggs to early Dior were everywhere. Even the labels inside the clothes were in the designer's preferred silk faille. He was never going to toss everything out the window and start again. He couldn't. Dior is a multibillion-dollar business, after all, and some of his predecessors (Raf Simons, Hedi Slimane, John Galliano) were his idols. Once upon a time, a designer might have had the arrogance to wipe the slate clean, but this is a new age. The industry is in crisis, and the creative tectonic plates are shifting. It is why Mr. Anderson invited seemingly every other designer in Paris to join him at the show. It is also why he picked the Chardin oils and why he seeded his Instagram with Warhol Polaroids of Lee Radziwill and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Chardin, he said in a preview, ''kind of loosened up the still life''; Warhol made pop culture high art. Both crystallized an inflection point in culture. Mr. Anderson clearly wants his Dior to do the same. His show invitation came borne on a china plate with three china eggs on top, as if a reminder that the men's wear was just the beginning (and maybe to acknowledge that some shells may get broken along the way). Fair enough. The result may not knock you sideways, but it's likely to make you sit up and buy....","A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside -- and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power.

On Friday in Paris, the Northern Irish designer Jonathan Anderson will show his first collection as the creative director of the French fashion house Dior. During his previous, 11-year tenure as the creative director of the Spanish brand Loewe, Anderson became known for his avant-garde sensibility and dedication to craft -- but also for his unique ability to turn the internet's so-called boyfriends (those young actors and musicians who are lusted over online with possessive familiarity) into bona fide celebrities. In the front row of Anderson's fall 2024 Loewe men's wear show in Paris were the established actors Jamie Dornan, Andrew Garfield and Nicholas Hoult, but also, seated with equal prominence, emerging ones, including Drew Starkey, who was set to star in ''Queer'' (the 2024 Luca Guadagnino movie for which Anderson oversaw the costumes), and Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist, who would soon appear as romantic leads in Guadagnino's film ''Challengers,'' a film that helped them reach mainstream heartthrob status, and with which Anderson was also involved as a costume designer. The following June, at Anderson's final Loewe men's runway show, the rising actors Kit Connor, Evan Peters and Enzo Vogrincic sat front row -- suggesting, based on the strength of the designer's track record, that they too would also soon become leading men. For Loewe, it was a display of cultural currency; for the actors, it was free publicity. It used to be that an association with a brand was, if not a career-killer, then certainly not chic for an actor. It was hard to be taken seriously as both an artist and a de facto fashion model. But in recent decades, the rise of social media and the expansion of the fashion industry have blurred the lines between model, actor and influencer. Back in the 1980s, the Italian fashion house Armani began dressing Hollywood celebrities, including, most notably, Richard Gere for his role in the 1980 movie ''American Gigolo.'' But gone are the days when one megastar served as a company's global face. Today brands adopt a multitiered system of ambassadors that includes international stars, yes, but also up-and-comers and influencers. While these cliques are often described by their members and parent brands as ''family,'' and frequently represent a genuine affinity, they are also carefully constructed to maximize a company's exposure on red carpets and billboards -- but also very specific corners of TikTok. Now, as this business decision solidifies into standard practice, the question is, Who ultimately wields the power, the celebrities or the brands? Until 2010, ''a few brands had ambassadors, but it was mainly for fragrance,'' says Ben Cercio, the founder of a consulting agency specializing in brand strategy and communications with clients including the French fashion house Givenchy. But with the launch of Instagram that year, a shift occurred: companies began to engage not just with major actors but also with ''microinfluencers'' -- online personalities with less than 100,000 followers -- to reach their audiences early on. And because social media has accelerated the rise to fame, whenever a new talent in any field emerges from the crowd, ''every brand wants to get its hands on them,'' says Cercio. Now an ingénue like the actress Mikey Madison, who starred in last year's ''Anora,'' might have a dozen offers from brands immediately after making a buzzy debut at a festival like Cannes, suggesting that it's often the young actors, rather than the brands, who are in control. When Madison accepted her Oscar for best lead actress in March, she wore a custom look from Dior. Cercio adds that while relationships once developed organically -- a talent would come to a fashion show, be given some pieces and maybe wear something from the latest collection on the red carpet -- increasingly, ''money is very quickly involved.'' Indeed, an ambassadorship is now a coveted deal among celebrities of all tiers. '' There's enough proof in the market of just how great a partnership can look,'' says George Georgopoulos, the director of brand partnerships at Huxley, an agency that represents artists including Charli XCX. After releasing her globally successful album ''Brat,'' last summer, the pop star partnered with companies from H&M to Acne Studios and performed with a seemingly empty Gucci bag on ''Saturday Night Live'' in what appeared to be a wink-wink placement. (She'd headlined the brand's annual LACMA Gala a few weeks before.) Getting a check for simply holding an object, she seemed to imply, was not selling out but making the system work for her. For many celebrities, ''there's more money in the ambassadorship than in a lot of the payments they receive for their work onscreen,'' says the writer and pop culture podcaster Evan Ross Katz. Those funds can free up major actors to pursue less commercial projects, like indie films and plays; they are also increasingly essential for younger performers who aren't yet earning large sums for their creative work. Depending on their level of fame, a celebrity can make anywhere from $50,000 to many millions of dollars with endorsement deals, according to several people who work on confidential contracts. On the lower end are social media posts: An artist with a significant following could be paid $100,000 to $150,000 for a single main-grid post holding a product and tagging a brand. If their following is in the multiple millions, however, these numbers can reach seven figures, one stylist said. Slightly more lucrative are red-carpet appearances. And on the higher end are elaborate contracts that require more than just showing up at Fashion Week twice a year. A deal worth around $3 million, for example, could involve appearing in advertising campaigns, attending events like store openings, being dressed for the red carpet, wearing the brand out more casually for paparazzi shots and creating several social media posts. The prestige of an endorsement deal can also boost the cachet of a relatively unknown artist or internet personality immeasurably. Katz cites the YouTuber Emma Chamberlain and the pop star Addison Rae as two recent examples of social media stars whose fame has grown well beyond their original audience, partly because of their fashion partnerships. Since 2019, Chamberlain has been an ambassador for Louis Vuitton; last year, Rae appeared in a campaign film for Saint Laurent. Likewise, while celebrity ambassadors might not necessarily move units for brands in the short term -- unless they have the influence of a Kardashian or a Hadid -- they give companies exposure to niche but devoted audiences. By putting the actor Jeremy Allen White on a billboard, for example, Calvin Klein helped transform a nascent sex symbol into the kind of established idol the brand more typically casts -- and it got to be a part of the cultural conversation following the success of White's show ''The Bear.'' And when, last summer, Marc Jacobs recruited the viral TikTok chef Nara Smith to ''make'' one of the brand's tote bags from baking ingredients in a tongue-in-cheek video, Smith gained fashion credibility, while the brand got to create a social media moment of its own. Both parties signaled that they were in on the joke. But not all relationships are the right match. '' I remember this desire for fashion to lead the conversation and not follow it,'' says Katz. '' Part of me worries that that's beginning to shift.'' Still, brands are continuing to experiment with new models...","And what's in it for the brands?

mov_F4B5B8543CB34C8AB29B72ECA9E19296,"  SPR_COMBO[es]La tendencia de “maquillaje sin maquillaje” sigue fuerte, pero con un giro: ahora no solo queremos lucir frescas, también estructuradas. Y para lograrlo sin 17 productos ni gastar una fortuna, entra en escena Rimmel London Sculpting Palette, una joya low cost con tres tonos que trabajan en sinergia: bronceador, iluminador y colorete, todo en un compacto que cabe en cualquier bolso y cuesta apenas 6 euros. ¿Lo mejor? No es una paleta cualquiera. Fue desarrollada junto a Kate Moss, quien aporta ese toque cool británico a una fórmula práctica y efectiva. La promesa de la paleta es clara: esculpir, iluminar y dar color al rostro con naturalidad. Pero en la práctica, también ofrece versatilidad total: El bronceador es de tono neutro, sin subtono naranja, ideal para contorno sutil o efecto sunkissed. El iluminador tiene destello fino, nada glitter, que aporta ese glow elegante estilo Hailey Bieber. El rubor es rosa-melocotón universal, favorecedor en todo tipo de pieles, que da ese toque de vitalidad instantánea. Además, su textura sedosa y modulable permite trabajar las capas sin dejar manchones ni exceso de polvo. Se difumina fácil con brocha, esponja o incluso con los dedos si estás fuera de casa. Rimmel no es nuevo en el juego, pero esta paleta lleva meses en los primeros puestos de ventas de Amazon y es protagonista de muchos tutoriales en TikTok y YouTube. ¿La razón? Hace el trabajo de tres productos de lujo en un solo gesto. Muchas influencers la comparan con: La Filmstar Bronze & Glow de Charlotte Tilbury (pero 40 euros más barata). El Dior Backstage Glow Face Palette, por su efecto de segunda piel. O incluso con Fenty Beauty, en cuanto a practicidad y pigmentación. Además, en un contexto donde buscamos optimizar rutinas y espacio (bye neceser gigante), una paleta todo en uno tiene un valor emocional: es eficiente, compacta y libre de complicaciones. Por 6 euros, la Rimmel Sculpting Palette ofrece calidad, practicidad y versatilidad. Perfecta para principiantes, minimalistas, chicas que viajan o quienes buscan un glow con poco esfuerzo. No sustituye a productos de gama alta en textura extrema o larga duración tipo red carpet, pero para el día a día y looks de oficina o citas, es más que suficiente. Además, es un recordatorio de que el buen maquillaje no tiene por qué costar una fortuna. Porque al final, el estilo es lo que haces con lo que tienes, no lo que cuesta. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]La tendencia de “maquillaje sin maquillaje” sigue fuerte, pero con un giro: ahora no solo queremos lucir frescas, también estructuradas.

Olivia Palamountain reports Venice's Hotel Cipriani has launched an exclusive Dior bar as part of its 2025 season reopening, marking a new collaboration between the legendary hospitality brand and the French luxury fashion house. Il Bacaro Dior (open Tuesday to Sunday from 6.30pm to 11.30pm) takes in glorious views over St. Mark's basin and features rattan furniture offset by cushions upholstered in green toile de Jouy - a heritage printed cloth produced by Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf in the 18th century. To amplify the branded experience, guests can take archipelago excursions on boats bearing the Dior signature. Located moments from St Mark's Square via the hotel's private boat service, Hotel Cipriani sits on the tip of the island with panoramic views across the Venetian lagoon. The property, which became Belmond's first acquisition in 1976, features Venice's largest private swimming pool, the over-water Cip's Club restaurant and the Casanova wellness centre. Alongside the bar, the luxury fashion house has installed a Dioriviera boutique, selling a collection of branded resortwear. The boutique features art installations including a large bamboo mural by Korakot and a glass sculpture by Simone Crestani, alongside hand-made furniture by Italian manufacturer Bonacina. Also new for 2025 are a series of renovations by architect and interior designer Peter Marino, who has overseen the refined redesign of 13 rooms including two master suites designed as Venetian apartments. Marino's multi-phase renovation includes two master suites featuring dining rooms, libraries and salons with lagoon views, plus 11 suites and junior suites with private balconies overlooking the Casanova Gardens. The architect has maintained the beloved lobby whilst creating an adjacent double-height arrival experience. New lagoon experiences for the summer season include sunset tours and enhanced dining at the Michelin-starred Oro restaurant, led by Chef Yana Ghedini in collaboration with world-renowned chef Massimo Bottura. The Il Bacaro Dior bar and Dioriviera boutique represent the latest luxury brand partnership for the Belmond property, which has operated on Giudecca Island since 1958. Elsewhere this year, Dior has also been busy. In March 2025, The Royal Scotsman, A Belmond Train, collaborated with Dior to create its first wellness retreat on wheels, featuring 'mindful movement' classes and naturopathic menus.

Dior revealed the campaign first via an Instagram Story Close Friends activation, leaking the images to select editors and talents – whom Dior added to the Close Friends feature on Instagram. Before the show, whose opening look was a take on the Bar jacket paired with voluminously pleated cargo shorts, Dior broadcast a film depicting “The White Lotus” actor Sam Nivola in Versailles and guests – including Robert Pattinson – getting ready in their hotel rooms before arriving at the venue. As additional content, Dior released a podcast with Karen Binns and an audiobook based on the founding couturier's autobiography “Christian Dior et Moi,” read in French by Louis Garrel, who also attended the show. This was the soundtrack as guests filed into the show venue, modeled after Berlin's Gemäldegalerie museum. Other celebrities in attendance included Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Roger Federer, Sabrina Carpenter, Daniel Craig and Drew Starkey.","TRAFFIC PATTERNS: The curiosity about Jonathan Anderson's Dior debut was real.

We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Once again, at this year's Wimbledon tournament, the only thing distracting from the tennis is the court-side style. “Wimbledon has turned the stands into a catwalk, and I am here for it,” says model and presenter Leomie Anderson, who is covering Wimbledon as Clearpay's fashion expert this season. If recent years saw guests erring on the side of safe – quiet luxury defined by demure dresses, boxy blazers and the occasional fascinator – 2025 has shifted gear. “There's a real shift happening,” Anderson explains, “people used to play it safe with blazers, midi dresses, the usual suspects. But this year, the crowd is serving. It's like everyone got the memo that Wimbledon is just as much a style moment as it is a sport.” And the stats back her up. Broderie anglaise is booming – with maxi dresses up 147%, skirts up 33% – hats are having a high-fashion renaissance with floppy styles up 99%, and butter-yellow is surging according to Clearpay. The best celebrity looks managed to balance their personality with a playful nod to the tournament's stereotypes – from Wimbledon whites to strawberries and cream. “There's something powerful about its simplicity, the traditions – the setting, the subtlety,” says Anderson. “People know they have to bring their A-game.” Here are some of the best-dressed celebrities at the tournament so far and how they aced Wimbledon style. Olivia Rodrigo A masterstroke in edging up tradition, singer Olivia Rodrigo, 22, wore a red gingham shirt dress by Ralph Lauren from the spring/summer 2000 archive – a playful nod to Wimbledon's iconic strawberries and cream. Her boyfriend, Louis Partridge, 22, coordinated in a red striped tie and navy blazer. Following her headlining performance at Glastonbury Festival on Sunday, Rodrigo managed to nail the elusive balance of British heritage and Gen Z irreverence. Anna and Michael Murray Also sticking to Wimble classics was retail tycoon and CEO of Frasers Group, Michael Murray, who went traditional in a linen white suit, a cream Panama and brown suede loafers. His wife Anna wore the print of the season in a tulle black and white polka dot midi dress, with black suede pumps and black leather Birkin. Cate Blanchett Actress Cate Blanchett, 56, stood out on Centre Court in a pearlescent Prince of Wales check suit by Giorgio Armani. Sharply tailored but soft in palette, it was a classic Blanchett power move, turning heads without the noise. “Cate's baby blue tartan suit was effortless and elegant,” Anderson puts it, “that classic tailoring is signature Cate cool.” Leslie Mann Wimbledon whites are a fail-safe style to sport year after year. While they run the risk of becoming repetitive and – dare I say – boring; when styled right with interesting cuts, whites can be as elegant as ever. Actress Leslie Mann, 53, appeared on day three in an ivory Dior bar jacket and delicate lace skirt. The look was reminiscent of the Princess of Wales recent Self Portrait ensemble at the Order of the Garter in June. David Beckham One thing more certain than spotting a cream Panama hat in the Wimbledon stands is spotting David Beckham. The 50-year-old former footballer once again brought off-court elegance in a cream silk-linen suit from his own Boss collaboration, finished with a chocolate brown tie. The only fashion blunder was plaster cast on his right arm – though even that couldn't detract from his summer suiting credentials. Dominic Cooper Unlike Beckham, 47 year-old actor Dominic Cooper opted out of the classic Wimbledon look and sported a bright powder blue suit with matching trainers. “I'm seeing bold colour choices […] and people leaning into what makes their style unique,” says Anderson of the look. Cooper reminded us that co-ordination doesn't have to mean stiff – and tonal can be a statement when done right. Tom Daley Dusky teal was Olympic diver Tom Daley's shade of choice – cool and contemporary and a refreshing break from Wimbledon white. Daley, 31, paired the Paul Smith suit with a Christian Louboutin clutch and a Chopard watch. Judy Murray Mother to former Wimbledon champion Sir Andy Murray, Judy Murray chose a sunshine-yellow Me+Em dress with white platform trainers. The cheerful dress was bang on trend, with butter yellow emerging as the summer's sleeper hit....","Your support helps us to tell the story From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Once again, at this year's Wimbledon tournament, the only thing distracting from the tennis is the court-side style. “Wimbledon has turned the stands into a catwalk, and I am here for it,” says model and presenter Leomie Anderson, who is covering Wimbledon as Clearpay's fashion expert this season. If recent years saw guests erring on the side of safe – quiet luxury defined by demure dresses, boxy blazers and the occasional fascinator – 2025 has shifted gear. “There's a real shift happening,” Anderson explains, “people used to play it safe with blazers, midi dresses, the usual suspects. But this year, the crowd is serving. It's like everyone got the memo that Wimbledon is just as much a style moment as it is a sport.” And the stats back her up. Broderie anglaise is booming – with maxi dresses up 147%, skirts up 33% – hats are having a high-fashion renaissance with floppy styles up 99%, and butter-yellow is surging according to Clearpay. The best celebrity looks managed to balance their personality with a playful nod to the tournament's stereotypes – from Wimbledon whites to strawberries and cream. “There's something powerful about its simplicity, the traditions – the setting, the subtlety,” says Anderson. “People know they have to bring their A-game.” Here are some of the best-dressed celebrities at the tournament so far and how they aced Wimbledon style. Olivia Rodrigo A masterstroke in edging up tradition, singer Olivia Rodrigo, 22, wore a red gingham shirt dress by Ralph Lauren from the spring/summer 2000 archive – a playful nod to Wimbledon's iconic strawberries and cream. Her boyfriend, Louis Partridge, 22, coordinated in a red striped tie and navy blazer. Following her headlining performance at Glastonbury Festival on Sunday, Rodrigo managed to nail the elusive balance of British heritage and Gen Z irreverence. Anna and Michael Murray Also sticking to Wimble classics was retail tycoon and CEO of Frasers Group, Michael Murray, who went traditional in a linen white suit, a cream Panama and brown suede loafers. His wife Anna wore the print of the season in a tulle black and white polka dot midi dress, with black suede pumps and black leather Birkin. Cate Blanchett Actress Cate Blanchett, 56, stood out on Centre Court in a pearlescent Prince of Wales check suit by Giorgio Armani. Sharply tailored but soft in palette, it was a classic Blanchett power move, turning heads without the noise. “Cate's baby blue tartan suit was effortless and elegant,” Anderson puts it, “that classic tailoring is signature Cate cool.” Leslie Mann Wimbledon whites are a fail-safe style to sport year after year. While they run the risk of becoming repetitive and – dare I say – boring; when styled right with interesting cuts, whites can be as elegant as ever. Actress Leslie Mann, 53, appeared on day three in an ivory Dior bar jacket and delicate lace skirt. The look was reminiscent of the Princess of Wales recent Self Portrait ensemble at the Order of the Garter in June. David Beckham One thing more certain than spotting a cream Panama hat in the Wimbledon stands is spotting David Beckham. The 50-year-old former footballer once again brought off-court elegance in a cream silk-linen suit from his own Boss collaboration, finished with a chocolate brown tie. The only fashion blunder was plaster cast on his right arm – though even that couldn't detract from his summer suiting credentials. Dominic Cooper Unlike Beckham, 47 year-old actor Dominic Cooper opted out of the classic Wimbledon look and sported a bright powder blue suit with matching trainers. “I'm seeing bold colour choices […] and people leaning into what makes their style unique,” says Anderson of the look. Cooper reminded us that co-ordination doesn't have to mean stiff – and tonal can be a statement when done right. Tom Daley Dusky teal was Olympic diver Tom Daley's shade of choice – cool and contemporary and a refreshing break from Wimbledon white. Daley, 31, paired the Paul Smith suit with a Christian Louboutin clutch and a Chopard watch. Judy Murray Mother to former Wimbledon champion Sir Andy Murray, Judy Murray chose a sunshine-yellow Me+Em dress with white platform trainers.

mov_B6B73E99B398B687DFCEE498EA2E43D0,"  While the world's top tennis players battle it out on the hallowed courts of Wimbledon, it's the increasingly bold fashion statements from the stands that are truly serving up a spectacle this year. The annual tournament, long associated with understated elegance, appears to have transformed its spectator areas into an unexpected runway. ""Wimbledon has turned the stands into a catwalk, and I am here for it,"" declares model and presenter Leomie Anderson, who is covering the event as Clearpay's fashion expert this season. Her observation highlights a significant shift from recent years, which saw guests largely adhering to a ""quiet luxury"" aesthetic defined by demure dresses, boxy blazers, and the occasional fascinator. “There's a real shift happening,” Anderson says. “People used to play it safe with blazers, midi dresses, the usual suspects. But this year, the crowd is serving. It's like everyone got the memo that Wimbledon is just as much a style moment as it is a sport.” This sartorial revolution is backed by compelling data from Clearpay. Broderie anglaise, a delicate embroidered fabric, is experiencing a significant boom, with maxi dresses in the style seeing a 147 per cent increase and skirts up by 33 per cent. Hats are also enjoying a high-fashion renaissance, with floppy styles surging by 99 per cent. Adding a splash of colour to the courtside scene, butter-yellow has emerged as a dominant trend, according to the payment platform. The best celebrity looks managed to balance the wearer's personality with a playful nod to the tournament's stereotypes – from Wimbledon whites to strawberries and cream. “There's something powerful about its simplicity, the traditions – the setting, the subtlety,” says Anderson. “People know they have to bring their A-game.” Here are some of the best-dressed celebrities at the tournament so far and how they aced Wimbledon style.

urn:li:ugcPost:7346540675452043265,"  Officially an HEC Alumna I am proud to share that I have recently graduated from the MSc in Marketing at HEC Paris! From the very first day, we were immersed in a culture of excellence. We were encouraged by industry leaders and inspiring speakers to think boldly, communicate with purpose, and push the boundaries of what we believed possible. Throughout the program, I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects with some of the most influential names in the industry. We developed a 360° strategy for L'Oréal  La Roche-Posay Laboratoire Dermatologique, created a new fragrance concept for Parfums Christian Dior, reimagined Veepee's approach to Gen Z, crafted a sustainability narrative for Amazon  in collaboration with DDB  and tackled a strategic consulting case with McKinsey & Company, among others. We also attended thought-provoking conferences, including a particularly memorable session with Marc Chaya, CEO and Co-founder of Maison Francis Kurkdjian, which left a lasting impression on me. Beyond the projects and events, I explored new fields, refined critical skills, and experienced meaningful personal and professional growth. This was made possible thanks to the dedication of our professors and the collaboration of brilliant classmates who made the experience truly exceptional. I am especially grateful to our Program Director, Gachoucha Kretz, PhD, and Program Manager, Marion BOUYOU, whose leadership and support shaped the quality of this journey. Their clear vision, thoughtful mentorship, and ongoing encouragement provided the structure and motivation that will continue to guide me well beyond HEC. The year concluded with a study trip to London, where we visited the HEC in the UK office and engaged with inspiring teams at Puig  EssilorLuxottica  and Netflix This milestone marks the end of an extraordinary journey and the beginning of an exciting new chapter✨ #HECParis #Graduation #Marketing #Master #HECAlumni #LearnToDare","Officially an HEC Alumna I am proud to share that I have recently graduated from the MSc in Marketing at HEC Paris!

mov_0AE0CD3CA2DCF34CA5018FF6B22A4B2E,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Abbey Clancy's daughter Sophia showed she has taken after her model mother as she joined her famous family and footballer father Peter Crouch at the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club for day four of Wimbledon on Thursday. The daughter to the famous couple, 14, showed off her resemblance to her mother as she was seen topping up her lip gloss in the crowd. She joined Abbey, 39, and Peter, 44, who looked happier than ever and packed on the PDA with a kiss while sat in Centre Court, as she stepped out in an all white ensemble. For the outing, Sophie put on a very glamorous display as she toted her belongings around in a black leather Miu Miu bag. It appears that she also has her mother's eye for designer accessories, as she accessorised with four Christian Dior cloth bracelets, each worth a whopping £250. To finish her sporting day outfit, Sophia was seen wearing false eyelashes as she applied a layer of Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip gloss. Meanwhile Abbey - who is also a mother to Liberty, nine, Johnny, seven, and Jack, five - looked incredible for the outing as she wore a yellow striped suit. Liverpool football legend Peter, looked handsome as he attended the event in a casual blue shirt. Abbey has had a highly successful modelling career, while she's also branched out into presenting, novel writing and even won Strictly Come Dancing back in 2013. And Sophia has taken nepotism in her stride as she made her modelling debut aged eight when she joined Abbey for a Lipsy shoot. Sophia has reportedly had 'loads of offers' already from agencies as she is being dubbed the 'next Lila Moss' A source told Heat World: 'Sophia is getting lots of offers from modelling agencies. They see her as the next big thing, thanks to her looking like Abbey and having Pete's height. 'She has already done campaigns with her mum, but now big-name agencies are desperate to sign her and turn her into the next Lila Moss.' Centre Court spectators will be watching Jack Draper compete against 2017 Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic and Dan Evans takes on Novak Djokovic. Draper, the current world No4, takes on 2017 Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic this afternoon as he looks to progress past the second round for the first time at SW19. World number one Jannik Sinner is also back in the spotlight, up against Aleksandar Vukic, whilst Iga Swiatek plays Caty McNally in the other Centre Court match. Judy Murray has opened up on the secrets of the Royal Box at Wimbledon as celebrity guests continue to flood into Wimbledon. While there are 18 Championship grass courts at SW19, all eyes are often on the historic Centre Court, which plays host to the best stars the sport has to offer as they compete for glory. Centre Court boasts nearly 15,000 seats, meaning lucky punters can be seen cheering on their favourites, and are joined by guests in the Royal Box at around lunchtime each day. So far this week, the likes of John Cena, Thomas Tuchel and Olivia Rodrigo have all been present, with all three part of a star-studded line-up in the Box on Wednesday. On Tuesday Judy, renown for her coaching work in the sport and her support for tennis-playing sons Andy and Jamie, made an appearance. Before her trip, she opened up on what it is like in the Royal Box on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with The National Lottery on Virgin Radio UK. 'Royal Boxing should be a verb, shouldn't it?' she said.' It should be a summer verb.' She added: 'Well, you arrive usually around 11.30, so you go upstairs, they have a champagne reception, then you go in for lunch and you could be sitting beside absolutely anybody at lunch. There's no seating plan, it's just as you go into the room. 'It's in the clubhouse of the All England Club, and the first year that I went I took my mum, of course, and we sat with Jack Nicklaus. I sat with a few years ago a lady who was the first female Spitfire pilot. I mean it's just you could be with absolutely anybody and the stories are fascinating. 'It's really tough when the sun comes round because there's no escape. 'It's actually I think worse for the guys because they have to wear a jacket and tie and they're not allowed to take the jacket off unless the royalty in the box takes their jacket off first. That's the protocol.'","Have YOU got a story?

mov_486D9E815810C5AB51AE53BFBCE2AA9E,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Somos referencia obligada en Tlaxcala. Muchas personas usan el término “perfume” para referirse a cualquier fragancia, pero no todas tienen la misma concentración ni duración. Las diferencias entre un perfume, un eau de parfum y un eau de toilette no solo radican en su nombre, sino también en su composición, intensidad y uso recomendado. Conocer estas variaciones es clave para elegir la opción más adecuada según el estilo de vida, el clima y el presupuesto. En el mercado mexicano, existe una amplia oferta que incluye desde marcas internacionales de alta gama hasta opciones accesibles y funcionales. Cada formato tiene sus ventajas dependiendo del contexto: si se busca una fragancia duradera para un evento especial, o algo más fresco y liviano para el día a día. Comprender estas diferencias ayuda a evitar errores comunes, cómo comprar una fragancia demasiado intensa para el uso diario. Este artículo detalla las particularidades de cada tipo de producto, presenta ejemplos representativos y ofrece recomendaciones prácticas para encontrar la fragancia ideal, ya sea de firmas de lujo o de marcas populares como los perfumes Aeropostale, Calvin Klein, Zara o Tous. Diferencias fundamentales entre las concentraciones Cada tipo de fragancia tiene una formulación distinta que influye directamente en su duración y proyección. ¿Qué es un perfume? El perfume o extrait de parfum es el formato más concentrado. Su contenido de aceites esenciales suele estar entre el 20 % y el 30 %, lo que le confiere una duración prolongada, a veces superior a 12 horas en la piel. Este tipo de fragancia es más costosa, pero también más persistente y sofisticada. Ejemplos comunes de perfumes concentrados incluyen Chanel No. 5 Extrait, Dior J'adore L'Absolu o Amouage Interlude Woman. Por su intensidad, se recomienda aplicarlos con moderación y reservarlos para eventos especiales o climas fríos, donde pueden desplegar todo su potencial sin resultar abrumadores. ¿Qué es un eau de parfum? El eau de parfum (EDP) es uno de los formatos más populares por su equilibrio entre duración y precio. Su concentración oscila entre el 15 % y el 20 %, lo que permite una fijación duradera de 6 a 8 horas, dependiendo del tipo de piel y las condiciones ambientales. Marcas como Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Carolina Herrera Good Girl, Montblanc Signature o los perfumes Aeropostale en su versión EDP son buenos ejemplos de esta categoría. Estas fragancias son ideales para el uso diario en ambientes cerrados o para quienes desean un aroma que permanezca durante toda la jornada. ¿Qué es un eau de toilette? El eau de toilette (EDT) contiene entre un 5 % y un 15 % de aceites aromáticos. Esto la convierte en una opción más ligera, con una duración que va de 3 a 5 horas. Es perfecta para climas cálidos, momentos casuales o como fragancia de reaplicación a lo largo del día. Algunos EDT populares son CK One, Versace Pour Femme Dylan Blue, Tous Touch o Light Blue de Dolce & Gabbana en su versión ligera. Son recomendables para quienes prefieren aromas sutiles y frescos que no invadan el espacio personal. Aplicaciones prácticas según el estilo de vida Cada formato responde a un tipo de uso diferente, según la ocasión y la rutina personal. Fragancias para el trabajo y el día a día Para entornos laborales o actividades cotidianas, el eau de toilette suele ser la mejor elección. Su ligereza evita que el aroma resulte molesto para los demás, y su frescura aporta una sensación de limpieza. También es común reaplicar este tipo de fragancia a lo largo del día sin saturar. Marcas como Zara, Burberry Weekend, Benetton Colors, o los perfumes Aeropostale presentan opciones adecuadas para este perfil de uso, especialmente en oficinas o ambientes escolares. Fragancias para eventos especiales Cuando se necesita una fragancia más notoria y duradera, como en bodas, cenas o reuniones nocturnas, lo ideal es optar por un perfume o un buen eau de parfum. Estas versiones logran mayor permanencia y proyección, creando una estela más distintiva. Algunas recomendaciones incluyen Lancome La Vie Est Belle, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Mugler Alien o Elie Saab Le Parfum. Estos productos se comportan bien en pieles secas o en climas templados. Cómo identificar el tipo de concentración Es clave revisar la etiqueta y los detalles del envase antes de comprar una fragancia. Qué buscar en la botella o caja Los productos suelen indicar claramente si se trata de un perfume, eau de parfum o eau de toilette. Estas leyendas aparecen junto al nombre de la fragancia, por lo general en francés. En caso de duda, también se puede consultar el porcentaje de concentración en la lista de ingredientes. Además, algunas marcas ofrecen el mismo aroma en diferentes concentraciones. Por ejemplo, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle tiene versiones tanto EDP cómo EDT, cada una con una estructura olfativa ligeramente distinta, pero fiel al ADN del perfume. Consideraciones al comprar en línea Cuando se adquiere una fragancia por internet, especialmente en tiendas mexicanas como Liverpool, Sears, Sanborns o Amazon México, es fundamental verificar la descripción del producto....","SPR_COMBO[es]Somos referencia obligada en Tlaxcala.

L'incident, révélé après que Vogue a profilé la somptueuse garde-robe de la mariée, a été confirmée par la suite par le -, qui a rapporté que Sánchez a décrit la robe comme «celle qui s'est échappée» et ne sait toujours pas où elle s'est terminée. Une garde-robe faite pour un mariage d'une semaine L'ancien ancre de télévision et pilote d'hélicoptère a commandé 27 robes pour les célébrations de mariage, qui se sont déroulées sur plusieurs jours fin juin sur l'île de Majorque. Bien que le couple s'est officiellement marié lors d'une cérémonie privée à bord de 394 millions de livres sterling de Bezos (500 millions de dollars) Yacht Koru, les festivités ont duré plusieurs emplacements et thèmes. Sánchez aurait travaillé avec des maisons de mode de renommée mondiale, notamment Dolce & Gabbana, Dior, Valentino et Schiaparelli. Chaque look a été conçu pour correspondre à une partie spécifique de la célébration, des dîners avant le mariage aux rassemblements de yachts post-cérémonie. Mais malgré une planification méticuleuse, l'une des robes n'est jamais arrivée. La robe manquante a disparu en transit. Bien que Sánchez n'ait pas identifié le designer, elle l'a appelé «un mystère» et a dit: «Peut-être que ce n'était pas censé être». L'absence n'a pas fait dérailler les célébrations mais a ajouté une tournure inattendue à ce qui était autrement une affaire étroitement chorégraphiée. Une liste d'invités et un budget pour correspondre Le mariage, qui a eu lieu le week-end du 22 juin 2025, était tout sauf petit. Le coût global aurait dépassé 15,7 millions de livres sterling (20 millions de dollars), couvrant tout, de la restauration de luxe au transport et à la sécurité des jets privés. Les invités comprenaient un who's who de la célébrité et de la royauté du monde technologique. Barbra Streisand, Oprah Winfrey, Kris Jenner et Bill Gates auraient tous été présents. Les participants ont été transportés entre les événements via l'hélicoptère, les convois de SUV privés et la flotte personnelle de Bezos. Le couple a loué un domaine du XVIe siècle dans les montagnes de Deià et a accueilli plusieurs rassemblements en plus de la cérémonie elle-même. Les installations florales, les menus sur mesure et la vaisselle des concepteurs auraient fait partie de l'expérience. Malgré sa taille, Sánchez a décrit le mariage dans son interview Vogue comme «intime et sacrée», une phrase qui a attiré des réactions mitigées en ligne. Une robe de mariée devient un sujet de discussion La nouvelle de la robe manquante, bien que mineure dans le contexte d'un événement aussi massif, est rapidement devenue symbolique de l'échelle et de l'excès entourant la célébration. La garde-robe de 27-durée de Sánchez, combinée à la liste des invités somptueuses et à un cadre exotique, a été considéré par certains comme emblématique de l'extravagance milliardaire. Les commentaires en ligne allaient de l'envie légère aux critiques plus nettes. Certains utilisateurs de médias sociaux ont décrit la situation comme un «problème milliardaire à laquelle personne d'autre ne pouvait se rapporter», tandis que d'autres se sont concentrés sur la logistique du stockage et du transport d'un nombre aussi élevé de robes de couture pour un week-end. Sánchez, cependant, semblait imperturbable. Sa citation, «Peut-être que ce n'était pas censé être», livrée en riant, semblait résumer son attitude: élégante mais non botrée. Un mariage fait pour se souvenir Qu'il s'agisse du cadre de superyacht, de la garde-robe rotative ou de la robe de designer manquante, le mariage Bezos – Sánchez a déjà cimenté sa place dans les titres culturels de 2025.

1lr893b,"  Hey everyone! Just wanted to take a moment to thank this amazing community, you've all helped me so much over the past few months. The passion, knowledge, and honest feedback here really guided me through my fragrance journey. In the last 4 months, I went all in tried over 150+ decants, visited a few local perfumeries, and explored and owned tons of perfume oils beyond what I'm sharing in this post. After a lot of research (and a bit of obsession), I ended up collecting these fragrances, and let's just say… it became quite the addiction! That said, I've decided to hit pause and not buy any more fragrances for the rest of the year (with one exception that might arrive in the next couple of days). I'll still be around and happy to help anyone here however I can. Thanks again for being such a great part of this journey! **Note**: I am not an expert , I trust my nose more than reviews, please do research or test fragrances before you buy, I am from Middle east / Asia English is not my native language, I apologize in advance for any mistakes i try to explain this in my words without using any AI or correction tool. I am reviewing all fragrances after giving them time to mature. From Top Left to Right: 1. **Icon by Dunhill**: Really Good citrusy, Aromatic and floral scent. A good alternative for those who don't like sweet or overly citrusy scents for summer. 2. **1 Million Prive:** The most complimented one on my list, absolutely amazing winter scent with sweet and tobacco notes; I failed to find anything that can beat that fragrance. 3. **1 Million Elixir:** Very sweet and creamy vanilla with colorful floral tones, especially on the dry down. Lasts a long time and projection is strong. **4. **   **Jasoor:** Clone of VUBIR Coral Fantasy Long Lasting with Good projection, Very Versatile for year-round wear except very hot evenings. **5. **   **Asad Bourbon:** Clone that covers VUBIR Intense, Most Wanted and Stronger with you. Smells cozy and rich. Feels confident and warm. **6. **   **Khamrah :** Amazing Scent, Sweet,  Warm , Cozy with Vanilla and amber. 7. **Khamrah Dukhan:** I tried Liquid Burn, and to my nose, it smells quite similar that same warm, spicy DNA. But Khamrah Dukhan was much cheaper, so I went for it. It's incredibly long-lasting and feels like a spicier, less sweet version of Khamrah. If the sweetness in the original Khamrah isn't your thing, this might be a better fit. Honestly, it's underrated and didn't get the recognition it deserves from early buyers or reviewers. This one needs more attention, it's a hidden gem. 8. **Alpine Homme Sport**: Clone of Allure Homme Sport, as a Sporty scent both last 4-5 hours, and it's enough for a sports session, very good gym scent. 9. **CDN Precieux:** Clone of Aventus Absolu with Twist, Great performance and quality scent better and smoother when compared with Supremacy CE but costs more and feel more expensive **10. ** **Mont Blanc Starwalker:** absolute masterpiece a good night time / bedtime scent. Calming and relaxing, Hyped for a reason very unique scent. **11. ** **Dunhill Desire for a man:** Apple, Citrus and Rose based scent, classic cheap summer scent suitable for any age. 12. **L'Homme by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of L'Homme Lacoste, long lasting, sweet, citrusy fresh scent. FD is a small local perfumery in my area. 13. **L'Homme Intense by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of Dior Homme Intense, Dior Homme intense clones were mostly sold out and its hard to get them in my country so i visited a local perfumery where they had this clone its using same french oils used by other clone houses. I tried it it was very long lasting so i bought the bottle, during testing it last 12+ hours on my skin. 14....","Hey everyone!

mov_9433D0C7388B6DF27BE7BD401114AF99,"  We took a deep dive into murky online beauty markets to find out what's being sold, how they are being sold, and why so many people are buying them What happens when you live in India with no cousins abroad and a desperate craving for Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip treatment? Or when you're obsessed with the quirky monster doll, Labubu, that everyone on social media seems to own? For some, the answer is simple: don't buy it. But for others - especially those stubborn, brand-loving souls - Indian markets have found a workaround. If you can't get the first copy, just buy the fifth one. And no, these aren't dupes with witty name changes or altered packaging. These are full-blown counterfeits: same branding, identical packaging, but at a mere fraction of the price. We took a deep dive into these murky online markets to find out what's being sold, how they are being sold, and more importantly, why so many people are buying them. But before we unpack all that, let's rewind a bit. The Rise Of India's Counterfeit Culture Counterfeit goods aren't new in India. They've existed in various forms for decades. When globalisation opened the floodgates to international brands, a majority of Indians found themselves unable to afford the real thing. The demand was high, but supply (at least the genuine kind) was out of reach. Naturally, the market responded in its own cheeky way. Think of places like D'manoj Pizza knocking off Domino's. Even when Domino's caught wind of the viral video of their doppelganger, their response was just as cheeky: ""Yahan ka address milega? (Can we get the address?)"" (Not a copyright claim) Today, that spirit has spilled across industries, from fast food to fashion to beauty. Markets like Sarojini Nagar in Delhi, Esplanade in Kolkata and Linking Road in Mumbai are prime examples, brimming with off-brand versions of luxury items. These IRL knock-offs often tweak a letter here, a logo there, or at least get the shade of lipstick slightly off. For beauty products though, the compromises run deeper - especially when it comes to ingredients and safety. But the game has changed online. Unlike the local bazaar, where, you know you're buying a knock-off, e-commerce marketplaces and social media are now peddling products that look identical to the original. Meesho, Facebook Marketplace, Amazon, Instagram... everyone is on it, and everyone is in on it. How These Fake Markets Operate Meesho Meesho is notorious (and simultaneously beloved) for offering bargain-basement prices. The brand claims this is possible because it eliminates middlemen, connects resellers directly to manufacturers, and focuses on lesser-known brands. But this has created the perfect breeding ground for fake products - especially viral beauty items. Take Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip treatment, for instance. Not officially available in India, but somehow being sold on Meesho for less than Rs 500. We even found fake Dior and Gisou lip oils, sold in nearly identical packaging but with slightly altered names. Facebook Marketplace It might not be trending in urban Gen Z circles, but Facebook Marketplace (FMP) is still massive. With over a billion global users shopping every month, it's a hotspot for everything from houseplants to handbags - and now, counterfeit beauty products in India. It's not just about fake luxury either. Some sellers offer bizarrely cheap prices for products that shouldn't even be in India, let alone available at that price. The sheer scale of the platform makes it easy for scamsters to thrive with little scrutiny. Instagram Instagram, Meta's glamorous baby, has become a thriving hub for small business sellers, even in India. Unfortunately, many of them are hawking knock-off makeup and skincare products via Reels. Some don't even bother to change the names-they rely on flashy visuals and discounted prices to hook unsuspecting users. The perfume industry is especially saturated with counterfeit sellers offering half-price on these bottles that may look legit but aren't even close.

In total, Dior achieved more than a billion views on social media, thanks to a communication campaign across 21 platforms in the run-up and aftermath of the June 27 display during men's fashion week in Paris. “The livestream of the show alone attracted over 200 million views, as did the two teaser videos featuring world football champion Kylian Mbappé,” according to Dior, sharing preliminary data with WWD. The full-court press around the show commenced with Andy Warhol's Polaroid of artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. Dior revealed the campaign first via an Instagram Story Close Friends activation, leaking the images to select editors and talents — whom Dior added to the Close Friends feature on Instagram. Before the show, whose opening look was a take on the Bar jacket paired with voluminously pleated cargo shorts, Dior broadcast a film depicting “The White Lotus” actor Sam Nivola in Versailles and guests — including Robert Pattinson — getting ready in their hotel rooms before arriving at the venue. As additional content, Dior released a podcast with Karen Binns and an audiobook based on the founding couturier's autobiography “Christian Dior et Moi,” read in French by Louis Garrel, who also attended the show.

Този впечатляващ модел е вдъхновен от визията на София Лорен в култовия филм ""Houseboat"" от 1958 г., където тя се омъжва за Кари Грант. Роклята на Санчес впечатли с дълги ръкави, корсетен силует, висока яка и типична „русалка“ пола. Отпред бяха зашити 180 копчета – стилно подчертаване на уникалния дизайн.

In a notice posted on its website, Louis Vuitton Korea informed customers that a third-party entity temporarily accessed the company's systems on June 8 and leaked some customer information, reports Yonhap news agency. The company said it learnt of the incident on Wednesday. The compromised data may include customer names, contact details and additional information provided by customers, Louis Vuitton said, but stressed that no financial data, such as passwords and credit card numbers, was affected. The incident is the latest in a string of high-profile data leaks in the luxury sector in South Korea this year.

Cartier notified customers last month about a separate incident involving leaked personal information. 'Must It', a popular luxury goods e-commerce platform in South Korea, also reported two hacking attempts, coming in May and June. The company warned that user data, including names, gender and dates of birth, may have been stolen. Meanwhile, the South Korean government said on Friday it will fine SK Telecom Co. for belatedly reporting a data breach affecting all 25 million users and ordered it to waive customer cancellation fees, wrapping up its two-month probe into one of the worst data leak cases in the country's history. SK Telecom belatedly reported the breach in April, in which universal subscriber identity module (USIM) data was potentially leaked during an unidentified cyberattack on its servers.

The coat, which was part of Jonathan Anderson's debut collection as the creative director for both menswear and womenswear at Dior, featured traditional Indian Mukaish embroidery. Despite its heritage and craftsmanship, Anderson has reportedly failed to acknowledge these artisans' contributions. Craftsmanship details Coat made by 12 artisans over 34 days Fashion commentator Hanan Besnovic aka ideservecouture on Instagram highlighted why the coat was so expensive. The coat, unveiled at Paris Fashion Week on June 27, was made by 12 artisans over a period of 34 days.

Според италианското издание ""Кориере дела Сера"", тоалет от впечатляващата сватбена колекция на Санчес липсва. Макар сред местните да се шушука, че роклята може да е открадната, до момента няма подаден сигнал или започнато разследване по случая. Все още не е ясно коя точно от зашеметяващите рокли на Санчес се е „изпарила“, но според ""Дейли Мейл"" най-ценната ѝ рокля – уникалната дантелена Dolce & Gabbana, с която тя мина под венчило, е в безопасност. Този впечатляващ модел е вдъхновен от визията на София Лорен в култовия филм ""Houseboat"" от 1958 г., където тя се омъжва за Кари Грант. Роклята на Санчес впечатли с дълги ръкави, корсетен силует, висока яка и типична „русалка“ пола. Отпред бяха зашити 180 копчета – стилно подчертаване на уникалния дизайн. ""Първоначално исках нещо модерно, изчистено и секси, а накрая се спрях на тоалет, който носи духа на момента и показва къде съм днес. Аз съм различна жена от тази преди пет години“, сподели новата госпожа Безос пред Vogue. ""Това е голяма промяна спрямо очакванията – обикновено нося рокли с открити рамене или с дълбоки деколтета“, допълва 55-годишната бивша телевизионна водеща.

mov_85B88F3879C3CC38867E972D4AA36CAD,"  Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb - without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries, working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand - one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow, or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets it as a gown, be happy. One would be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires, but it has only two global consumer brands. Having a large home market - by volume, not value - our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts - a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation is the weakest form of 'sui-generis protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products', in Journal of Intellectual Property Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness, and accountability - pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous statutory drafting, sloppy marketing and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations to spur the ages- old artisanship and economically uplift kolhapuri makers. None of the large Indian business groups - those even in fashion or retail - have come forward yet to safeguard their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled sarees as part of a sustainability project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration of iconic monuments and archaeological sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged' by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia. Delhi-based Scot William Dalrymple has taken India's primordial gift for myth and narrative to make scholarship in history accessible. While the renaissance of modern Indian art owes much to Japanese businessman Masanori Fukuoka. Unless we own, defend and develop our own value chains, we shall continue to let our misplaced chauvinism get the better of us. The devil doesn't just wear Prada.","Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride.

As stated by davidsinclairphd - Scientist/Geneticist/Professor at Harvard University… “Your clock is ticking faster by always being fed.” I've been getting a lot of questions about what my secret is to maintaining youth/fitness, and I'd love to share some info and hope it inspires you. I've been fasting with a time restricted window of eating for many years, long before it was popular. Initially, it started by intuition/ listening to my body. Today, I can humbly say that people tend to presume I'm in my 30's. The reason why this is interesting is because, I'm 52. All I can say is, there is definitely something to this. My lifestyle includes: Never thinking about/using words like “age/old”; I eat 1 meal a day, every 24 hours around 6:30pm and have fruits/veggies/salads/fish/chicken; no carbs-occasionally popcorn; do not eat/drink anything with sugar, gmo's, etc.; no alcohol; never use drugs/no smoking; get 7-8 hours of sleep a night; start the day with water, coffee, stretching/cardio work out/light weights; take vitamins/supplements; This is a commitment. It takes consistency, discipline, self control/holding yourself accountable. If you're starting on this journey, please know it should be gradual and not something to jump into overnight. It has been proven by scientific studies and research to have many health benefits in reprogramming genes/DNA, age reversal, preventing diseases and ultimate fitness.

Ringo Starr says he asked for script changes for the Sam Mendes film project. Four films are planned – one for each Beatle – with Starr played by Barry Keoghan. While pleased now, Starr felt the initial script didn't reflect him or Maureen (his first wife, who died of leukaemia in 1994): “'That's not how we were,' I'd say. ' We would never do that.'” This reminds me of a niggle watching Peter Jackson's Get Back, the 2021 restoration of Michael Lindsay-Hogg's 1970 ﻿documentary, Let It Be. It only clicked on the second viewing: the Beatles' wives have undergone a modicum of deep﻿fakery/airbrushing. The men have, too: in some scenes﻿ Paul McCartney has the shine of a freshly glazed doughnut. But ﻿Linda McCartney and Maureen especially are blandly smoothed﻿ – unnecessarily prettified﻿, veritable Chat GPT versions of themselves. It's perhaps a side-effect of the restoration techniques﻿ but it's still an outrageous liberty, especially when considering the superior reality of Maureen's working-class fizz, and Linda's proto-vintage individualism. It's so nice to learn that Starr wants to see his real﻿ Maureen. We all do. From the band that gave us Paperback Writer to the news that literature is the new arm candy. Dior's incoming creative director, Jonathan Anderson, has launched a series of litera﻿ture-themed tote bags, including: Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs de Mal; Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's Les Liaisons Dangereuses; and Bram Stoker's Dracula, for those with an inner goth.

FA0724F511A32E4DC29B070B1282CCB9,"  Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb — without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries,   working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch   and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand — one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary   topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western   couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow,   or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri   has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets   it as a gown, be happy. One would   be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires,   but it has only two global consumer   brands. Having a large home market — by volume, not value — our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts   — a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation   is the weakest form of 'sui-generis   protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products',   in Journal of Intellectual Property   Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness,   and accountability — pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single   malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous   statutory drafting, sloppy marketing   and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative   zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism   of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace   and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations   to spur the ages old   artisanship and economically   uplift kolhapuri   makers. None of the large Indian business groups — those even in fashion or retail — have come forward yet to safeguard   their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative   process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled   sarees as part of a sustainability   project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration   of iconic monuments and archaeological   sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve   or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged'   by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar   to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia. Delhi-based Scot William Dalrymple has taken India's primordial gift for myth and narrative to make scholarship   in history accessible. While the renaissance of modern Indian art owes much to Japanese businessman Masanori Fukuoka.

It doesn't help that India's GI regulation   is the weakest form of 'sui-generis   protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products',   in Journal of Intellectual Property   Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness,   and accountability — pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single   malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous   statutory drafting, sloppy marketing   and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative   zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism   of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace   and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations   to spur the agesold   artisanship and economically   uplift kolhapuri   makers. None of the large Indian business groups — those even in fashion or retail — have come forward yet to safeguard   their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative   process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled   sarees as part of a sustainability   project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration   of iconic monuments and archaeological   sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve   or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged'   by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar   to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia.

While the renaissance of modern Indian art owes much to Japanese businessman Masanori Fukuoka. Unless we own, defend and develop our own value chains, we shall continue   to let our misplaced chauvinism get the better of us. The devil doesn't just wear Prada. arijit.barman@timesofindia.com","Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb — without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries, working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand — one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow, or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets it as a gown, be happy. One would be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires, but it has only two global consumer brands. Having a large home market — by volume, not value — our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts — a net $90 bn deficit.

midu_cacf77f133f5e2e2b2036f13785ee950,"  SPR_COMBO[zh]提到奢侈品，你是不是立刻想到这些名字👇
Louis Vuitton、Chanel、Dior、Cartier、Hermès、YSL、Givenchy……
有没有发现，它们几乎都来自——法国‼️
这些品牌，构成了魅力法兰西🇫🇷的标志。 👑 一切从“太阳王”路易十四开始…
法国的奢侈品文化并非偶然，而是从王权时代就被“刻进DNA”。 17世纪，路易十四一边打造凡尔赛宫🌟，一边成立了皇家制造厂，让镜子这种奢侈品开始国产化。 奢侈品从王公贵族的宫廷生活延伸至工艺品、香水、家具🪑与时装👗，奠定了法国“时尚与奢华”的国家品牌。 为什么法国能称霸奢侈品界？ 🧐
这不是偶然，是一场“国家级的精心策划”：
1⃣ 历史文化传承：早在路易十四时代，奢华就已渗透进法国文化
2⃣ 政府全力扶持：法国政府长期为奢侈时尚行业提供资金、打击假货、保护品牌
3⃣ 手工艺精神：传承工坊文化，注重细节与品质
4⃣本地化营销：如在中国市场，会推出中式节日限定款
5⃣ 营造稀缺性：通过限量发售、候补名单营造“买不到”的高端感
6⃣银幕上的加持与文化影响：从赫本到梦露，明星效应强化法国品牌影响力✨
7⃣高端生活方式打造：不只是衣服包包，更是一种“精致的生活方式”
🫅强大的奢侈品集团
就像美国有科技四巨头 GAFA（Google、Amazon、Facebook、Apple）
法国也有自己的奢侈品四巨头——KHOL：
▪️Kering开云集团：旗下有Gucci、YSL、Balenciaga、BV等。 ▪️Hermès爱马仕：独立但实力强劲，球最难买的品牌之一，以手工工艺闻名。 ▪️L'Oréal欧莱雅：美妆界的王者，旗下包含Lancôme、YSL Beauty、Kiehl's等
▪️LVMH路威酩轩：涵盖Louis Vuitton、Dior、Celine、Fendi等80+品品牌。 这些集团凭借并购➕品牌矩阵➕高端战略，牢牢掌控全球市场话语权。 法国奢侈品，是艺术、工艺、身份与文化的集合。 不是一只包，而是一个故事📖
不是一瓶香水，而是一段传承💫

n1k5oym,"  Emmy is on my permanent shit list because of this incident. Sorry if it's a bit long… Back in 2010/2011 I was still in college and interning part time at a fashion PR agency. Basically in our office we also had a showroom with designer gowns, shoes, jewelry, etc of all the fashion brands that we represented. We represented anything from high end brands like Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, and Jimmy Choo, all the way down to smaller brands like Nicole Miller. The way it worked is that these gowns, etc would be rented out to celebrities to wear at red carpet events (or any big event where they'd be photographed). 90% of the time the stylists of these people would come in on their own, grab a bunch of items, and then return them after the event was done. However, every so often a celebrity would come in with them to pick out the pieces. One thing I should mention that's important to the story is that for the super luxury brands, we would only rent them out to super A list people (people like Angelina Jolie, Halle Berry, etc). For anyone B list or below we would only allow them to rent mid-size or smaller brands. This particular day, Emmy had come in with her stylist. Her stylist called us a head of time and demanded that we close off the show room to them only…. we don't usually do this, but we did it any ways. I was also told by my boss that Emmy was one of those people who didn't allow people to look at her or speak to her directly. The day Emmy and her stylist came in was a busy day for the actual publicists so I was instructed to help them pick out clothing. They also told me which designer dresses to not allow her to borrow. So Emmy and her stylist come in and while they're selecting items, I'm taking the inventory down. Emmy then gets to the Christian Dior rack and sees a dress she loves. Unfortunately that's one of the designers I'm not supposed to allow her to rent from. I let her stylist know this who then told Emmy. Emmy then starts throwing a full blown temper tantrum and starts yelling at me to the point where both my manager and the owner of the agency come out to calm her down. We then have to lie to her and say that this particular dress is already on hold for someone else. They ended up leaving with the other rented items, but after this the owner of an agency made it a rule that no celebrities are allowed to come in with their stylists. Usually stylists know which designers their clients can and can't wear, and banning clients from the office prevents a lot of drama.","Emmy is on my permanent shit list because of this incident.

A cada edição, o que vemos é uma verdadeira passarela a céu aberto, onde a movimentação do público revela mais do que tendências: mostra como identidade, memória e desejo se cruzam na construção do vestir. Em 2025, o que se destaca é a pluralidade. Se antes havia uma separação nítida entre o que era “moda da cidade” e o “estilo do sertão”, hoje esses limites estão cada vez mais borrados — e é aí que mora a riqueza. O streetwear dialoga com o forró raiz, o boho abraça o country, o artesanal invade o urbano. A moda no Cariri não copia: ela reinventa. E o resultado são looks autorais, criativos, e muitas vezes mais relevantes do que os que vemos nas grandes passarelas. Neste momento da temporada fashion, as lojas varejistas do Cariri já começam a lançar suas Coleções Expocrato . Enquanto influenciadores digitais promovem marcas e produtos que, muitas vezes, não refletem a realidade ou o estilo do público que frequenta o evento, os consumidores saem em busca de visuais que combinem com o clima da festa — sem abrir mão do custo-benefício.

E ela não está sozinha: artistas como Lil Nas X, Dua Lipa e Post Malone também embarcaram nessa vibe western , misturando tradição e modernidade nos palcos e videoclipes. A tendência ultrapassou o universo musical e chegou às telas.

That being so, the whole faux pax can be attributed to the usual arrogance and “what can they do?” mentality of state governors!

This is to let you know that I follow and appreciate your column avidly. Besides, this intervention is to set the records straight as quotes and data from your writings become veritable sources of history tomorrow. In your piece on “Revisiting Akeredolu's cenotaph of controversy”, you dwelt extensively on the first cement block house in Owo. To be precise and correct, the first cement block house in Owo was built by Chief S. B. Aruwajoye in 1947 at No 9, Owaluwa Square, Owo. It was not necessarily the first two-storey building in the town but was popular because of the novel fancy block of its external walls. Chief Alabi's house at Igboroko Street, definitely an architectural masterpiece of its time, came later in the early 1950s. I did not point this fact out earlier because it would have been distracting to the issues being discussed at the time. – Akin Aruwajoye. Why not just remove the Memorial symbol where the names of the victims and the epitaph are placed to another agreeable location and remodel the place to a relaxation public park, instead of demolition and obvious waste of public funds? Anyway, it is not their money! Tunji Alapini (Police AIG rtd.) . Nothing settles this dangerous matter better than this your article! – Durotimi Adeboye. Black is a colour that nobody wears in Buckingham Palace. Princess Diana's first sin was that when she went on her first official shopping, after her engagement to then Prince Charles, she bought a very beautiful black Christian Dior dress! l think that's the culture all over the world. Royalty and or royal eyes do not behold death. If not, “bawo ni irukere fi maa gbo”? Our late “Great lfe” friend, Arakurin Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu, and his wife were too haughty for their own eternal good. – Chris Abugo. Thanks for your submission! – Damola Oshodi. The big question is: Why not dismantle the building? The answer is: Not much can be salvaged when you try to dismantle a house. If you chisel the wall, the pressure will break the glasses. Not much could have been salvaged. Regardless, our former governor made a terrible mistake in the first instance by building the cenotaph on Omasan street. His intention was to demolish virtually all the buildings on that stretch, including my father's house (Chief Aruwaji). Ogwa had to let him know that the building on that stretch includes the building owned by Olagbegi and Aruwaji families. Ologho as per tradition dances around Ogho during Igogo festival and he stops by to pay homage to the memories of the two respective families....","What a cenotaph! And what a controversy!

Besides, this intervention is to set the records straight as quotes and data from your writings become veritable sources of history tomorrow. In your piece on “Revisiting Akeredolu's cenotaph of controversy”, you dwelt extensively on the first cement block house in Owo. To be precise and correct, the first cement block house in Owo was built by Chief S. B. Aruwajoye in 1947 at No 9, Owaluwa Square, Owo. It was not necessarily the first two-storey building in the town but was popular because of the novel fancy block of its external walls. Chief Alabi's house at Igboroko Street, definitely an architectural masterpiece of its time, came later in the early 1950s. I did not point this fact out earlier because it would have been distracting to the issues being discussed at the time. – Akin Aruwajoye. Why not just remove the Memorial symbol where the names of the victims and the epitaph are placed to another agreeable location and remodel the place to a relaxation public park, instead of demolition and obvious waste of public funds? Anyway, it is not their money! Tunji Alapini (Police AIG rtd.) . Nothing settles this dangerous matter better than this your article! – Durotimi Adeboye. Black is a colour that nobody wears in Buckingham Palace. Princess Diana's first sin was that when she went on her first official shopping, after her engagement to then Prince Charles, she bought a very beautiful black Christian Dior dress! l think that's the culture all over the world. Royalty and or royal eyes do not behold death. If not, “bawo ni irukere fi maa gbo”? Our late “Great lfe” friend, Arakurin Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu, and his wife were too haughty for their own eternal good. – Chris Abugo. Thanks for your submission! – Damola Oshodi. The big question is: Why not dismantle the building? The answer is: Not much can be salvaged when you try to dismantle a house. If you chisel the wall, the pressure will break the glasses. Not much could have been salvaged. Regardless, our former governor made a terrible mistake in the first instance by building the cenotaph on Omasan street. His intention was to demolish virtually all the buildings on that stretch, including my father's house (Chief Aruwaji). Ogwa had to let him know that the building on that stretch includes the building owned by Olagbegi and Aruwaji families. Ologho as per tradition dances around Ogho during Igogo festival and he stops by to pay homage to the memories of the two respective families....",2025-07-06 11:41:44,en,WEB,,,,,False,1,False,False,,,The provided text appears to be a lengthy commentary about a cenotaph controversy and does not contain any substantive discussion about Dior fragrances or counterfeit products.

As she prepares to welcome her third child with A$AP Rocky, the Fenty founder and Smurfs star is getting a whole lot of love, support, and late-night snack deliveries from her partner of five years. According to People, the couple is “thrilled” to be growing their family again, and sources close to the pair say this pregnancy feels different — softer, slower, and somehow even more full of love. “He's completely tuned into her needs,” the insider shared of Rocky, who's been “incredibly attentive and nurturing” as Rihanna rests and gets ready for baby no. 3. Related story Rihanna's Baby Bump Is on Full Display at the Met Gala After Revealing Her 3rd Pregnancy While some dads might think diaper duty earns them a gold star, Rocky's in full-service mode.

It marked her third major pregnancy reveal in as many years, following her viral 2023 Super Bowl moment and her first pregnancy announcement in 2022, when she wore a $29K outfit in a paparazzi photo, per Us Weekly. Still, this time seems more intimate. Back in December, Rihanna joked that the only thing she hadn't achieved yet was having a daughter. “I'm batting at 75 percent for a boy next time,” she told E! News. “So, we'll just keep our fingers crossed.” And in April, she doubled down: “I would try for my girl,” she told Interview. “But of course, if it's another boy, it's another boy.” Either way, Rocky's right there next to her. Even if he doesn't help dress the kids — “That's their mother by herself,” he admitted last year — he still plays muse. “Sometimes she dresses them like me… kilts and all of that,” he said.

mov_FA10516A319DB03D07F3AFB2F190FE99,"  Alexa Chung has revealed that she' selling some of her most iconic looks, seen on runways and Glastonbury fields alike, on Vinted for an endometriosis charity that's ""close to my womb"" English model and TV presenter, Alexa Chung has confirmed she will be selling her clothes on Vinted, telling fans on TikTok proceeds will be going to a cause ""very close to my womb"". The 41-year-old revealed earlier this year that she had underwent surgery for endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, which can potentially lead to infertility and other complications. Alexa was diagnosed with the condition in July 2020, calling her experience in getting treatment ""frustrating"" while services were ""under-funded"". In April 2025, the Popworld presenter confirmed her first Vinted sale drop, in which she flogged items from her own wardrobe in order to raise money for Endometriosis UK, prompting millennial hysteria.

The 41-year-old revealed earlier this year that she had underwent surgery for endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, which can potentially lead to infertility and other complications. Alexa was diagnosed with the condition in July 2020, calling her experience in getting treatment ""frustrating"" while services were ""under-funded"". In April 2025, the Popworld presenter confirmed her first Vinted sale drop, in which she flogged items from her own wardrobe in order to raise money for Endometriosis UK, prompting millennial hysteria. She has since taken part in other drops, with the latest confirmed in the video she shared to TikTok on Wednesday (July 2).

mov_93FF9F17A8A0288BB817116B811230E4,"  Rihanna recently headed for Paris to attend Men's Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2026, which included a stop at the AWGE (a.k.a. the label founded by her partner, A$AP Rocky) and Dior shows. For the artist, every appearance is an excuse to adorn herself with beautiful pieces. But a fashion show? That's when she takes her jewelry to a whole other level. Rihanna has worn a lot of extraordinary pieces over the years, but we couldn't take our eyes off the pearl and cameo necklace that served as a centerpiece for her look at Dior. As usual, Rihanna is proving that she's aware—and always a step ahead–of the latest trends. Whether they're mounted as pendants or set in a romantic ring, cameos are back in fashion. Cut from resin and tinged with a baroque touch, the old-fashioned jewelry trend is seeing a new life on and off the catwalk. To pay witness to the first collection by Jonathan Anderson, newly appointed head of Dior's men's collections, the star adorned herself in the jewelry classic by wearing a Marlo Laz pearl choker. The three-row necklace features a central cameo haloed by diamonds and a baroque pearl. Rihanna also wore two cameo rings by Lydia Courteille dated from the 19th century. Cameos are an art form in which an image is carved in relief on a precious or semi-precious stone, often composed of several layers of different colors. The fact that it's back on trend feels rooted in the “bygone glamour” phenomenon currently hitting the fashion cycle—that is, a return to vintage looks driven by nostalgia for past decades. Pearls, signet rings, and now cameos are now being dusted off and reimagined by designers like Jesse Marlo Lazowski, the founder of Marlo Laz, and fashion insiders a la Rihanna. Inspired?

I've been to events before, but this one felt... different. Intimate. Magical. Deeply cultural. Have you ever walked into a room and felt like you were stepping into someone's fairytale? Phones Down, Glam On Before entering the venue, we were asked to seal our phones in small plastic pouches — no cameras, no social media, no distractions. At first, I felt the reflex to reach for my phone, to capture something, anything... but then I realized: maybe this night isn't meant to be captured. Maybe it's meant to be lived. Would you be okay giving up your phone for the night if it meant being fully present? An Entrance Fit for a Queen To the right: a mini salon for touch-ups. To the left: a coffee bar with Arabic blends and Turkish tea. And everywhere in between: fresh flowers, oversized mirrors, and perfume stations filled with Chanel, Dior, and elegant oud blends that lingered in the air like poetry. Before stepping into the event hall, we were in abayas. But just before entering, we gracefully took them off, revealing our evening gowns — each one more stunning than the next. Mine was a sparkly silver piece, but honestly? Every woman in that room looked like art. A Celebration of Femininity and Tradition We greeted one another cheek to cheek, guided to our table by the bride's sister. Even the servers wore pressed uniforms, gracefully pouring endless cups of karak and herbal tea. Everything was intentional — from the Narumi bone china plates to the floral centerpieces that stood tall like sculptures. And the food? Think creamy hummus, beef stew, chicken biryani, sambusa, and more. But more than taste, it was the energy of being surrounded by women in full bloom — confident, graceful, glowing — that truly fed my soul. Have you ever felt beauty in a room so strongly, it didn't need to be said out loud? Then She Walked In... The bride entered like a vision — her dress glittering like stardust, her pace soft and steady. Romantic music filled the room. Big screens framed her walk to the stage. She looked like she belonged in a fairytale, but one grounded in heritage and pride. There was a collective pause, a silent awe — the kind you don't interrupt. A Shift in Energy Later, we were asked to wear our abayas again — the groom and his family were about to arrive. The vibe shifted: a little more formal, a little more sacred. I watched as he gazed at the bride, visibly in love. And though no photos were allowed, that moment will live in my memory far longer than anything I could've posted. What This Night Taught Me It reminded me that sometimes, the most beautiful moments are the ones we don't capture. That elegance isn't about extravagance — it's about intention. And that when women come together in celebration, something powerful happens. Would you say yes to attending a wedding like this if invited? Would you leave your phone behind and trust the moment to hold itself? Let's Talk: Have you ever experienced a wedding that made you feel something this deeply?

Demna, known for his daring work as well as controversies during his decade-long stint at Kering-owned Balenciaga, will unveil his final collection on Wednesday in what is expected to be one of the highlights of the week. Not to be confused with Paris Fashion Week, Haute Couture Week takes place exclusively in Paris — in January for spring-summer collections and July for autumn-winter. It is a uniquely French event dedicated to handcrafted, one-of-a-kind creations made to wear at red carpets, galas, and other high-profile events. The 44-year-old Demna, acclaimed by millennials and Gen-Z stars from Kim Kardashian to British pop sensation Charli XCX, has been tasked with reviving the flagging fortunes of Gucci by Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault. After multiplying sales at Balenciaga, where he made headlines with a $2,000 ""Ikea"" bag and a $1,800 so-called ""trash pouch"", he is currently being honoured with an exhibition titled ""Balenciaga by Demna"" at Kering's Paris headquarters. He will be succeeded by Italian designer Pierpaolo Piccioli, who is set to present his first collection in October during Paris Women's Fashion Week. As usual, Schiaparelli will open Couture Week, followed later in the day by shows from Iris Van Herpen —- returning after a year-long break -— as well as Georges Hobeika, Imane Ayissi, Rahul Mishra, Julie de Libran, and Giambattista Valli. After Demna's farewell on Wednesday, Belgian designer Glenn Martens will find himself in the spotlight as he unveils a first collection for Maison Margiela following his appointment in January to succeed British designer John Galliano. American designer Michael Rider, who succeeded Hedi Slimane as chief designer at Celine, unveiled his first collection for the luxury French brand on Sunday, outside the official calendar. – Absences – On Tuesday, Chanel will present the final collection created by its in-house design studio, the fifth since Virginie Viard's sudden departure in June 2024. More in Style Her successor, the discreet and highly respected Franco-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy, was appointed in December and will showcase his first collection for Chanel in October. Up to Thursday, 27 houses will unveil their creations, including Elie Saab, Armani Prive, Aelis, Viktor&Rolf, Adeline Andre, and Dubai-based Rami Al Ali who is set to become the first Syrian to join the official calendar. Following a spate of major changes at fashion houses, some absences will stand out, particularly Dior's. After a highly anticipated debut during the men's Fashion Week on June 27, newly appointed artistic director Jonathan Anderson is holding back his first haute couture collection for January 2026. Named in early June to lead Dior's women's and couture lines as well, the 40-year-old Northern Irishman has become the first person since founder Christian Dior himself to oversee all three branches of the house. Jean Paul Gaultier is also missing. Dutch designer Duran Lantink, appointed as the brand's permanent artistic director in April, will make his debut during Women's Fashion Week in October. Since stepping back in 2020, Jean Paul Gaultier has handed over the reins of his couture collections to a series of guest designers, including Olivier Rousteing, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, Haider Ackermann, and Simone Rocha.

Her summer style has been a masterclass in on-trend elegance, and she's relied on the dresses, hats, shoes and jewellery already in her wardrobe. Yet the 43-year-old's look has subtly changed in other ways.

The court in Milan ordered a one-year administration for Loro Piana Spa, according to a 26-page ruling reviewed by Reuters, in the latest in a string of cases that have tainted the image of Italy's luxury brands. The administration will be lifted earlier if the company brings its practices into line with legal requirements. The court said Loro Piana Spa ""culpably failed"" to adequately oversee its suppliers in order to pursue higher profits. Loro Piana could not immediately be reached for comment. LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, acquired 80 percent of Loro Piana in July 2013, leaving 20 percent in the hands of the Italian family that founded the company. Loro Piana is the fifth fashion company to be targeted by the same Milan court over similar labour issues since December 2023, following Italian fashion group Valentino, an Italian unit of LVMH's Dior, Italy's Armani, and Alviero Martini, an Italian handbag company.

As a king the shorter you are the less powerful you are in the eyes of others. In order to get respect he asked the royal Shoemaker to create a shoe that makes him taller in order to get the respect he deserves. Now that is one Story. Fact tho is that the High Heel itself doesn't have just one inventor but is smth that has developed throughout hundreds of years.

These blushes are packed with just the right hint of warmth that wakes up your whole face, giving you that post-vacation glow without leaving home. So, read on to meet your new favorites. Saie Dew Blush In “Spicy”  Amazon   If you want that just-back-from-the-beach color without UV regrets, “Spicy” delivers.

Milani Baked Blush In “Luminoso”  Amazon   Budget-friendly but performance-packed, Luminoso delivers a sun-warmed peach tone infused with light-catching mica. Makeup fans call it the ultimate high-end dupe. TikTok revived its fame, pushing this around $10 product into cult status again, particularly among users seeking a glow without shimmer overload. Benefit Cosmetics “Sunny” Willa Blush  Amazon   Glowing, not glittery, Willa gives a soft golden-rose hue that builds with ease. It's ideal for everyday wear. On fair skin tones, this blendable blush doubles as a subtle contour, making it more versatile than expected. Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush In “Joy”  Amazon   Bright coral in a single dot, Joy transforms dull cheeks into radiant ones in seconds. Fans love the dewy finish and insane pigment payoff.

MAC Sheertone Blush In “Peaches”  Amazon   Makeup artists don't retire Peaches for a good reason. This satin blush avoids shimmer but still delivers a glow. Known for its skin-like finish, it complements mature complexions without highlighting texture. Even decades later, it remains an award-winning and professional staple shade. Tower 28 BeachPlease Blush Balm In “Golden Hour”  Amazon   Inspired by sunset light in LA, Golden Hour brings a vibrant orange-peach tint to cheeks and lips.

mov_BAABFC754377580B79B5BCA2D755EF30,"  Rihanna put an elegant twist on lingerie styling and added exaggerated proportions to her Saint Laurent look for the premiere of the animated film “Smurfs” in Los Angeles on Sunday. The Savage x Fenty founder attended the premiere alongside her sons, three-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and two-year-old Riot Rose Mayers, both of whom wore Dior Men suits. Rihanna was wearing a look from Saint Laurent's fall 2025 ready-to-wear collection, which debuted during Paris Fashion Week last March. The Grammy Award-winning artist's attire featured a black dress with lacy, lingerie-inspired detailing at the bust. The lace detailing transitioned into a silky smooth fabric. The look featured a drop-waist element to accentuate the singer's baby bump, which she debuted at the 2025 Met Gala last May. The drop waist was further defined with a deep olive green sash and a voluminous skirt. Rihanna paired the dress with a retro leather bomber jacket. Her hair was styled into an updo, complemented by soft makeup, including a pink lip, to complete her look. Rihanna's look was designed by Saint Laurent's creative director Anthony Vaccarello. “The fall collection packed a wallop with its rich palette; sophisticated color combinations immediately recognizable as YSL, like ochre-khaki or orange-purple; commanding shoulders, and a low-slung waistline which tied a neat bow on the '80s trend that's been percolating through Paris,” Miles Socha wrote in WWD's review of the collection. Rihanna's sons, both of whom she shares with partner A$AP Rocky, were styled in pieces by Dior Men. Rihanna's look was curated by stylist Jahleel Weaver. “Smurfs,” directed by Chris Miller and based on the popular 1960s cartoon, follows Smurfette, voiced by Rihanna, as she leads the Smurfs in rescuing Papa Smurf from the evil wizards Razamel and Gargamel. The film hits theaters Friday.

On Sunday, July 13, the singer brought her two sons, RZA, 3 and Riot, 23 months, for a special night out at the Smurfs premiere in Los Angeles. While the evening was a celebration of Rihanna's new acting gig — she voices Smurfette in the animated film — it also turned into a runway show once the trio stepped onto the carpet. The 37-year-old Fenty Beauty founder, who is expecting her third child with A$AP Rocky, made a statement in a bump-baring Saint Laurent Fall 2025 gown with lace cups, a full skirt and an olive green ribbon cinching her waist.

Riot wore a custom toddler's version of one of Anderson's ensembles that featured a green single-breasted jacket, a white shirt with a matching bow tie and flared white shorts.

A Milan Court has put Loro Piana into a judicial administration procedure concerning alleged worker exploitation in the Italian luxury brand's supply chain. Loro Piana in a statement on Monday evening said it “acknowledges the notification received from the Court of Milan's Preventive Measure Section today regarding labor practices by undisclosed and unauthorized subcontractors of one of its suppliers.” The Italian luxury company stated that “in breach of its legal and contractual obligations, the supplier did not inform Loro Piana of the existence of these subcontractors. Loro Piana was made aware of this situation on May 20, and, as a result, the maison terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours.” Furthermore, “Loro Piana firmly condemns any illegal practices and reaffirms its unwavering commitment to upholding human rights and compliance with all applicable regulations throughout its supply chain. Loro Piana is committed to ensuring that all its suppliers comply with the maison's highest quality and ethical standards in line with its Code of Conduct. In this perspective, Loro Piana has been constantly reviewing and will continue to strengthen its control and audit activities.” According to media reports, Loro Piana sells cashmere jackets with a price tag of 3,000 euros, which, through its subcontractors, would allegedly actually cost only 100 euros. The firm denied this claim. “The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier, nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.” Looking ahead, Loro Piana concluded by stating that it “expresses its full willingness to cooperate with the relevant authorities on this matter and intends to provide the utmost support for any further investigations.” Loro Piana is controlled by the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and is helmed by chief executive officer Frédéric Arnault, who succeeded Damian Bertrand last month. Bertrand is now chairman of the brand and has moved to become deputy CEO of Louis Vuitton. This is only the latest luxury brand to incur in such a probe. Dior, also part of LVMH, and the Giorgio Armani Group have also been investigated for allegedly using suppliers who subjected workers to poor conditions, including inadequate wages, and potentially misleading consumers about their commitment to ethical standards, labor practices and artisanal production. Both brands have seen the judicial administration procedures lifted after taking steps to improve their supply chain and labor practices. In February, a Milan court ordered the revocation of the judicial administration imposed since April last year on Giorgio Armani Operations, a unit of the namesake designer's fashion group, over the labor practices of its Chinese-owned subcontractors. At the time, the Armani Group said in a statement that the decision to revoke the judicial administration was made because the company has taken all the necessary corrective action and “already had a structured and tested system of controls and protection of its supply chain.” The revocation came ahead of the one-year deadline initially expected, it pointed out. The statement underscored that the decision was also made because the court recognized the group's craftsmanship as Armani's suppliers “are often to be identified as highly qualified artisans, especially regarding Italian production, characterized by the highest level of sophistication and quality.” Last year, judges also placed an Italian subsidiary of Dior, which produced handbags for the French brand, under the same form of special administration, again for lack of control over its supply chain. In May, the French fashion house was cleared of any wrongdoing and said it remains “committed to upholding our values of transparency and respect throughout our supply chain. This further underscores the maison's steadfast and historic dedication to pursuing both rigorous Made in Italy products and the highest standards of ethics and excellence.” Alviero Martini was also investigated over alleged worker exploitation, and in May, a unit of Valentino specialized in bags was placed under judicial administration for a year by the Milan court after worker abuse was uncovered at subcontractors. Following the move, Valentino said it had intensified its supplier evaluation process across its supply chain in recent years and would cooperate with the relevant authorities to “fully understand the circumstances that have led to the measures taken by the judiciary in this specific case.”","Referring to ""undisclosed and unauthorized subcontractors of one of its suppliers,"" the Italian luxury company stated that ""in breach of its legal and contractual obligations, the supplier did not inform Loro Piana of the existence of these subcontractors.""

mov_72986CA310AC3B29CFD8ABD43F4EE16C,"  The biggest airport serving Italy's fashion capital of Milan has strengthened its high-end retail offer by introducing French heavyweights Dior and Louis Vuitton to anchor its luxury line-up with the largest boutiques at the gateway. Milan Malpensa Airport—which handled almost 30 million passengers last year, up 11%—is continuing its strategy of establishing itself as a premier European destination for high-end shopping. The operator, SEA Milan Airports, which also runs the smaller airport of Milan Linate, is stepping up its luxury offer in line with the city's rising popularity as a place to shop tax-free. According to tax refund specialist Global Blue, between December 2024 and February 2025), Milan accounted for 9% of total tax-free sales in Continental Europe with an average spend of €2,240 ($2,615), bettered only by Paris with a 22% share and average spending of €2,660 ($3,105). Both the Dior and Louis Vuitton boutiques are directly operated by the brands and have significant footprints at about 4,800 and 6,100 square feet, respectively. They take the number of luxury brands at Malpensa to 22, not including various corners and pop-ups within Avolta's large duty-free stores at the airport. The two new arrivals are strategically located in one of the most prominent areas of Terminal 1, and their eye-catching storefronts are now the first to be seen by passengers as they exit the security area into the retail spaces. Other big-name boutiques in T1 include Armani, Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Bulgari, Damiani, Hermès, Ferragamo, Moncler, Tod's and Zegna, many of them centered around a Davide Oldani Cafè. Luigi Battuello, chief commercial officer of SEA, commented: “With the arrival of Dior and Louis Vuitton, Malpensa cements its status as a benchmark for premium airport shopping. The investment by these iconic brands reflects our vision of an increasingly international, modern gateway—credible to partners and attentive to the needs of global travellers.” Milan lures global luxury shoppers Last year, T1 had the most international passengers of any SEA terminal and/or airports at 30%. European passengers accounted for 21%, North Americans 4%, and North Mediterranean Africa and the Middle East passengers, 2%. Intercontinental air traffic at Malpensa has been growing again and should support Dior and Louis Vuitton, both of which have been expanding at key hub airport like Qatar's Hamad International and others. In the first five months of 2025, luxury sales increased by a solid 18% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by the rise in high-spending international travelers. Average transaction value also rose by more than 9% year-over-year. This builds on an already strong 2024 for luxury, which was up a very healthy 21%. As with most airports in Europe, high-end retail sales drivers are non-European Union passengers, particularly from Asia and the Middle East. They account for over 80% of luxury purchases. T1 is, by far, the strongest terminal for non-EU customers. In 2024, across the SEA network (Malpensa and Linate combined), sales rose by 15% reaching record commercial revenue of €470 million ($550 million). Food and beverage ticked up higher at 16.6%. Malpensa has created a high-end commercial district at the airport, claiming to have a shopping experience “on par” with Milan's downtown Quadrilatero della Moda fashion district, where streets like Via Monte Napoleone are world famous and a magnet for luxury shoppers from all over the world. Global Blue ranks Milan ahead of Florence and Rome as the most strategic destination for international travel shopping in Italy. The fashion capital benefits from Italy's global reputation for fashion and craftsmanship, although this is being tarnished by scrutiny into alleged abuse of workers through subcontracting practices. Loro Piana, an LVMH house known for cashmere items, became the fifth high-end label in Italy to be put under judicial administration following investigations that started in 2023.","The biggest airport serving Italy's fashion capital of Milan has strengthened its high-end retail offer by introducing French heavyweights Dior and Louis Vuitton to anchor its luxury line-up with the largest boutiques at the gateway.

July 15, 2025, 1:05am Macy's may be holding on to its longtime position as the top U.S. retailer by share of fragrance sales, but plenty of other shifts are afoot when it comes to who's winning the category. According to YipitData, Macy's accounted for 31.8 percent of fragrance sales during the month of May, indicating a 14.7-point lead from the category's next-biggest retailer during the period, Ulta Beauty. While significant, that lead is several points less than it was, say, two years prior in 2023, when Macy's accounted for more than 40 percent of fragrance sales during the same month. This shift is in part due to the nascent growth of alternative fragrance retailers as formidable competitors in the space. There's Amazon, which, per YipitData, accounted for 14.9 percent of fragrance sales in May across the platform's first- and third-party sellers (tracking after Sephora, which accounted for 15.5 percent during the same period). TikTok Shop, too, wasn't on the map at all in the U.S. until halfway through 2023, yet today the e-tailer — which has propelled brands from Lattafa to Phlur to virality — goes head-to-head with Target in terms of share of fragrance sales, actually outpacing Target slightly in May. Year-to-date, the top three fragrance brands at Sephora have been Kayali, Sol de Janeiro and YSL Beauty, in that order. For the month of May, Valentino overtook YSL for the number-three spot, while in April, Chanel's Chance Eau Splendide Eau de Parfum was the retailer's top-selling new stock keeping unit across the store. On Amazon, which YipitData reports has gained modest but steady share in fragrance since 2023, winning brands range from value-driven to designer, a dynamic which the platform's top two brands in May — Lattafa and Versace — quintessentially represent. Other top 10 brands on Amazon include Sol de Janeiro, Nautica and Dior (which, like all brands owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, does not officially sell on the platform). So far in 2025, fragrance has been the fastest-growing category in beauty, as has been the case since 2021. According to Circana, the category grew 4 percent in the prestige market and 8 percent in mass during the first quarter of this year.

Driving factors include rising disposable incomes, increased brand consciousness, and a burgeoning middle class in China, India, and Japan. Enhanced digital shopping and travel also boost demand for premium brands. Challenges like counterfeit goods and economic volatility persist. Key sectors include luxury clothing, footwear, and watches. Major players like LVMH and Rolex are leveraging digital platforms and responding to evolving consumer trends to capture growth opportunities in this vibrant market.Dublin, July 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Asia Luxury Goods Market Share Analysis and Size - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Asia Luxury Goods Market is anticipated to see massive growth, increasing from USD 135.25 billion in 2024 to USD 192.17 billion by 2033, with a CACR of 3.98%. The development is driven by increasing disposable income, increased brand consciousness, and an increasing middle-class population in nations like China, India, and Japan. Enhanced digital shopping channels and travel are also increasing the demand for high-end and premium luxury brands in the market. Luxury products command a wide popularity base with strong demand in regions such as Asia, North America, and Europe. In the past few years, new markets such as China, India, and the Middle East have seen growth at a fast rate because of increasing disposable incomes and online luxury consumption. Luxury products are not only consumed for personal use but also as gifts, investments, and collectibles. The shift towards experiential luxury, such as travel and personalized services, also reflects international luxury consumers' evolving tastes. Drivers of Growth in the Asia Luxury Goods Market Rising Middle Class and Disposable Incomes Asia's increasing middle class is fueling the luxury goods industry. With rising disposable income, customers are seeking premium products as symbols of prestige and markers of individual achievement. China and India are witnessing a surge in high-income consumers who value quality and brand prestige highly. This demographic shift is expanding the customer base for luxury products, leading to increased sales and market penetration in the region. Nearly 65% of the middle class will reside in Asia by 2030, approximately 3.5 billion people. Digital Transformation and E-commerce Expansion The rapid rise of digital technologies has reshaped the Asian luxury retail environment. E-commerce sites and social media platforms are now vital marketing channels for brands to engage with consumers, especially younger generations. Online sales of luxury products are on the rise, as brands are spending in digital showrooms, live-streamed experiences, and custom-made digital experiences to drive maximum customer engagement and sales. Lancome, an L'Oreal group, introduced Lancome Happiness Nights initially in 2021 by offering a live-in-experience immersion from its store on Paris's Champs-Elysees. Dior offered access to its VIP July 2022 fashion show and the possibility of discussing 'live' with make-up specialists and getting guidance on beauty tips. Live-shopping will be accounting for about 20% of worldwide online purchases by 2026, McKinsey finds in the wake of a survey. Tourism and Duty-Free Shopping Tourism plays a significant role in driving the Asian luxury market. Japan and South Korea, among other nations, receive tourists who propel luxury sales via duty-free shopping. The appeal of tax-free buys and carefully selected merchandise available at airports and tourist areas boosts luxury sales. Additionally, the restart of international travel as a result of the decline of the pandemic will also propel this segment. For instance, as reported by the industry, duty-free sales in Japan generated USD 450.7 Million in May 2024, where duty-free products totaling around 566,000 purchases were made by shoppers, whose products mainly included high-value duty-free items such as luxury bags and jewelry. Challenges in the Asia Luxury Goods Market Counterfeit Products and Brand Dilution The explosion of counterfeit luxury goods poses a significant risk to brand reputation and consumer trust. Pirated versions, offered at lower prices, devalue brands and deter prospective customers. Luxury brands need to invest in anti-counterfeiting measures, including blockchain technology and authentication services, to protect their reputation and maintain product authenticity. Economic Uncertainty and Market Volatility Economic fluctuations such as currency devaluation and inflation may influence consumer spending on luxury goods. For instance, China's luxury market slowed down in 2024 with reduced domestic spending and increased tourist shopping abroad. Such volatility necessitates luxury brands to be agile, adapting strategies to make them robust during economic downturns. Asia Luxury Clothing and Apparel Market Asia's luxury apparel and clothing segment is growing strongly, fueled by fashion-oriented consumers seeking high-end, designer clothing. Urban lifestyles and exposure to international fashion have influenced behavior, triggering demand for luxury clothing. The response is from companies introducing regional products and collaborations with local designers to address the diversity of tastes in Asian markets.

mov_23EF8CE44131F7DB4C0BF33D6C26E01A,"  Italian fashion house Loro Piana, owned by French giant LVMH, has been placed under court administration for allegedly facilitating the exploitation of workers by subcontractors. In a statement, the carabinieri police said the company had been deemed “incapable of preventing or curbing labour exploitation within the production cycle by failing to implement adequate measures to verify the actual working conditions or the technical capacities of its contractors”. An investigation found the fashion house entrusted the production of its clothing, including cashmere jackets, to a company without production facilities. That firm outsourced the work to another company, which in turn used workshops in Italy employing Chinese workers to save costs, the statement said. In these workshops, irregular workers were exploited without respecting health and safety rules, particularly regarding wages, working hours, breaks and holidays, investigators found. The judges of the Milan court found that Loro Piana “negligently facilitated” the exploitation, according to the police statement. The court however stressed that the one-year administration was intended as “preventative”, not a punishment, according to the court document seen by AFP. It was aimed at “combating the unlawful contamination of healthy businesses by subjecting them to judicial oversight” where they can be removed from “criminal infiltration”. In a statement, Loro Piana said it had terminated ties with its supplier within 24 hours of discovering the existence of its subcontractors on May 20, and was fully cooperating with authorities. “Loro Piana strongly condemns any illegal practices and reaffirms its ongoing commitment to protecting human rights and complying with all applicable regulations throughout its entire supply chain,” it said. The investigation began in May following a complaint from a Chinese worker who claimed he was beaten by his boss after demanding payment of back wages, police said. The police carried out inspections in factories run by Chinese citizens in the area surrounding Milan, finding violations of workplace rules as well as illegally built dormitories and unsanitary conditions. Proceedings were brought against two Chinese nationals who owned workshops, two Italians for violations of workplace health and safety standards, and seven workers without residence permits. The court also imposed fines totalling over 181,000 euros ($211,000) and administrative penalties of around 60,000 euros. The operations of two Chinese workshops were also suspended “for serious safety violations and the use of undeclared labour”, the police statement said. Loro Piana was acquired by LVMH in 2013, and is currently led by Frederic Arnault, son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault. The company did not comment on the proceedings in Milan. The Italian justice system has already carried out similar proceedings against other fashion houses including Armani. In May, the Italian competition authority cleared luxury brand Dior — also owned by LVMH — of violations in working conditions but required it to pay a two-million-euro fine towards “victims of exploitation”.

1m0k6i8,"  While the world was busy with Amazon Prime Day and Flipkart sale(I did end up buying Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Headphones and Logitech G29 Racing Wheel), I decided to pull the trigger on the fragrance which got me into this world - Creed Aventus and added a bunch of others to my ever-growing collection (attaching pics of the new purchases and the overall collection as well) BACKGROUND (Might be a slightly lengthy storytime, I recommend reading through the non-sense but feel free to skip to the review section if you want): I got into fragrances through my flatmate. He had a 200ML Dior Sauvage which I liked. I started researching the top fragrances and found the man, the myth, the legend: Jeremy Fragrance. Creed Aventus was a regular part of his videos and I was always intrigued by it. I managed to get my nose on it in airports and offline stores and loved it, but always found it to be too expensive for what was being offered. That was a time I was big on clones and thought they offer the same value as the 20k niche brands. But as we all experience in our fragrance journeys, there comes a time when the clones start to smell cheap and we start appreciating the quality and nuance we get by paying that extra amount of money for designer or niche fragrances. Soon clones smell alcoholic and synthetic, no matter the brand and that's the stage I'm in, where CDNIN doesn't do the job anymore. The day finally came, when I pulled the trigger on my fragrance journey ever-present aspiration of Creed Aventus and graduated in my fragrance journey finally REVIEW: 1. Creed Aventus (F batch): The smoky pineapple DNA still gets me. Amazing pineapple opening. Projects heavily for the first 4 hours. Drys down to a smoky pineapple smell and lasts 6-8 hours on skin and 12 hours on clothes. Still an amazing compliment puller and an all occasion, all weather scent. Love the smell, got a ton of compliments in office and highly recommend. The quality and finesse of the original cannot be replicated by any of the clones out there and I've tried them all. Still a beast mode fragrance. 10/10 will recommend if you have the budget 2. Kilian Roses on Ice: Have been obsessed with this DNA since a few months. Smells like a fresh cucumber with a gin and tonic touch to it. Super fresh and uplifting. Perfect for summers and monsoon. Again, an expensive fragrance, recommend this only if you have extra money lying around. Projects and lasts like a beast, as expected from a high quality brand like Kilian 3. Fraganote After Shave: All Fraganote fragrances have magnetic caps and amazing bottles with one of the best pressurized atomisers I've seen. I bought this thinking it'll be like Old Spice, and though it shares some similarities, it's still it's own blend. An original creation and not a clone of anything. Proud and amazed by Fraganote for sticking to creating original scents profiles and not succumbing to being a clone house, as most brands tend to do at this price point. Coming to the fragrance, a nice clean barbershop scent, lasts long and projects well. Perfect for office 4. Fraganote Not Just Mango: Super unique, the only Mango fragrance I've ever smelled. That being said, it can be polarizing, smells like a mango ice-cream bar. Lasts long and is only suited for parties where you want to be noticed and stand out for being different 5. Fraganote Pineapple Club: A good pineapple scent. Nothing like Creed Aventus or Hacivat, has its own DNA, and does stand out. Smells like freshly cut pineapple but the note is very subtle, and smells super fresh. Can be a good office scent All Fraganote fragrances lasted well and projected well. Again, I understand the financial decision of fragrance houses operating in this price range to stick to clones and smells you know will work, saving R&D costs and turning a profit at fraction of the original price. Extremely bold for Fraganote to create their own fragrances at 1200 per 50 ML price and experiment. Hope they keep doing this and bring unique scents to our noses","While the world was busy with Amazon Prime Day and Flipkart sale(I did end up buying Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Headphones and Logitech G29 Racing Wheel), I decided to pull the trigger on the fragrance which got me into this world - Creed Aventus and added a bunch of others to my ever-growing collection (attaching pics of the new purchases and the overall collection as well) BACKGROUND (Might be a slightly lengthy storytime, I recommend reading through the non-sense but feel free to skip to the review section if you want): I got into fragrances through my flatmate.

The day finally came, when I pulled the trigger on my fragrance journey ever-present aspiration of Creed Aventus and graduated in my fragrance journey finally REVIEW: 1. Creed Aventus (F batch): The smoky pineapple DNA still gets me. Amazing pineapple opening. Projects heavily for the first 4 hours. Drys down to a smoky pineapple smell and lasts 6-8 hours on skin and 12 hours on clothes. Still an amazing compliment puller and an all occasion, all weather scent. Love the smell, got a ton of compliments in office and highly recommend. The quality and finesse of the original cannot be replicated by any of the clones out there and I've tried them all. Still a beast mode fragrance. 10/10 will recommend if you have the budget 2. Kilian Roses on Ice: Have been obsessed with this DNA since a few months. Smells like a fresh cucumber with a gin and tonic touch to it. Super fresh and uplifting. Perfect for summers and monsoon. Again, an expensive fragrance, recommend this only if you have extra money lying around. Projects and lasts like a beast, as expected from a high quality brand like Kilian 3. Fraganote After Shave: All Fraganote fragrances have magnetic caps and amazing bottles with one of the best pressurized atomisers I've seen. I bought this thinking it'll be like Old Spice, and though it shares some similarities, it's still it's own blend. An original creation and not a clone of anything. Proud and amazed by Fraganote for sticking to creating original scents profiles and not succumbing to being a clone house, as most brands tend to do at this price point. Coming to the fragrance, a nice clean barbershop scent, lasts long and projects well. Perfect for office 4. Fraganote Not Just Mango: Super unique, the only Mango fragrance I've ever smelled. That being said, it can be polarizing, smells like a mango ice-cream bar. Lasts long and is only suited for parties where you want to be noticed and stand out for being different 5. Fraganote Pineapple Club: A good pineapple scent. Nothing like Creed Aventus or Hacivat, has its own DNA, and does stand out. Smells like freshly cut pineapple but the note is very subtle, and smells super fresh. Can be a good office scent All Fraganote fragrances lasted well and projected well. Again, I understand the financial decision of fragrance houses operating in this price range to stick to clones and smells you know will work, saving R&D costs and turning a profit at fraction of the original price. Extremely bold for Fraganote to create their own fragrances at 1200 per 50 ML price and experiment. Hope they keep doing this and bring unique scents to our noses",2025-07-15 15:04:50,en,REDDIT,,,,,False,1,False,False,,,"The comment is a detailed personal review of fragrance purchases, including Dior Sauvage and other brands.

mov_A4B1FF7CC0C5A3DFB57B35B953D8FC83,"  The 2025 MLB All-Star festivities are upon us, with the sport's biggest stars descending on Atlanta this week. Before the AL and NL All-Stars got into uniform for Tuesday night's game, the players and their families arrived in style on the red carpet. Who was best-dressed and who missed the mark? Yahoo Sports breaks it all down below: Ronald Acuña Jr. is as reliable as they come on the All-Star red carpet. As the video below calls out, he's put together some incredible looks over the years, and this year was no different. As usual, the bling was blinding, with Acuña sporting a circular Atlanta-themed pendant he said he designed himself. I wasn't familiar with your game, Tarik Skubal. The AL starting pitcher brought high fashion to the carpet in an all-black look featuring Dior, Valentino and Jil Sander. The chains and sunglasses complete the cool, effortless vibe. Skubal may not have known what he was wearing, but whoever is dressing him, keep it up. We see you, Aaron Judge! The Yankees star naturally incorporated pinstripes into his look, rocking a sleek summer-vibe suit paired with leather boots in a combination that just works. His wife, Samantha, complements the look with her cream-colored peplum detail minidress. Continuing with the summer-white theme, Yoshinobu Yamamoto channeled Hollywood glam with this sharp, formal look. The details, from the tie accessory to the watch, are on point. Yankees star Jazz Chisholm Jr. always shows out, and this year was no different as he sported a very on-trend belted suit jacket, plus a set of brooches. The flower chains on his pants and wrist add a touch of fun to the look. Also on the brooch train was Max Fried, whose textured jacket, baggy pants and sneakers struck the right effortlessly chic tone. Fernando Tatis Jr. is always willing to take a fashion risk, and it paid off with this white jacket, flared pants and black boot combo. The no-shirt look, complete with the necklace, just works. What's in Pete Alonso's bag? He didn't say, but the Fauré Le Page tote was a chic accessory, and the slugger wins points for knowing his fashion history. The All-Star red carpet brings MLB families together, and we have to acknowledge the Lindors, whose looks complement each other well without being too matchy. Francisco Lindor's detailed jacket paired with laid-back jeans makes for a cool-casual look. Edwin Díaz and his family showed out in matching green suits, and you just have to appreciate the commitment to the uniform. Not only did the Marte family coordinate, but their sleeveless blue, belted suits are top-tier. We do have questions about D. Baxter the Bobcat's look, however. Shohei Ohtani has had some top-tier fashion moments in the past, highlighted by his forest-green suit at the 2022 All-Star Game. But even the best player in the game will swing and miss, and that's what happened at this year's red carpet. Ohtani's look on Tuesday was ill-fitting and disjointed, but his wife, Mamiko, picked up the slack in a very apropos peach-colored dress. Clayton Kershaw notched his 3,003rd career strikeout last week, but unfortunately for him, he struck out on the red carpet with this dull, mismatched look. We're not sure sleeveless is the way to go, but a little risk-taking couldn't hurt. Despite being near the bottom, Paul Skenes does win some points for wearing a local Pittsburgh designer, David Allen, and for his funny retort to girlfriend Livvy Dunne's comment about his fashion. But his mauve suit with the robin-egg blue accents misses the mark a bit. Cal Raleigh is on top of the baseball world right now after his Home Run Derby win on Monday night, so we won't bring him down too much, but his navy suit just leaves a bit to be desired. We give Raleigh props for owning his ""dad swag,"" though. Kudos to the Rodón family for their coordination, but Carlos Rodón's suit is ... a lot.

Clayton Kershaw notched his 3,003rd career strikeout last week, but unfortunately for him, he struck out on the red carpet with this dull, mismatched look. We're not sure sleeveless is the way to go, but a little risk-taking couldn't hurt. Despite being near the bottom, Paul Skenes does win some points for wearing a local Pittsburgh designer, David Allen, and for his funny retort to girlfriend Livvy Dunne's comment about his fashion. But his mauve suit with the robin-egg blue accents misses the mark a bit. Cal Raleigh is on top of the baseball world right now after his Home Run Derby win on Monday night, so we won't bring him down too much, but his navy suit just leaves a bit to be desired. We give Raleigh props for owning his ""dad swag,"" though. Kudos to the Rodón family for their coordination, but Carlos Rodón's suit is ... a lot.

1. DIOR - 迪奥恒久裸感光采蜜粉饼
(Dior Forever Nude Radiant Filter)
这是我最喜欢的粉饼了。 上脸不卡粉，还有细腻的珠光粒子，让皮肤看起来特别好看。 价格虽然有点高，但真的物有所值！ 2. CHANEL - 香奈儿米色亮采轻盈蜜粉饼
(Le Beige Luminous Color Sheer Powder)

1. BANILA CO - Prime Primer定妆散粉
粉质非常细腻，能一颗颗填满毛孔，修饰效果特别好。 上脸后皮肤变得特别柔滑，不会内干，还能很好地定妆！ 比起粉扑，更推荐用刷子上妆。 2. ABOUT TONE - 柔焦蜜粉饼
性价比超高的一款粉饼！ 韩国人里应该有一半以上都在用这款。 上脸非常轻薄，还能很好地修饰肤色！ 是四款里最没有负担、最日常的一款！ #定妆粉 #韩国化妆品 #韩国美妆 #混油皮 #香奈儿散粉 #迪奥散粉 #banilaco散粉 #韩国旅游 #abouttone散粉 #皮肤管理",SPR_COMBO[zh]我是偏干性皮肤，但夏天妆容很容易脱妆，所以我一定会在妆容最后一步用定妆粉！ 这次来分享我正在用的四款定妆粉。 百货专柜产品 1.

1m1k8uf,"  ## Fashion Roundup: July 16, 2025 The fashion world on July 16, 2025, offered a blend of glamour, cultural preservation, and the ever-present influence of celebrity collaborations. From the opulence of Bollywood costume design to the stylish convergence of global icons, the day's news highlights the evolving landscape of style. **Bollywood's Extravagant Costumes: A Celebration of Heritage** One of the key narratives emerging from the day's fashion news centers on the artistry and expense behind Bollywood film costumes. The industry's dedication to creating visually stunning and historically accurate wardrobes was showcased, moving beyond mere fashion and delving into cultural preservation and cinematic storytelling. Film productions are increasingly investing heavily in costume design, recognizing its critical role in immersing audiences in the narrative and enhancing the overall cinematic experience. The article specifically highlighted some of the most iconic and expensive costumes in Bollywood history. The red bridal lehenga worn by Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the film *Jodhaa Akbar* stands out as a significant example. The lehenga, a testament to India's rich textile heritage, has achieved global recognition, finding a permanent place in fashion history and recently being added to the Academy Museum's ""Colour in Motion"" exhibition. This underscores the growing recognition of Bollywood costumes as works of art and cultural artifacts, solidifying their place in fashion's legacy. This development demonstrates the growing importance of costume design and its recognition as a critical element of film success, while also promoting cultural heritage through the lens of fashion. **Celebrity Collaborations and Style Crossovers:** Another significant trend shaping the fashion news cycle on July 16th was the ongoing influence of celebrity endorsements and style crossovers. The convergence of global icons, in particular, drove significant attention, demonstrating how celebrities can influence trends on social media platforms. The announcement of a collaboration between Formula 1 legend Lewis Hamilton and BTS member Jimin sparked considerable excitement within their combined fanbases. Hamilton's subtle acknowledgement of Jimin wearing an outfit from his Dior menswear collection on Instagram Stories was enough to ignite the internet. The post, accompanied by a handshake emoji and the simple caption ""my @dior collection (sic),"" immediately sent waves of enthusiasm through both ARMY (BTS fans) and motorsport enthusiasts. This demonstrates the power of celebrity endorsements and the potential for individual style choices to influence and drive trends across different spheres of culture. This type of engagement illustrates how social media has become a critical platform for showcasing fashion and solidifying celebrity style, showcasing the significance of brand collaboration within the industry. **Fashion Journalism and Current Trends:** The day's fashion news was rounded out by the ongoing efforts of the fashion journalism landscape. A subscription-based newsletter, ""Fashion Statement,"" offered a curated overview of current trends, commentary, and solutions to wardrobe dilemmas. This newsletter showcases the need for journalists to compile information for their readers. The newsletter and fashion journalism, in general, provides context, insight, and analysis of the fashion industry, which assists its readers in navigating the complexities of the world of style. **Key Takeaways:** The fashion news of July 16, 2025, provides several key takeaways for fashion enthusiasts and industry observers alike. First and foremost, it highlights the significance of integrating cultural and historical contexts into fashion. The inclusion of the *Jodhaa Akbar* lehenga in the Academy Museum's exhibition underscores the importance of preserving heritage and celebrating the artistry of costume design. Secondly, the story reflects the increasing power of celebrity influence, highlighting the crucial role of collaborations and endorsements in shaping trends. The convergence of Lewis Hamilton and Jimin demonstrates how celebrity personalities and brands can be leveraged to reach wider audiences. This continues to grow the importance of social media as a means of communication and trendsetting within the fashion space. Finally, the news summarizes the ongoing evolution of fashion journalism in providing the consumer with reliable and easy-to-digest information to help make the trends more accessible for everyone. In conclusion, the fashion landscape on July 16th, 2025, presented a multifaceted view, demonstrating a strong appreciation for artistry, cultural heritage, and the ever-present influence of celebrity culture, all of which will continue to shape the industry for years to come.

And seriously, I'd love to get your take on it, so please drop your feedback in the comments.

mov_057C48B10872CD48C228586C820DDDBA,"  Season three of The Summer I Turned Pretty kicks off on Wednesday. The night before three of the top cast members, whose characters are in a love triangle on the weepy teen saga, talked to The Tonight Show about which one will end up with beauty Isabel 'Belly' Conklin. The stars of the hit show are Lola Tung (as Belly), Gavin Casalegno (who plays Jeremiah) and Christopher Briney (who stars as brooding hunk Conrad). 'Season 2 ended with a major cliffhanger. This was a big deal. I mean, your character, Belly, chose Jeremiah over Conrad,' Jimmy Fallon said  before asking Tung what she thought about that ending. 'I'm all for her following her heart,' the actress shared as she said she was 'Team Belly.' Belly was careful to not give any secretive plot details away. She continued: 'And she's doing what she needs to do in the moment, and following her heart in that moment and in every moment.' In a snippet shared during the show, viewers see Belly watching Jeremiah play Twister when Conrad calls him. Jeremiah asks Belly to answer and she and Conrad have an awkward exchange. When asked about Season 3, Tung said, 'I think it's a lot more of the emotional rollercoaster you're used to, I guess, and also, you know, there's a little time jump, so we meet the characters in a little bit of a more mature place, I think.' Season three takes place four years after season two ended. While on The Tonight Show Tung wore a John Galliano for Dior corset dress from a 2001 collection, along with a pair of 2013 Dior Mary Jane pumps as she accessorized with Panconesi earrings. In a trailer for the show's third and final season, Conrad is seen asking Belly's best friend Taylor (played by Rain Spencer) for advice about his plan to come back into Belly's life. It's clear he is ready to win her over again. The first two episodes of season 3 of The Summer I Turned Pretty will premiere on Prime Video on Wednesday, July 16. Season three will consist of 10 episodes. The program, which had viewers crying hard enough to give themselves migraines, has become one of Amazon Prime Video's most popular shows. Amazon and MGM Studios' head of television, Vernon Sanders, issued a statement to elaborate on the success of the coming-of-age series. 'We've been delighted to see the passion with which fans have embraced The Summer I Turned Pretty, making Summer Fridays an entertainment phenomenon,' he said. Sanders went on to speak about how The Summer I Turned Pretty, which was created by Jenny Han, had quickly become a fan-favorite program. 'This charming, deeply heartfelt series has shown the breadth of our customer base, appealing to a young, diverse set of viewers. Jenny Han is a gifted storyteller, whose fans have been clamoring for the third chapter of this story,' he stated. The Summer I Turned Pretty is based on Han's book of the same name, which was originally released in 2009. The book was followed up by a pair of sequels that were published in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The series is centered on Isabel 'Belly' Conklin, a teenage girl who ends up in a love triangle with a pair of brothers.","Season three of The Summer I Turned Pretty kicks off on Wednesday.

44DF2738300840B12C56DCAB4CD23D30,"  Appearances at Wimbledon and a French state visit symbolize a new kind of style. Earlier this year, when Catherine, the Princess of Wales, returned to the public eye after her treatment for cancer, The Sunday Times of London reported that she was doing so with a caveat: She wanted to focus on her work, not her clothes. Her office would no longer share information about what she wore. Cue shock and horror. Even if it was understandable, given what she had been through, and even if the report was later disputed by the palace itself, it sent tremors through the fashion-watching community. That was partly because the princess could change the fortunes of a designer or a brand simply by wearing a dress. And it was partly because she had long used her place in the attention economy to shine a light not just on British products, but on issues like sustainability by remaking and rewearing pieces from her closet, and even renting the occasional evening gown. Mostly, though, it was because the clothes are an expression of her role as a symbol -- of the country and that fine line between continuity and modernization. Stepping back from one suggested she was stepping back from the other. It's a weird thing to essentially be an avatar, but it's the job. As her appearance at the Wimbledon men's and women's finals, and at the French state visit, demonstrated, however, Catherine may be more selective about her appearances (she did skip Ascot), but she is no less strategic. She is simply being Catherine 3.0. There she was, after all, at the state visit, welcoming Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron in a blush-colored Dior suit with a New Look jacket and a skirt covered in net, just brushing her calves. The brand is both classic French and about to be led by a designer from Northern Ireland who was trained in Britain. It was a considered nod to political alliance (the kind she has practiced since marrying Prince William) that she repeated at the French state banquet, wearing a red Givenchy gown with a built-in cape sweeping down from her shoulders. It was regal, sure, but also strategic, given that Givenchy is now designed by Sarah Burton, the British designer who made Catherine's wedding gown and who has been her collaborator on numerous high-profile public occasions. Talk about entente. And there Catherine was at the Wimbledon women's final in a cream jacket and long pleated skirt, a coolly appropriate riff on tennis whites and her position as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club. So, too, the royal blue ankle-length Roksanda dress she wore to the men's final was perfectly coordinated with Prince William's blue blazer, Prince George's blue suit and Princess Charlotte's white dress trimmed in blue, all creating a literal picture of family unity. All demonstrating that Catherine is as attuned as ever to the role image-making plays in her job. That's not new. What is new, however, is the style in which she is doing it, and its consistency. Her skirts have gotten longer, her jackets more tailored, her silhouette more streamlined. The effect of dropping her hemlines even a few inches is both oddly nostalgic and sophisticated, gently protective. A reminder that she is dressing for the long game. Like the lanky pantsuits she had adopted for her everyday appearances, her style is shaping up as a new formula for dressing. As recognizable, in its own way, as the monochrome formula that served Queen Elizabeth II so well: shoes-to-coat-to-dress-to-hat in one shade. And it brings a new dimension to the symbolism inherent in Catherine's role. She is representing not just the next generation of the royal family, which itself represents tradition. She is representing the idea of elegance emerging from adversity, an idea that has both micro and macro associations. Who couldn't use some of that right about now?","Appearances at Wimbledon and a French state visit symbolize a new kind of style.

The former Playboy Bunny looked nearly ageless as she strutted in a floral bikini top, paired with tiny white bottoms and a sheer maxi skirt in Saint Tropez, France. In new photos obtained by TMZ , Silvstedt was seen arriving at the iconic Club 55 along the blue waters of the French Riviera. Wearing oversized white sunglasses, the Swedish star smiled in nearly every shot as walked along the boardwalk. According to her Instagram Story, Silvstedt is in town for a Dior event. She posted a video of herself sunbathing on a boat before heading to the exclusive designer dinner. Later that evening, she shared glimpses of the candlelight meal with other notable guests. Silvstedt first gained international fame in 1993 when she was crowned Miss Sweden. She later skyrocketed to stardom after being named Playboy's Playmate of the Year in 1997. In addition to her modeling success — including being a Guess? spokesmodel and walking the runway for high-fashion labels like Chanel, Giorgio Armani and Valentino — Silvstedt also dabbled into music. Her debut album Girl on the Run featured the lead single “Hello Hey,” which peaked at No. 7 on the Swedish Singles Chart. While she began modeling decades ago, Silvstedt has maintained her youthful appearance and continues to impress fans with her toned figure. She's been open about the routines that help her stay in shape over the years. "" I do yoga and I run, but I swear I lose more weight shaking my booty at parties,"" she once admitted in an interview . In another sit down , she revealed her go-to activities, including, ""power walks, Pilates and tennis” — so basically any sport. ""My routine has definitely become more disciplined with time! I take plenty of supplements like collagen, and I add vegan protein, chia, and flax seeds to my diet,"" she said of her diet.

mov_1480FE2F66456D821BEA3DE7B6C837E6,"  Quick Answer Who makes Dior jewellery? Dior's high jewellery is designed and crafted in France, but not all of the brand's jewellery is made there. For special collections and intricate handwork, Dior collaborates with skilled artisans all over the world, including India. Costume jewellery and components may be produced or assembled elsewhere, including in China. The Illusion of 100% “Made in France” Luxury brands like Dior sell more than jewellery; they sell an image. “Made in France” suggests artisans working in light-filled Parisian workshops, hand-setting diamonds in silence. And while that's partly true for Dior's Haute Joaillerie line, it's far from the whole picture. Today's luxury industry runs on global production. To keep up with demand, and to access the best traditional craftsmanship, Dior, like many luxury maisons, relies on a mix of in-house ateliers and long-standing external partners across continents. Read – Jewellery Trends for 2025 – From Fashion to High Jewellery Dior's Mumbai Collection: A Testament to Indian Artistry One of the most visible acknowledgements of Dior's global sourcing came with the Fall 2023 Mumbai Collection. The show, staged in front of the Gateway of India, celebrated the deep creative friendship between Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior's former artistic director, and Karishma Swali, director of Chanakya ateliers and the Chanakya School of Craft. For over two decades, Chanakya has produced exquisite hand-embroidery, textile art, and jewellery detailing for Dior's most intricate pieces. In the Mumbai Collection, Indian artisans weren't behind the scenes—they were the stars. The show featured: Jewellery and embroidery entirely handmade in India Craft rooted in centuries-old techniques, passed down through generations A spotlight on female empowerment through Chanakya's work with women artisans This collaboration is a counter-narrative to the typical outsourcing story. It's not about cutting costs; it's about preserving vanishing traditions and elevating them on a global stage. Who Makes Dior Jewellery—Really? Let's break it down: Type of JewelleryWhere It's MadeHaute Joaillerie (Fine Jewellery)Designed and crafted in Paris, often with French-sourced gemsSpecial collaborations (e.g. Mumbai Collection)Handcrafted in India, especially at Chanakya ateliersCostume jewelleryOften assembled in Europe, with components possibly sourced from China or Thailand At the helm of Dior's jewellery design is Victoire de Castellane, the long-time Artistic Director of Dior Joaillerie. Known for her bold, storytelling-rich aesthetic, Castellane has transformed the house's jewellery into miniature fairy tales of colour, movement, and meaning. Interestingly, she's also the sister of Mathilde Favier, the influential Head of PR Worldwide at Dior Couture, a dynamic sibling duo shaping both the image and the sparkle of the Dior universe. India's Historic Role in Jewellery Making India isn't new to high jewellery; in fact, it's where the world once looked for it. For centuries, India was a global centre for gemstone trade, diamond cutting, and gold craftsmanship. The Mughal Empire left behind a legacy of lavish, intricate jewels combining Persian, Hindu, and Islamic artistry. British royalty, including Queen Elizabeth II, received gifts of jewellery from Indian maharajas, such as the legendary Hyderabad Necklace, a diamond masterpiece that remains one of the Queen's most famous pieces. Today, cities like Jaipur and Surat continue this legacy, the latter being home to 90% of the world's diamond cutting and polishing. So when Dior entrusts Indian ateliers like Chanakya with delicate embroidery and jewellery-making, it's not outsourcing, it's recognising generations of skill and prestige. China's Role: The Fast-Paced Side of Luxury China, on the other hand, plays a different role. It's more commonly used in costume jewellery production: Mass manufacturing Moulding and casting of metal components Enamelling, stone setting, or assembly for seasonal accessories While this allows brands like Dior to release more affordable, trendy lines, it also raises questions about: Labour conditions Wage disparity Transparency in the lower tiers of the supply chain These are the aspects luxury brands often omit from their glossy marketing materials.

It does not necessarily reflect the view of The Herald. Indie rockers Wet Leg have seen their second album go to number one, the Official Charts Company said. Their offering – moisturizer – tops the Official Albums Chart, the Official Vinyl Albums Chart, and the Official Record Store Chart as the biggest seller of the past week in UK independent record shops. It replicates the success of their eponymously-titled debut album, which also topped charts on its release in 2022. Meanwhile, Oasis continue to dominate the album charts as they play their reunion gigs in the UK. The Gallagher brothers, along with the rest of the band, have three albums from their back catalogue in the top five – with Time Flies… 1994-2009, (What's The Story) Morning Glory? and Definitely Maybe. The Oasis Live '25 Tour kicked off in Cardiff at the beginning of July, and they are now part-way through a five-show run in Manchester. Sandwiched between Oasis is American singer Justin Bieber, with his seventh top 10 album – SWAG – debuting at number four with its digital release. Also in the top 10 is Burna Boy, who banks his fifth UK top 10 album with No Sign Of Weakness at number six. Scottish singer Amy Macdonald lands her sixth top 10 album with Is This What You've Been Waiting For? at number eight, while fellow Scot Barry Can't Swim achieves his first-ever top 10 – with second studio album Loner at number 10 And global superstar Sir Elton John surpasses 400 weeks on the Official Albums Chart with his 2017-released greatest hits collection Diamonds. The album, which hit number one for the first time in January, has now spent an impressive 401 weeks inside the top 100. On the singles charts, producer MK, known as Marc Kinchen, spends a second week at number one with Dior featuring singer-songwriter Chrystal. Dior is also the most streamed track in the UK this week, racking up 5.5 million streams over the past seven days. US singer Sabrina Carpenter holds steady in second with her former chart-topper Manchild, while Calvin Harris and Clementine Douglas's Blessings jumps three spots to a new peak of number three. Bieber also bags the highest new entry of the week with DAISIES in fourth place. Netflix musical movie KPop Demon Hunters yields its first top 10 hit with its album of the same name, leaping 11 places to number nine. Meanwhile, Olivia Dean's Nice To Each Other soars four spots to a new peak of number 10, becoming the London singer-songwriter's second top 10 song, following Sam Fender duet Rein Me In.","Wet Leg perform on stage at the TRNSMT festival in Glasgow (PA) This article is brought to you by our exclusive subscriber partnership with our sister title USA Today, and has been written by our American colleagues.

mov_503981BBB338F350B0CB3E22064C4C86,"  ABSTRACT Nina Christen designed some of the most influential shoes of the last decade. Now she has a line of her own. FULL TEXT Back in late 2018, a lifetime ago in fashion, a radical shift happened in footwear. Square-toed clunkers - sandals defined by exaggerated, spatula-like soles that jutted out from under the foot and pumps with bulbous stubbed toes - were shown in Daniel Lee's first collection for Bottega Veneta. At first sight, the shoes were hideous. Within months, they were on the feet of nearly every celebrity, editor, influencer and luxury V.I.C. in the land. Retailers like Vince Camuto and Shein promptly issued dupes of the popular Lido sandal, a simple slide in a blown-up interpretation of Bottega's signature intrecciato woven leather. Lyst declared them the ""hottest shoes in the world"" in 2019. ""It's funny what you can make people wear in fashion if it's done the right way,"" said Nina Christen, the Swiss shoe designer responsible for the Lido. Ms. Christen's distinctive touch has quite literally been all over some of the most influential shoe design trickling down from luxury houses for the better part of the last decade. She has worked for Phoebe Philo at Celine, Jonathan Anderson at Loewe, Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen at the Row and Mr. Lee at Bottega Veneta. Last month, Mr. Anderson hired Ms. Christen as the design director of shoes at Christian Dior. It's one of the biggest jobs in fashion right now, and she is balancing it with a moonlighting gig, too. Last year, Ms. Christen introduced Christen, her own independent shoe brand. The first pure expression of her design identity came partly out of frustration. The shoes she designed for other brands were her taste, her take, she said, ""but they were never 100 percent myself."" Opportunity arose when she met Paul Dupuy, an entrepreneur and a founder of Zoi, a health-tech company in the longevity space. Ms. Christen designed uniforms for Zoi's staff and clients, and Mr. Dupuy was so impressed that he offered to help her start her own brand. His mother was a fashion designer, and he has friends in the industry. He got it. ""When she told me she designed shoes for Loewe and Bottega, I was like: 'OK. This is solid,'"" Mr. Dupuy said. Ms. Christen already had a complete vision for a brand beyond shoes: the perfect pair of Japanese denim jeans, the perfect leather jacket, even fine jewelry, the first piece of which is a diamond toe ring. All are prototyped and planned. She had the packaging, branding, logo and positioning in mind. Mr. Dupuy raised $5 million in capital and helps with business logistics, including with the planning of a store in Paris slated for 2026. Christen shoes are produced in Italy by the same factories and specialists that work with big luxury brands. The prices - $1,100 to $3,650 - reflect Ms. Christen's uncompromising production standards and ambition to compete at the highest level. On a morning in late June, the raw cement floor of the studio below Ms. Christen's apartment in Paris was set with more than 30 examples of her designs arranged in a neatly art-directed grid. Three styles from Loewe's spring 2023 runway collection stood out for their cartoonish, fantastical qualities: There were pumps embroidered with an explosion of deflated white balloons and sandals abloom with a giant, hyper-realistic anthurium. Red rubber pumps that looked fit for Minnie Mouse were particularly complicated. ""You can't wear this for more than two hours,"" Ms. Christen said of the pumps. ""But Jonathan Anderson was very open to ideas that really crossed the line between art and fashion."" By comparison, the Christen styles on display appeared compact, sexy and razor-sharp. ""I love the space of geometric shapes,"" Ms. Christen said, surveying the body of work at her feet. ""When I think of toe shapes, for example, it's all about that. Is it a square? Is it rectangle? Is it a circle? Is it oval? What is the degree?"" She wore a pair of Christen white sandals that left the foot nearly naked, bisecting it with a single strip of leather like a strand of floss through the big and second toes. The sole was thin and slightly elongated under the toes, like an insole that was a size too big. The proportions of the shoes varied wildly, but a common thread was a certain offness. Ms. Christen thinks a lot about redefining standards. ""It's about creating things we are not used to yet,"" she said. ""When I make something and I don't know if I like it, that's always a good sign."" Ms. Christen, 40, grew up in Bern, Switzerland, ""obsessed with fashion without an explanation,"" she said....","ABSTRACT Nina Christen designed some of the most influential shoes of the last decade.

mov_9E3C81F41361729195AF80AB490A9CF9,"  A recent controversy surrounding Italian luxury label Prada has put the spotlight on how global fashion giants engage with India - a country whose rich artistic traditions have often suffered because of its inability to cash in on them. Prada got into trouble in June after its models walked the runway in Milan wearing , a handcrafted leather shoe made in India. The sandals are named after Kolhapur - a town in the western state of Maharashtra where they have been made for centuries - but the Prada collection did not mention this, prompting a backlash. As the controversy grew, Prada issued a statement saying it acknowledged the sandals' origins and that it was open to a ""dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans"". Over the past few days, a team from Prada met the artisans and shopkeepers in Kolhapur who make and sell the sandals to understand the process. Prada told the BBC that it held a ""successful meeting"" with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture, a prominent industry trade group. The statement also indicates that Prada may potentially collaborate in future with some manufacturers of Kolhapuri footwear. While it's not clear what form this collaboration may take, it's a rare example of a global fashion giant acknowledging that it failed to credit local artisans and the craft it was piggybacking on. Many big brands have been routinely accused of drawing inspiration from Indian, and wider South Asian, traditions in their quest to reinvent and stay relevant - but without crediting the source. Earlier this year, spring designs from Reformation and H&M after many said that their outfits appeared heavily inspired by South Asian garments. Both brands issued clarifications - while H&M denied the allegations, Reformation said its design was inspired by an outfit owned by a model with whom it had collaborated for the collection. And just two weeks ago, Dior was criticised after its highly-anticipated Paris collection featured a gold and ivory houndstooth coat, which many pointed out was crafted with mukaish work, a centuries-old metal embroidery technique from northern India. The collection did not mention the roots of the craft or India at all. The BBC has reached out to Dior for comment. Some experts say that not every brand that draws inspiration from a culture does so with wrong intentions - designers around the world invoke aesthetics from different traditions all the time, spotlighting them on a global scale. In the highly competitive landscape of fashion, some argue that brands also don't get enough time to think through the cultural ramifications of their choices. But critics point out that any borrowing needs to be underpinned by respect and acknowledgement, especially when these ideas are repurposed by powerful global brands to be sold at incredibly high prices. ""Giving due credit is a part of design responsibility, it's taught to you in design school and brands need to educate themselves about it,"" says Shefalee Vasudev, a Delhi-based fashion writer. Not doing so, she adds, is ""cultural neglect towards a part of the world which brands claim to love"". Estimates vary about the size of India's luxury market, but the region is widely seen as a big growth opportunity. Analysts from Boston Consulting Group say the luxury retail market in India by 2032. Powered by an expanding and affluent middle class, global luxury brands are increasingly eyeing India as a key market as they hope to make up for weaker demand elsewhere. But not everyone shares the optimism. Arvind Singhal, chairman of consultancy firm Technopak, says a big reason for the seeming indifference is that most brands still don't consider India a significant market for high-end luxury fashion. In recent years, many high-end malls with flagship luxury stores have opened up in big cities - but they rarely see significant footfall. ""Names like Prada still mean nothing to a majority of Indians. There is some demand among the super-rich, but hardly any first-time customers,"" Mr Singhal says. ""And this is simply not enough to build a business, making it easy to neglect the region altogether."" Anand Bhushan, a fashion designer from Delhi, agrees. He says that traditionally, India has always been a production hub rather than a potential market, with some of the most expensive brands in Paris and Milan employing Indian artisans to make or embroider their garments. ""But that still does not mean you can just blatantly lift a culture without understanding the history and context and brand it for millions of dollars,"" he adds. The frustration, he says, is not focused on any one label but has been building for years. The most memorable misstep, according to him, took place during the Karl Lagerfeld ""Paris-Bombay"" Métiers d'Art collection, showcased in 2011. The collection featured sari-draped dresses, Nehru-collared jackets and ornate headpieces. Many called it a fine example of cultural collaboration, but others argued it relied heavily on clichéd imagery and lacked authentic representation of India. Others, however, say no brand can afford to write off India as insignificant. ""We might not be the fastest-growing luxury market like China, but a younger and more sophisticated generation of Indians with different tastes and aspirations is reshaping the landscape of luxury,"" says Nonita Kalra, editor-in-chief of online luxury store Tata CliQ Luxury. In the case of Prada, she says the brand seemed to have made a ""genuine oversight"", evident from the lengths to which it has gone to rectify its mistake. For Ms Kalra, the problem is a broader one - where brands based in the west and run by a homogenous group of people end up viewing consumers in other parts of the world through a foreign lens. ""The lack of diversity is the biggest blind spot of the fashion industry, and brands need to hire people from different parts of the world to change that,"" she says. ""But their love and respect for Indian heritage is genuine."" The question of cultural appropriation is complex, and the debates it sparks online can seem both overblown and eye-opening. And while there are no simple answers, many feel the outrage around Prada has been a great starting point to demand better accountability from brands and designers who, until now, have largely remained unchallenged. It is an opportunity for India, too, to reflect on the ways it can support its own heritage and uplift it. Weavers toil for weeks or months to finish one masterpiece, but they often work in precarious conditions without adequate remuneration and with no protection for their work under international intellectual property laws. ""We don't take enough pride and credit our own artisans, allowing others to walk all over it,"" Ms Vasudev says. ""The trouble also is that in India we have simply too much. There are hundreds of different craft techniques and traditions - each with its constantly evolving motif directory going back centuries,"" says Laila Tyabji, chairperson of Dastkar, which promotes crafts and craftspeople. ""We bargain and bicker over a pair of fully embroidered juthis (shoes) but have no issues over buying a pair of Nike trainers at 10 times the price - even though the latter has come off an assembly line while each juthi has been painstakingly and uniquely crafted by hand,"" she says. And while that continues, she says, foreign designers and merchandisers will do the same....","A recent controversy surrounding Italian luxury label Prada has put the spotlight on how global fashion giants engage with India - a country whose rich artistic traditions have often suffered because of its inability to cash in on them.

Ini bukan sembarang mode karena menandai debut rancangan Jonathan Anderson, direktur kreatif baru Dior.  Melansir Marie Claire, Kamis, 17 Juli 2025, Anderson dan tim menghabiskan waktu lebih dari 100 jam untuk membuatnya, karena mereka melipat setiap bahan untuk rok dengan tangan. Satu bagian rok ini dibuat tetap datar, sebuah gambaran yang jelas dari sudut pandang Anderson yang tidak biasa terhadap bentuk klasik. Foto-foto di balik layar memperlihatkan rok pannier hoop di atas salah satu pinggul, sementara yang lain dibiarkan tanpa rok dalam. Atasan bertali spageti Jisoo BLACKPINK tampak sangat cantik, dengan pita tebal di atas satin monokrom. Namun, Anderson sedikit memiringkan pita tersebut, mirip dengan bagaimana ia melapisi dasi jas di atas kerah yang tersorot pada koleksi busana pria Spring 2026. Untuk bagian aksesori, Jisoo menambahkan sentuhan grunge pada pakaian femininnya dengan sepatu bot setinggi lutut dari studio Prancis dengan harga 2,2 ribu dolar AS (sekitar Rp35 juta). Sepatu ini terbuat dari kulit mengkilap dan memiliki tumit tebal, cocok untuk menunjang penampilan panggung idola berusia 30 tahun tersebut. Pemilik nama Kim Jisoo ini jadi duta global Dior untuk mode dan kecantikan pada Maret 2021. Sejak itu, ia dikenal sebagai ""Human Dior"" karena sering mengenakan barang label tersebut. Hubungannya dengan Dior tampaknya tetap kuat di era Anderson, dengan Jisoo menulis di unggahan Instagram-nya, baru-baru ini, ""Tidak sabar untuk mengenakan lebih banyak gaya."" Pelantun lagu FLOWER ini tidak pernah melewatkan pesta Dior selama masa jabatan mantan direktur kreatif Maria Grazia Chiuri. Ia telah menghadiri setiap peragaan busana sejak September 2021, sambil membintangi berbagai kampanye mode dan kecantikan. Baru-baru ini, Jisoo mengamankan tempat duduk di barisan depan untuk presentasi Dior Fall/Winter 2025. Sebelum pertunjukan, ia melambaikan tangan pada para penggemar, mengenakan blus putih berkorset, rok hitam berenda, dan sepatu bot bertali. Jisoo memiliki tas D-Journey, D-Motion, dan D-Vibe, tapi saat itu, ia membawa tas Lady Dior yang langka. Jisoo adalah penggemar berat Dior seumur hidup, terlepas dari siapa yang memimpin. Ia kemungkinan besar sudah mengonfirmasi kehadirannya di peragaan busana wanita perdana Anderson pada Oktober 2025. Tampilan Jisoo di panggung baru-baru ini menggenapi kebahagiaan BLINK, sebutan penggemar grup tersebut. Setelah penantian yang terasa seperti selamanya, keempat personel BLACKPINK akhirnya kembali beraktivitas sebagai grup. Ini bukan sekadar konser comeback biasa. Mengutip Times of India, Jumat (18/7/2025), BLACKPINK merupakan girl group K-pop pertama yang tampil di Stadion Goyang, Korea Selatan, dengan 78 ribu penggemar hadir selama dua malam pertunjukan. Jumlah ini mencetak rekor jumlah penonton terbanyak yang pernah dicapai artis K-pop mana pun. Jumlah itu lebih banyak daripada jumlah penonton di beberapa kota. Tiga hari setelah konser, tepatnya pada 8 Juli 2025, Jisoo membagikan perasaannya di media sosial. Ia menulis, ""Terima kasih pada semua BLINK dan semua yang telah bergabung dengan kami untuk menyambut awal musim panas yang hangat! Tur Dunia DEADLINE Dimulai!! Kami kembali!"" Namun, yang benar-benar menyentuh hati semua orang adalah pesan spesialnya untuk para penggemar di seluruh dunia. Foto-foto yang dipublikasikannya adalah potret yang membuat penggemar bahagia, seperti  momen di panggung, foto candid di ruang ganti, dan foto-foto panggung epik yang membuat Anda ingin berada di sana. Dari gaun mini uniknya yang bertali hingga busana panggung yang anggun, Jisoo menampilkan penampilan yang sangat baik.

mov_1AC0A931F3C2FC93F52212F7399E3B1A,"  It has been a busy year for the luxury world. Arguably, it has been an even busier year for me. While I am still processing this life parenthesis, it is time to get this blog back on track. Indeed, I took the decision to carve more time to go back to what I like most: art and fashion. To start off this come back, I want to discuss the arrival of Jonathan Anderson at Dior. In early June, JWA was confirmed at the helm of one of my favorite luxury houses. This applies to both men and women. Kim Jones (formerly doing Dior Men) and Maria Grazia Chiuri (Women) will be missed, and I cannot wait for their future endeavors. Similarly, JWA will be dearly missed at Loewe which skyrocketed both culturally and commercially under his leadership. Let's see what the future holds for the Madrid Maison. Hôtel des Invalides, Courtesy Dior JWA is not new to the intersection of art and fashion. He collaborated with numerous contemporary artists while at Loewe: Lara Favaretto, Lynda Benglis or Anthea Hamilton are among my favorites. He gave them a stage. But this time, his approach is slightly different. At Loewe, Anderson had almost a cultural blank state in terms of references beyond the house codes. This was despite Loewe being the oldest fashion house of the LVMH group. But Dior comes with a rich history and cultural capital. A series of star designers before him have built on this. And in fact, the fashion, the communication, and the staging of the Men's show were about inspirations and references, not getting contemporary artists under the spotlight. « When I thought about how to expand the horizons of the Maison, I thought about Christian Dior, whom, after the Second World War, looked back to the past to create the New Look » said Anderson. Yet, the subversiveness of JWA's style transpires in the designs, showing his willingness to bridge tradition and modernity. Dior Men by Jonathan Anderson, Courtesy Numéro Magazine The fashion is where this tension is the most prominent. The Dior Delft dress and its folds inspired a wide androgynous pair of shorts. The collars on straight shirts were purposely crooked while perfectly ironed. Ties were mixed with Canadian tuxedos. Delicate flowers adorned heavy Irish-inspired knits. Bows and jellyfish-leather shoes flirted and traditional tailcoats cohabited with chunky sneakers. Soft pinks and grey hues, among Mr. Dior's signature colors, sprinkled the looks through the show. References to traditional inspirations went beyond the house of Dior with tote bags referencing Dracula by Bram Stocker (1897), Les Liaisons dangereuses by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos (1782), Bonjour tristesse by Françoise Sagan (1954) and a sentence Dior by Dior.

Melody 被身邊工作人員突襲拍攝家中日常，沒想到三大櫃的精品包牆意外曝光，讓人忍不住驚呼她真的是資深包控！ 其中一區更是滿滿的愛馬仕橘盒堆疊如牆，讓人瞬間理解她口中「不是失心瘋，是多年收藏」這句話的分量。 當鏡頭掃過她的小包收藏時，Melody 邊笑邊喊：「真的還好啦！」 甚至還一度躲進櫃子裡避難，笑翻網友。 CHANEL 2.55包
Melody 拿出CHANEL 2.55 經典包，輕描淡寫地說：「這個應該可以吧？」 她形容這款包不但漂亮又耐看，更是一個能抵抗通膨的時尚投資品，女兒則淡定回應：「It's nice.」雖然評語平實，但從表情就知道，這包已經被悄悄放進心願清單！ 雲朵包、The Row、康康包…女兒也點名
Melody 還分享大女兒主動點名的包款，Bottega Veneta 的 POUCH 雲朵包，她特別保存全新版本，只等女兒長大來繼承。 而由「富貴花們」送的 THE ROW 水桶包，她也愛不釋手。 說到愛馬仕經典的康康包，她表示：「那時候我很喜歡，H 是法郎的，白色、酒紅、黑色都有！」 典藏色讓人驚艷。 柏金、Peekaboo、Loom 都是溫柔實用派
提到收藏中的大咖，Melody 當然也少不了愛馬仕柏金包。 她坦言以前年輕追求大包，30、35cm 的尺寸是當時流行，但現在則因為太重而少背。 反倒是像 FENDI 的 Peekaboo 她會定期檢查保養，特別喜歡它的溫柔色調。 而 Loro Piana 的 Loom 包則是她最近最滿意的選品，帆布與小牛皮的對比搭配，精緻又輕盈。 女兒點頭的 DIOR 30 Montaigne
最後一款讓女兒點頭稱讚的是 DIOR 的 30 Montaigne 白色配金扣包款，經典百搭又有現代感，Melody 滿足地表示：「大女兒應該也是蠻滿意的。」 從收藏到傳承，Melody 不僅展現了她的時尚品味，也默默為女兒準備好一整座精品寶藏牆！ 圖片來源：小紅書

From discounted offerings to previously elusive luxury and global brands, e-commerce and quick commerce platforms are witnessing a multifold surge in beauty and skincare product sales amid soaring demand. In fact, capitalizing on this trend, Zepto co-founder Aadit Palicha last week announced the 10-minute delivery for luxury cosmetic brands-- Estée Lauder's M.A.C., The Ordinary and Clinique--on the platform. After observing a surge in demand for existing beauty brands like Maybelline, Lakmé, and Faces Canada, Mamaearth, Renee, Swiss Beauty, and SUGAR Cosmetics, Zepto decided to expand its portfolio by including luxury brands as well, to offer users a wider range of options, said Devendra Meel, Chief Business Officer at Zepto. According to a report by Bengaluru-based consultancy firm Redseer, India's beauty industry is expected to reach $34 billion by 2028, driven by rising disposable incomes, increased consumer aspirations, and the influence of social media and e-commerce. Highlighting changing consumer behaviour, Amazon Beauty, Director Siddharth Bhagat told Storyboard18 about a strong shift towards tech-enabled, trend-led and personalised experiences for the cosmetics and skincare products. He said that faster deliveries, influencer-driven discovery, and the rise of D2C and international brands are further fueling the momentum. ""Amazon has witnessed a 12x growth in cosmetics due to the recent success of newly launched brands in 2025,"" Bhagat added. Nykaa, the pioneer in building a beauty-centric digital commerce platform, said its beauty business has grown 25 percent on a year-on-year basis, recording a revenue of Rs 7,251 crore for fiscal year 2025. Nykaa's beauty vertical includes e-commerce, physical retail, its house of brands, as well as an eB2B business. Nykaa's closest competitor, Myntra, has also ramped up its beauty segment on the platform to capitalise on the demand. Deepak Joshi, Senior Director - Category Management, Beauty and Personal Care, Myntra said the platform's dedicated 'Beauty' segment has outpaced the online beauty market by two-fold, registering more than 50 percent consistent year-on-year increase in monthly active users. ""Currently, Myntra Beauty boasts more than 2,900 brands,"" Joshi added. 'Tier-2 demand surge' Industry experts have acknowledged that tier-2 cities have emerged as a crucial market for platforms, driving demand for both affordable and premium cosmetics and skincare products. Meel from Zepto said that while quick commerce has largely remained metro-centric, traction for beauty products has notably increased in Tier-2 cities as well. Myntra's Joshi also noted that nearly half of the beauty buyers on the platform come from tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Besides, He also mentioned that Myntra's quick commerce service, M-Now, witnessed a 1.4x spike in demand for beauty products on Mother's Day in 2025. Notably, Vishal Chaturvedi, Vice President, The Body Shop, Asia South, said that quick commerce has delivered exceptional results for the company, almost doubling its growth compared to last year. ""Our specially curated selection of packed gift boxes and mini packs has seen strong sales on the quick commerce platform,"" Chaturvedi said. 'Rise of K-Beauty' In the competitive beauty market, digital commerce platforms have expanded their portfolio by adding luxury and premium beauty offerings, particularly Korean beauty (K-beauty) brands. According to the Amazon spokesperson, the K-Beauty category on the platform has witnessed a 75 percent year-on-year growth. According to Bhagat, K-beauty products primarily resonates with urban and digital-savvy women, aged between 20 and 35 years. ""The urban women have embraced K-beauty products to a larger extent, especially from cities like Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Pune"". Moreover, women from tier-2 cities are also exploring the K-beauty products through trial SKUs like sheet masks and minis, he added. Bucking the trend, Bhagat said Amazon has observed that a rising cohort of male consumers are also experimenting with Korean skincare, particularly around functional solutions like cleansers, serums, and sunscreens. A range of K-beauty brands have entered into Indian market via digital commerce platforms, such as COSRX, Laneige, and Beauty of Joseon, TIRTIR, Medicube, and Skin1004. Meanwhile, Myntra said that they have witnessed a 150 percent YoY growth in K-beauty category. Beyond K-beauty, several international luxury beauty brands are also capturing Indian consumers' attention through digital channels. Nykaa has a dedicated segment, called Nykaa Luxe, which offers a wide range of cosmetics and skincare products from luxury brands such as Armani beauty, Chanel, L'Oréal Luxe, Eucerin, Dior, Tom Ford, sol de janerio, among others. The company noted that the average annual spend by its top 10% customers is $395 on premium beauty products.

Myntra's quick commerce venture also offers a selection of international and premium beauty brands, including YSL and Estee Lauder.
