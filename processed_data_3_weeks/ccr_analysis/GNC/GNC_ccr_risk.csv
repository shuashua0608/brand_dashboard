18052392026597509,"  Supplements are NOT approved by the FDA before hitting store shelves. Unlike medications, companies don't have to prove they're safe or effective. ❌ Contamination with heavy metals ❌ Undeclared prescription drugs ❌ Wrong doses or fake ingredients ❌ Hidden stimulants or banned substances ❗This isn't rare — it's happening right now in products you can buy at Walmart, Amazon, or GNC. OxyElite Pro – Linked to liver failure and pulled after reports of death. Hydroxycut – Caused seizures and liver damage, recalled in 2009. Ephedra (Ma Huang) – Connected to over 100 deaths, finally banned in 2004. Kratom – Still legal, despite causing addiction and fatal overdoses. ARIIX Rejuveniix – Contained hidden pharmaceutical drugs. These were all sold legally until people got hurt. ❗Just because it's on a store shelf doesn't mean it's safe. The FDA does not test or approve supplements before they're sold — and some have caused liver failure, heart attacks, and even death. Scary? It should be. Here's how to stay safe: Look for THIRD-PARTY TESTING. Since the FDA doesn't regulate supplements for safety, third-party testing is your only real way to know: ✅ What's actually in the bottle ✅ That it doesn't contain harmful contaminants ✅ That the dose matches the label ✅ That it's free from banned or hidden substances Trusted Third-Party Seals to Look For: NSF Certified for Sport USP Verified ConsumerLab Informed Choice If your supplement doesn't have any of these? That's a red flag ✨ Bottom Line: Not all supplements are bad — but many are untested, contaminated, or outright dangerous. Do your homework, ask questions, and only buy products that are third-party tested.
