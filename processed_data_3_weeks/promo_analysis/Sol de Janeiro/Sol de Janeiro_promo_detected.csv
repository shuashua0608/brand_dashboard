mov_0DFD1F8ECF69FAB1F680EFD0FB1B76F1,"  Fragrance aficionados are raving about a perfume that's been hailed as ""the best ever made"" by its loyal fans. At the reasonable price of £23.95, Calvin Klein's Eternity Moment for Women Eau De Parfum is capturing the hearts of purchasers who claim they ""can't imagine being without it"". Blending notes of lychee and guava with passionflower and musks, Eternity Moment delivers a delicate floral fragrance that users report has impressive lasting power. Crowned 'number one best-seller' in Amazon's fragrance category, this scent boasts an impressive tally of over 24,000 reviews on the platform, showcasing an average rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars. Those on the hunt for more affordable floral and musk perfumes might be keen to explore Cosmic by Kylie Jenner Eau de Parfum, presently £55 for a 100ml bottle at LookFantastic, or Narciso Rodriguez For Her Musc Noir, now just £54.99 for a 50ml bottle, slashed from £92 at The Perfume Shop. Meanwhile, back at Amazon, the Calvin Klein fragrance continues to attract glowing reviews, with many customers complimenting its delightful scent and durability. However, some remarks indicate it might be ""too sweet"", which serves as a reminder that scent preferences are highly individual. One enthusiastic customer raved: ""Absolute Game Changer. This has genuinely made such a difference-I didn't realise how much I needed it until I had it. Now I can't imagine being without it. It's reliable, well made, and just makes life that little bit better every day. Total game changer. If you're on the fence, take this as your sign to go for it!"" , reports the Liverpool Echo. Emma gushed: ""The best perfume ever made. You wanna know how good this perfume is? I have tried probably 30-40 perfumes in my life and never found one that I love AND actually stays on my skin. This lasts all day. Literally all day. I put it on yesterday after my bath about 6pm. . can still smell it 10am the next day and on clothes even longer. I love it that much I ordered another bottle a few days later as didn't wanna lose out on the amazing price.

Jackie commented: ""Very sweet smelling. Age range range for the young."" On the other hand, Maria praised the perfume, saying: ""Great!

Learn more For beauty lovers on the hunt for a new signature summer scent, Amazon has reduced the price of this 'beautiful' and 'opulent' option that has a 'lingering scent' down to £22.50 as part of an early Prime Day deal. The Jimmy Choo Fever Eau de Parfum was originally priced at £51 and has been rated a glowing 4.7 out of 5 in the product description. The perfume is described as 'addictive' in a gorgeous deep plum bottle. Top notes include black plum nectar with roasted tonka bean and floral. To apply, hold the fragrance five inches away and spray your skin, focusing on pulse points (neck and wrists). According to Amazon's AI overview of reviews: ""Customers find this perfume to be an opulent scent that lasts all day. They describe it as sweet, warm, and eye-catching, with excellent quality and good value for money. Customers appreciate its longevity, with one noting its amazing staying power, and consider it a great gift option."" Alternatively, if you'd prefer a gift set to get a sense of a few different scents, LOOKFANTASTIC has slashed the price of this Sol de Janeiro Exclusive & Limited Edition Perfume Mist Discovery Set from £38 to £26.60 (prices accurate at the time of writing). The set features four different Sol De Janeiro scents and looks perfect for travel. Meanwhile, back over on Amazon, one shopper said: ""Fab perfume. Lovely and long lasting scent.

A fourth shopper added: ""What is there to say? I absolutely love this perfume, it smells divine and always lasts all day. Had to treat myself."" It's important to note that the 40ml bottle has been reduced to £22.50, as some shoppers stated that it was 'smaller than they thought' in reviews.

mov_27D5CAF6F05A62CD128CE9E1F5F3E24C,"  The sales on these beloved products could be gone before Prime Day is even over. Amazon Prime Day deals are here for four days this year, but that doesn't mean all your favorite products will be on sale for that full length of time. Popular products tend to sell out quickly when the discounts are this deep, so if you've had your eye on something, you don't want to miss your chance to grab it on sale. Below, we tracked down some of the most beloved products that are on sale right now — and all of these have historically sold out quickly. If you spot something on this list that you've been waiting to add to your cart, wait no more. A deal this good may not come around again for a while. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. Stasher 10-piece reusable silicone storage bag set (40% off list price) Stasher's popular reusable storage bags can help you cut down on plastic waste (as well as the cost of buying single-use plastic bags), and we don't expect them to last long on the shelves. This 10-pack comes with bags in six different sizes, as well as four stretch lids. All are made with silicone and are safe for use in the dishwasher, freezer, microwave and oven. The TikTok-viral Meridian body hair trimmer (40% off list price) Rarely on sale for a price this low, this Meridian body hair trimmer is a viral product that may see a ton of orders this Prime Day (plenty of reviews mention first seeing it on TikTok). The trimmer can be used by both men and women, is 100% waterproof and promises a close shave without irritation, redness, ingrown hair, razor burn or bumps. It's cordless and rechargeable, and comes with an anti-nick guard to keep you safe. Cabeau TNE travel neck pillow (25% off list price) You might be familiar with Cabeau's popular neck pillows, and their TNE memory foam pillow will be on sale for Prime Day. Available in a bunch of different colors, this pillow is a must-have for flights, long train or car rides and more: It has seat straps you can attach to your chair to keep your head and neck in alignment, prevents your head from falling forward with ""head catch"" technology and is made with ergonomic memory foam. It also comes with a travel bag you can attach to your luggage. A bestselling absorbent and slip-resistant bath mat (50% off list price) An already affordable product just got an even better price. Gorilla Grip reports that their popular bath mat — which has 4.3 stars across more than 76,000 ratings — sold over 10,000 units in the past month alone, so with this half-off discount, we're expecting shoppers to flock here. Made with cozy, plush chenille, the absorbent bath mat has a textured rubber backing and is slip- and fade-resistant. It comes in so many sizes and colors, so you can match your bathroom's style and needs easily. Anua niacinamide 10 + TXA 4 serum (30% off list price) With the ongoing tariff situation potentially affecting the prices of Korean skin care and beauty products, as well as K-beauty's general popularity during Prime Day, we could see products like this Anua serum selling out. The brand reports that more than 40,000 units of the serum were bought in just the last month, too. Suitable for all skin types, the fragrance-free serum contains 10% niacinamide, as well as other skin-boosting ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramide to help your skin glow and provide hydration. The texture is described as lightweight and non-greasy, making this an easy add to any skin care routine. Lumineux teeth whitening strips (33% off list price) Yes, the ever-popular Crest 3D Whitestrips will be on sale for Prime Day (they appear elsewhere on this list), but we could also see this Lumineux alternative selling out too — it's garnered over 56,000 ratings with a 4.1-star average. These also come dentist-recommended for patients with sensitive teeth. The strips are enamel-safe and peroxide-free, relying on natural ingredients like coconut oil, lemon peel oil and more. Sol de Janeiro hair and body perfume mist (20% off list price) A constant Amazon beauty bestseller, we pretty much never see this Sol de Janeiro perfume mist on sale, so be prepared to grab it while you can. The mist comes in a ton of different scents, though the beachy, summer-ready Cheirosa '62 is probably the most well-known (it matches the viral Brazilian Bum Bum Cream scent, which also appears on this list). You can get a bottle in two sizes, including one that's travel-friendly. Blueair's newest air purifier (20% off list price) This Prime Day is the first time ever that Blueair's newest air purifier, the Blue Signature, is on sale, so you'll want to jump on this deal while you can. The purifier boasts seven stages of filtration, odor-blocking technology and an air quality indicator. You can control it using the accompanying app to set a schedule and get alerts for when the filter needs replacing. The purifier can clean up to 3,385 square feet and can even double as a table to make it multifunctional. Cocokind ceramide barrier serum (25% off list price) Another offering from a popular skin care brand, Cocokind's ceramide barrier serum can help soothe and hydrate the skin barrier using squalane and beta-glucan, as well as five ceramides. According to the brand, these ingredients can offer more hydration than hyaluronic acid, and with a comfortable, lightweight feel, the serum can layer with retinol, vitamin C and other skin care products and instantly absorb into the skin. HexClad 6-piece nonstick fry pan set (20% off list price) You're probably familiar with HexClad, the Gordon Ramsay-approved cookware brand. We could see this 6-piece set going quickly with the offered discount: It contains fry pans of three sizes (8-, 10- and 12-inch) as well as lids for each. The hexagonal nonstick surface provides an even sear and is easy to clean, not to mention dishwasher- and oven-safe up to 400 degrees....","The sales on these beloved products could be gone before Prime Day is even over.

The TikTok-viral Meridian body hair trimmer (40% off list price) Rarely on sale for a price this low, this Meridian body hair trimmer is a viral product that may see a ton of orders this Prime Day (plenty of reviews mention first seeing it on TikTok). The trimmer can be used by both men and women, is 100% waterproof and promises a close shave without irritation, redness, ingrown hair, razor burn or bumps. It's cordless and rechargeable, and comes with an anti-nick guard to keep you safe. Cabeau TNE travel neck pillow (25% off list price) You might be familiar with Cabeau's popular neck pillows, and their TNE memory foam pillow will be on sale for Prime Day. Available in a bunch of different colors, this pillow is a must-have for flights, long train or car rides and more: It has seat straps you can attach to your chair to keep your head and neck in alignment, prevents your head from falling forward with ""head catch"" technology and is made with ergonomic memory foam. It also comes with a travel bag you can attach to your luggage. A bestselling absorbent and slip-resistant bath mat (50% off list price) An already affordable product just got an even better price. Gorilla Grip reports that their popular bath mat — which has 4.3 stars across more than 76,000 ratings — sold over 10,000 units in the past month alone, so with this half-off discount, we're expecting shoppers to flock here. Made with cozy, plush chenille, the absorbent bath mat has a textured rubber backing and is slip- and fade-resistant. It comes in so many sizes and colors, so you can match your bathroom's style and needs easily. Anua niacinamide 10 + TXA 4 serum (30% off list price) With the ongoing tariff situation potentially affecting the prices of Korean skin care and beauty products, as well as K-beauty's general popularity during Prime Day, we could see products like this Anua serum selling out. The brand reports that more than 40,000 units of the serum were bought in just the last month, too. Suitable for all skin types, the fragrance-free serum contains 10% niacinamide, as well as other skin-boosting ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramide to help your skin glow and provide hydration. The texture is described as lightweight and non-greasy, making this an easy add to any skin care routine. Lumineux teeth whitening strips (33% off list price) Yes, the ever-popular Crest 3D Whitestrips will be on sale for Prime Day (they appear elsewhere on this list), but we could also see this Lumineux alternative selling out too — it's garnered over 56,000 ratings with a 4.1-star average. These also come dentist-recommended for patients with sensitive teeth. The strips are enamel-safe and peroxide-free, relying on natural ingredients like coconut oil, lemon peel oil and more. Sol de Janeiro hair and body perfume mist (20% off list price) A constant Amazon beauty bestseller, we pretty much never see this Sol de Janeiro perfume mist on sale, so be prepared to grab it while you can. The mist comes in a ton of different scents, though the beachy, summer-ready Cheirosa '62 is probably the most well-known (it matches the viral Brazilian Bum Bum Cream scent, which also appears on this list). You can get a bottle in two sizes, including one that's travel-friendly. Blueair's newest air purifier (20% off list price) This Prime Day is the first time ever that Blueair's newest air purifier, the Blue Signature, is on sale, so you'll want to jump on this deal while you can. The purifier boasts seven stages of filtration, odor-blocking technology and an air quality indicator. You can control it using the accompanying app to set a schedule and get alerts for when the filter needs replacing. The purifier can clean up to 3,385 square feet and can even double as a table to make it multifunctional. Cocokind ceramide barrier serum (25% off list price) Another offering from a popular skin care brand, Cocokind's ceramide barrier serum can help soothe and hydrate the skin barrier using squalane and beta-glucan, as well as five ceramides. According to the brand, these ingredients can offer more hydration than hyaluronic acid, and with a comfortable, lightweight feel, the serum can layer with retinol, vitamin C and other skin care products and instantly absorb into the skin. HexClad 6-piece nonstick fry pan set (20% off list price) You're probably familiar with HexClad, the Gordon Ramsay-approved cookware brand. We could see this 6-piece set going quickly with the offered discount: It contains fry pans of three sizes (8-, 10- and 12-inch) as well as lids for each. The hexagonal nonstick surface provides an even sear and is easy to clean, not to mention dishwasher- and oven-safe up to 400 degrees....",2025-07-08 09:00:17,en,WEB,,,,51a62a26de1171a21bc144b375284d18,,False,1,True,Affiliate,Medium,False,"The text appears to be a promotional product roundup typical of affiliate marketing content on Amazon Prime Day.

If you are lucky enough to have a tween girl in your life, you know there's a constant stream of requests for the newest, hottest, most slay-worthy products they can imagine.

The Owala Free Sip in purple and the massive Stanley IceFlow in the 30-ounce size are both 25% off.

A joint diary where you can write to each other without having a face-to-face conversation can keep the lines of communication open and let them know you're always there.

mov_7258CD92C43C5E8A3FB94017BC1A412D,"  In my years as a shopping editor, the times I buy a new beauty product at full price are few and far between. Whether I need to restock my combination skincare routine or am looking to test a buzzy new beauty device, a great deal is always around the corner. Looks like it's true that good things come to those who wait—Amazon Prime Day is here just in time to refresh my summer beauty routine. From now through July 11, you can spot hundreds (if not thousands) of deals on Amazon in every major category, including summer shoes and vacation essentials. However, it's the sale of the year for beauty fans as top brands like Supergoop, Sol de Janeiro, Shark Beauty, Laneige, and so many more are at a major discount. To put it simply, Amazon Prime Day is not a sale you want to skip. To ensure you don't miss out on any of the incredible discounts, I'm bringing you the ultimate edit of Amazon Prime Day's best beauty deals. Ahead, uncover some of our editors' holy grail nail finds, skincare, fragrance, devices, makeup, and hair care currently on sale. Be sure to keep this page bookmarked, as the beauty deals will continue to arrive as I discover them in real-time. The Best Overall Beauty Deals at Amazon Prime Day Amazon Prime Day at a Glance Best Skincare Deals at Amazon Prime Day Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Spf 50 (Was $38) While technically this is a facial sunscreen, it doubles as a makeup primer that can be used anytime, anywhere. Katherine J. Igoe, an MC contributing editor, says, ""It goes on smoothly and feels incredibly lightweight without any of the annoyances of most sunscreens."" Katherine J. Igoe tests Supergoop! Unseen Sunscren SPF 50. (Image credit: MC Editors) Bioderma Bioderma Sensibio H2o Micellar Water (Was $14) Waterproof mascara, SPF, makeup, and dirt don't stand a chance with this French pharmacy favorite in your routine. A couple of drops on a cotton pad will remove your makeup, all while balancing pH, hydrating, and soothing skin. CeraVe Cerave Hydrating Cream to Foam Cleanser (Was $20) This cleanser is just what your skincare routine needs as a first step—it gently removes makeup and grime without drying out your skin. The cream lathers quickly into a foam, so a little bit goes a long way. Embryolisse Embryolisse Lait-Crème Concentré (Was $29) Another French beauty staple, this moisturizer will have your skin feeling baby soft and smooth in no time. It's a rich cream that deeply nourishes the skin, without feeling too heavy or leaving behind any greasiness. Kiehl's Avocado Eye Treatment (Was $38) This is one of the best eye creams for dryness, so it's not a bad idea to stock up before the fall. It uses avocado oil and caffeine to help smooth puffy eyes and fine lines and to boost radiance. Best Beauty Device Deals at Amazon Prime Day Shark Shark Hd430 Flexstyle Air Styling & Drying System (Was $350) As someone with minimal hair styling skills, the Shark FlexStyle is the only way I know how to do my hair. It's easy as can be to use, and I can create a variety of styles from big, bouncy curls to sleek blowouts. Brooke Knappenberger tests the auto-wrap curler attachments of the Shark FlexStyle. (Image credit: Brooke Knappenberger.) Braun Ipl Silk·expert Pro (Was $380) Marie Claire's fashion commerce editor, Julia Marzovilla, tested this laser hair device and raved about her results.

Promising review: ""I used to make fun of people for using these Stanley cups; I always thought they were overpriced and overhyped. But I purchased this for my little sister who is in nursing school, and she takes this thing with her everywhere!!! All she does is rave about how amazing it is! So I bought one as well, and they really are amazing products. Made super well, they keep ice in them for hours and hours! Super comfortable to hold in your hand, not too heavy or bulky. Easy to clean and seem to be super durable. I've dropped mine I don't even know how many times now, and not a single mark! They also don't leak easy at all. Unless you're holding it completely upside down, even then it doesn't leak fast.

From all sorts of fitness and health metrics to communication features (like texting and calling when your iPhone is out of reach) and even a car crash detection feature that can connect you to emergency services, it'll have your back no matter what the day throws at you. It's also swimproof with 50m water resistance too! Promising review: ""The Apple Watch Series 10 with Cellular is hands-down the best smartwatch I've ever owned. It's sleek, fast, and packed with features that make everyday life easier — from tracking workouts and heart rate to answering calls and messages without needing my phone nearby. The cellular feature gives me true freedom when I'm out running or running errands, and the improved battery life easily gets me through the day.

This is a cult-favorite body cream you're going to want to slather all over your body, thanks to the deep hydration (cupuaçu butter, coconut oil, and açai oil!) and temporary skin-tightening (caffeine!) it provides, plus a fragrance with notes of salted caramel and vanilla that reviewers L O V E.

But I'm also not into telling my sweet angel friends that the perfume I'm wearing costs as much as they spent on floor seats at The Eras Tour (resale). They don't deserve to have their hearts broken like that! I'm a good friend, which is why I always have my eyes peeled for the cheap perfumes. And this Amazon Prime Day is coming in pretty hot with the perfume deals. I'm floored at the discounts on the best Amazon perfumes right now—we're talking up to 50 percent off designer fragrances I've never seen dip below 20 percent off before. And that's the thing: Amazon's perfume assortment is pretty vast. There's a affordable fragrances from brands like Sol De Janeiro (which is currently all 20 percent off right now) and Dossier (currently all 20 percent off as well), but there's also celebrity perfumes like Sabrina Carpenter Fragrance (20 percent off!) and the iconic Carolina Herrera Good Girl (20 percent off—like it's wild!!) . There are fancy eau de parfums, body sprays, hair perfumes—legit everything to also make you the best-smelling person of your friend group. Our top picks for the best perfumes on Amazon in 2025: Snag one of the below before the end of Amazon Prime Day (it goes from now until July 11, btw) if you want to get a really good deal on a new signature scent. Or shop one of the other fab deals our editors' have rounded up on our Cosmopolitan Amazon Storefront. We're actually professional shoppers, so we know what we're talking about.","It's kind of a thing that I'm the best-smelling person of my friend group. It comes with the territory. Beauty editor and all. But I'm also not into telling my sweet angel friends that the perfume I'm wearing costs as much as they spent on floor seats at The Eras Tour (resale). They don't deserve to have their hearts broken like that! I'm a good friend, which is why I always have my eyes peeled for the cheap perfumes. And this Amazon Prime Day is coming in pretty hot with the perfume deals. I'm floored at the discounts on the best Amazon perfumes right now—we're talking up to 50 percent off designer fragrances I've never seen dip below 20 percent off before. And that's the thing: Amazon's perfume assortment is pretty vast. There's a affordable fragrances from brands like Sol De Janeiro (which is currently all 20 percent off right now) and Dossier (currently all 20 percent off as well), but there's also celebrity perfumes like Sabrina Carpenter Fragrance (20 percent off!) and the iconic Carolina Herrera Good Girl (20 percent off—like it's wild!!) . There are fancy eau de parfums, body sprays, hair perfumes—legit everything to also make you the best-smelling person of your friend group.

The inclusion of different-sized ear tips is great, as the ability to pick the size makes these much more comfortable than the regular AirPods. The case size is slightly larger than regular AirPods, but the fact that it has the internal lanyard loop will make you save space when selecting a case.

The scent of summer has found its way into Amazon's biggest sale of the year, and beauty lovers everywhere are buzzing. Sol de Janeiro's Brazilian Bum Bum Cream Set is one of the most talked-about Prime Day steals — and for good reason. For 20% off during Amazon Prime Day, this cult-favorite body care bundle is being scooped up by fans and first-time buyers alike (as it should be). It's not your typical moisturizer, either. It's a full-blown trip to your piña-colada-sipping tropical resort. In short, it's an experience, wrapped in a golden jar and sealed with buttery bliss. For those unfamiliar with the phenomenon, Brazilian Bum Bum Cream is a rich, fast-absorbing body moisturizer powered by guaraná extract — an Amazonian plant packed with caffeine. After reviewing practically the entire brand, I can attest that this holy-grail item is worth the hype. The formula also features cupuaçu butter and coconut oil, ingredients known for their skin-softening properties. But beyond the hydration benefits, it's the fragrance that turns first-time users into lifelong devotees: warm pistachio, salted caramel and vanilla notes linger on the skin for hours, making it as much a perfume as a lotion. Prime Day kicked off on July 8 and lasts until July 11, and this set is definitely one of the best Prime Day beauty deals offered right now. The celebrity seal of approval has only fueled the frenzy. Blake Lively, Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber are among the high-profile names who've made this cream a mainstay in their skincare routines. The set being offered on Amazon includes not only the standard-size cream but also travel-friendly companions that enhance the fragrance and hydration experience. So yes, I'll be shopping this two-piece set and be taking the graceful mini on my Hawaiian honeymoon this September. Layering the cream with its matching body mist or shower gel intensifies the signature Cheirosa '62 scent and makes the daily routine feel like a spa-worthy escape. If you love indulgent scents, smooth skin, and that golden-hour glow, this is your moment. While it's 20% off, I can say with full certainty that this twin pack is the most dynamic duo Prime Day has to offer. Use promo code NYPOSTAB10 to save 10% on top of Prime Day deals.

You work hard, so you deserve nice things. And if you don't work hard, well, who am I to judge? Everyone's earned a lil' treat, in my humble opinion. Whether it's a completely unnecessary bottle of hand sanitizer you impulse-buy at checkout (despite having a personal stockpile rattling around in your bag) or a quick online shopping break during work hours just to feel something, I fully support it. A “lil' treat” can be anything, really. It's how we cope in the modern world (have you seen the news?) .

There's also the Sol de Janeiro hair mist and body spray, which smells like a beach vacation, and a silky Kitsch satin pillowcase that promises to help protect your hair — all discounted and mostly priced between $10 and $30. LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask $16.80 $24.00 30% off Buy Now On Amazon But let's be clear: a lil' treat (noun) is not limited to what's on this list.

Kiehls Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil 5.9 oz $28.50$38.0025% offBuy Now On Amazon A gentle but effective cleansing oil.

This formula is packed with botanical oils that work gently to remove dirt, makeup and grime from the epidermis without leaving a greasy residue. Say hello to soft and supple skin. Squalane beefs up the formula by replenishing the skin's barrier. Simply lather a few pumps of the product onto the face, working in circular motions before washing away with water. Simple as that.

But don't be discouraged, there are still tons of great items at unbeatable prices ready to make their way into your cart and then your home. As commerce writers, we spend a lot of time tracking down the best possible prices on the goods our readers love. Prime Day is our time to shine, and we're not ready to let it go. From everyday essentials to larger splurges, we've shopped slowly and carefully to discern if a sale offers the most bang for your buck. Knowing when to spring for a deal is our superpower, and sharing it with you, well that's just the icing on top. Ahead, we've rounded up only the most worthwhile deals that you can get still during Amazon Prime Day 2025, across every single category and price point. The sales are ending soon, so if you spot an item you've been eyeing at a price that's even more enticing — we recommend snagging it right away. Below are the most wallet-friendly markdowns we discovered at the end of Prime Day, including rare deals on Kindle e-readers, an $8 bathmat that readers bought in droves, luxury skincare and tons of great home cleaning needs. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. The 'Instant Face Lift' cream for smoothing mature skin (44% off) We write quite a bit about mature skincare here at HuffPost, so when we spot a highly-rated firming lotion that's new to us and at a great price, we have to share. Enter: this “Instant Facelift” cream made with retinol, collagen and hyaluronic acid. From the brand Snfajohe, it's currently 44% off. Reviewers say it's a fast-absorbing, lightweight formula that brings fairly quick tightening and glowing results. Celebrated for not being greasy or sticky, the cream helps make skin softer and smoother. Reviewers are literally singing this formula's praises. “From the first application, I noticed my skin looking firmer and more hydrated,” one review wrote. ” ...I've tried many anti-aging creams, but this one truly stands out. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a real difference in their skincare routine!” A sporty-cool polo shirt for beating sunshine, heat and sweat (up to 57% off list price) Freshly marked down up to 57% off (depending on color and size, of course), this Adidas polo shirt is the ultimate summer-ready top. For one, it sports (heh) the brand's Climacool technology, which claims to keep you dry and cool in hot weather. This top is meant for tennis, so it has split seams for extra mobility and ventilated fabric that also wicks moisture, but who says you can't wear it on a casual weekend out? Grab it in men's sizes XS-XXL in one of four colors. The Pink Stuff bundle (15% off) The Pink Stuff is a longtime fan favorite around here for it's ability to clean seemingly anything. This six-piece bundle gives you the classic paste, a multi-purpose spray, a bathroom foam spray and three sponges. Promising review: ""Love it !!!! My stove is so clean from the paste. Smells good. Sprayed and foamed up and cleaned my toilets and showers. Shower shined."" — Kayla Chewable tablets for Fido's itchy, itchy allergies (36% off list price) Even dogs hate seasonal allergies, so if you find Fido sneezing, scratching and paw-licking a little more than usual, consider grabbing this pack of soft chews while it's 36% off for Prime Day. This 180-chew jar is loaded with colostrum, licorice and ginger root and omega 3 to relieve seasonal allergies and beautify that skin and coat. It's also peanut butter flavored, so he'll have zero idea it's to help with those flakes. Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum cream (20% off list price) The Sol de Janeiro Bum Bum cream catapulted to cult status several years ago for its custardy and nourishing formula and a lasting fragrance that's gourmand, nutty and ultra-cozy. It's made with caffeine-rich guarana to help visibly smooth and tighten skin while cupuacu butter delivers deep hydration. Kindle E-Readers back on sale for the first time since 2024! (23% off) You read that right! This well-rated Kindle e-reader hasn't been marked down since the holiday season of LAST YEAR, so you'll wanna move on this quickly.

Instagram/selenagomez Among the over 40,000 five-star Amazon reviews, one fan wrote, “It smells like summer in a jar and the scent actually lingers, in the best way. It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin feeling incredibly smooth, soft, and lightly glowing.” A second devotee wrote, “This cream isn't just another moisturizer — it's a luxurious, tropical treat that truly transforms your skin.
