Hoy buscamos algo que respete la fibra capilar, que dé forma sin frizz, que abrace la textura natural sin dejarla tiesa, y que además repare. En ese escenario nace el Olaplex Nº. 10 Bond Shaper®, un producto que no solo moldea tus rizos, sino que trabaja desde adentro para reconstruir los enlaces rotos del cabello. Si has oído hablar del “sistema de reparación molecular” de Olaplex, sabrás que no es una marca más: es una revolución en la industria capilar, con fórmulas patentadas que han cambiado la forma de tratar el cabello dañado. Y su Nº. 10 no se queda atrás: es el primer gel definidor de rizos con tecnología reparadora Bond Building. Lo que hace especial a este gel no es solo su acabado brillante, ni su capacidad de definir ondas sin apelmazarlas. Es su ingrediente estrella: el Bis-Aminopropyl Diglycol Dimaleate, el complejo molecular exclusivo de Olaplex, que reconecta los enlaces de disulfuro dañados por coloración, calor o maltrato físico. Pero no solo eso: aporta fijación flexible sin rigidez, elimina el frizz incluso con humedad alta, aumenta la elasticidad del rizo y mejora su memoria y proporciona brillo sin residuos ni acartonamiento. La textura es ligera, se funde con el cabello húmedo o seco, y no deja residuos pegajosos. Es ideal tanto para rizos tipo 2B como para 4C. En pruebas realizadas por usuarios: El 87 % notó rizos más definidos y suaves después de una sola aplicación. El 94 % dijo tener menos frizz tras 48 horas. El 91 % sintió el cabello más saludable con el uso constante durante dos semanas. Centella asiática: el secreto coreano que te deja piel de porcelana, ahora en Amazon     El corrector de NYX en Amazon: skincare, maquillaje y revolución suave por 8 euros     Ultimate Shadow Palette de Amazon: 16 razones para cancelar las sombras aburridas Además, su fragancia sutil y limpia lo convierte en una experiencia sensorial que acompaña el ritual de cuidado, no lo invade. Frente a gels convencionales de 10 o 15 euros que ofrecen solo fijación temporal (y muchas veces resecan), el Olaplex Nº. 10 es un híbrido que trata, embellece y protege.

Esa es exactamente la sensación que reproduce el Silky Glow Baked Bronzer 01 de KIKO Milano, una joya low cost que ha ganado espacio entre los imprescindibles del maquillaje diario. Y no, no necesitas vacaciones ni un filtro de Instagram para lograrlo. Por solo 11 euros en Amazon, este bronzer horneado reúne todo lo que buscamos: pigmento modulable, textura suave como terciopelo y un acabado natural que simula ese glow saludable y veraniego. Este producto se ha colado en tutoriales de TikTok, reseñas en YouTube y listas de favoritos en blogs de belleza por una razón clara: es bueno, bonito y barato. Pero además, tiene algo que los expertos valoran más que nunca: versatilidad y efecto realista. Tono universal: el tono 01 aporta ese dorado sutil, sin subtonos naranjas ni efecto “polvo sobre polvo”. Perfecto para pieles claras a medias, y modulable en pieles más profundas. Textura baked: no reseca, no marca poros ni genera parches. Se funde con la piel como un velo ligero. Acabado glow sin shimmer excesivo: es un glow “caro”. Ese que parece natural, que imita el rebote de la luz en tu piel. Más allá del color, lo que enamora es su fórmula horneada enriquecida con aceites emolientes, que hacen que aplicar este bronzer sea casi terapéutico. Se desliza fácil, se difumina sin esfuerzo y no acartona. ¿Tu piel necesita reset? Esta crema sueca es el botón de reinicio, ahora en Amazon     El acondicionador bifásico de 5 euros que te desenreda el pelo y la vida, está en Amazon     Seis euros, un milagro capilar y cero grasa: así actúa el No. 6 de Olaplex en Amazon No es casualidad que muchas comparen este producto con opciones mucho más caras, pero lo cierto es que el de KIKO Milano no intenta imitar a nadie: simplemente entiende lo que la piel necesita hoy. Mientras las fórmulas mates y pesadas del pasado han quedado atrás, ahora buscamos ese acabado tipo “clean girl makeup” o “effortless glow”, inspirado en modelos como Kaia Gerber o Lily Aldridge. Menos es más, pero tiene que verse bien. Este bronzer es parte de ese nuevo paradigma: lujo silencioso, con resultados visibles y un precio amable. ¿Vale la pena? Por 11 euros, absolutamente. Sobre todo si consideramos que se trata de un producto multitarea, que transforma la piel opaca en un rostro vibrante sin esfuerzo ni necesidad de técnica profesional. Además, al ser baked y pigmentado, te durará meses, incluso con uso frecuente. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]Hay algo casi cinematográfico en el verano: la piel besada por el sol, los hombros al descubierto, las mejillas ligeramente doradas como recién salidas de un barco en la costa amalfitana.

If you've been thinking about a cosmetics change-up, now's your chance to do away with worn-out make-up brushes and dried-out mascaras. Amazon has put on a feast of beauty reductions for 2025, and I'm already seeing top-tier discounts across Korean skincare, ghd hair straighteners and more.

Think: Elemis, CeraVe and Color Wow, to name just a few. As IndyBest's resident beauty writer, I've been busy scouring Amazon for the very best discounts. I'm looking for trending products, tried and tested icons and killer deals – there'll be no 10 per cent let downs here. Scroll on for my top picks. Follow live: The top Amazon Prime Day deals Why you can trust IndyBest coverage of the best beauty deals in Amazon's Prime Day sale As seasoned shopping experts here at the IndyBest, we certainly know a thing or two about what makes a good deal. We've been writing about sales – Amazon Prime Day included – for years, and can spot a great discount. My experience as a beauty expert (having tried and tested myriad products) means I can help you make informed decisions about the products you're considering snapping up in the sale. If you're on the lookout for a new blusher, hair oil or LED face mask, you know where to turn. Best early Amazon Prime Day beauty deals Elizabeth Arden eight hour cream skin protectant original for face and body: Was £31, now £15.39, Amazon.co.uk Elemis pro-collagen cleansing balm: Was £49, now £35.28, Amazon.co.uk Color Wow dreamcoat spray: Was £27, now £16, Amazon.co.uk Maybelline New York lash sensational sky high mascara: Was £12.99, now £7.49, Amazon.co.uk CeraVe hydrating cleanser for normal to dry skin: Was £12.50, now £8.75, Amazon.co.uk Elemis pro-collagen cleansing balm: Was £49, now £35.28, Amazon.co.uk The Elemis pro-collagen cleansing balm is about as luxurious as make-up removal gets, using a unique blend of algae and essential oils to restore and deeply nourish skin. Its heavenly scent offers a spa experience at home. Skincare expert has used it for years, and when reviewing it, she found it “a swift and efficacious way to remove make-up.” With 30 per cent off for Amazon Prime Day, now's a better time than ever to give your end-of-day cleanse an upgrade. I'm adding it to my basket now. Olaplex no.6 bond smoother: Was £28, now £19.50, Amazon.co.uk A great multi-purpose pick, Olaplex's no 6 formula works instantly. What's more, it can be applied to wet or dry hair and, as global IndyBest editor noted in her review, “it's a really great leave-in repairing treatment that made our locks feel a lot healthier and more manageable.” Reduced by more than £10 today, it's an easy solution for high-gloss, hydrated hair. Maybelline sky high lash sensation mascara: Was £12.99, now £7.49, Amazon.co.uk Maybelline's sky high lash sensational mascara is one of my favourite budget-friendly mascaras. But I'm not the only one to love it. In her review, IndyBest assistant editor found that her “eyelashes instantly looked lengthened and lifted, and most impressively, stayed that way all day.” This isn't the lowest-ever price it's been, but there's more than 40 per cent off. Color Wow dream coat: Was £32, now £16, Amazon.co.uk A non-negotiable step in my haircare regimen, Color Wow's dream coat anti-frizz treatment is a reliable way to keep my hair looking sleek, smooth and static-free. In my review, I loved that the formula kept my hair straight and added some serious shine and gloss, even after a day in the rain. Elizabeth Arden eight hour cream skin protectant original for face and body: Was £31, now £15.39, Amazon.co.uk A real handbag essential, I take my original eight hour cream everywhere with me, and use it for everything, be it dry cuticles or chapped lips. The balm smells like the inside of a luxury spa, and the texture is somewhere between a petroleum jelly and a thick cleansing balm, coming together to feel deeply nourishing.

Best early Amazon Prime Day beauty deals Elizabeth Arden eight hour cream skin protectant original for face and body: Was £31, now £15.39, Amazon.co.uk Elemis pro-collagen cleansing balm: Was £49, now £35.28, Amazon.co.uk Color Wow dreamcoat spray: Was £27, now £16, Amazon.co.uk Maybelline New York lash sensational sky high mascara: Was £12.99, now £7.49, Amazon.co.uk CeraVe hydrating cleanser for normal to dry skin: Was £12.50, now £8.75, Amazon.co.uk Elemis pro-collagen cleansing balm: Was £49, now £35.28, Amazon.co.uk The Elemis pro-collagen cleansing balm is about as luxurious as make-up removal gets, using a unique blend of algae and essential oils to restore and deeply nourish skin. Its heavenly scent offers a spa experience at home. Skincare expert Louise Whitbread has used it for years, and when reviewing it, she found it “a swift and efficacious way to remove make-up.” With 30 per cent off for Amazon Prime Day, now's a better time than ever to give your end-of-day cleanse an upgrade. I'm adding it to my basket now. Olaplex no.6 bond smoother: Was £28, now £19.50, Amazon.co.uk A great multi-purpose pick, Olaplex's no 6 formula works instantly. What's more, it can be applied to wet or dry hair and, as global IndyBest editor Eva Waite-Taylor noted in her review, “it's a really great leave-in repairing treatment that made our locks feel a lot healthier and more manageable.” Reduced by more than £10 today, it's an easy solution for high-gloss, hydrated hair.

A non-negotiable step in my haircare regimen, Color Wow's dream coat anti-frizz treatment is a reliable way to keep my hair looking sleek, smooth and static-free. In my review, I loved that the formula kept my hair straight and added some serious shine and gloss, even after a day in the rain. Elizabeth Arden eight hour cream skin protectant original for face and body: Was £31, now £15.39, Amazon.co.uk A real handbag essential, I take my original eight hour cream everywhere with me, and use it for everything, be it dry cuticles or chapped lips. The balm smells like the inside of a luxury spa, and the texture is somewhere between a petroleum jelly and a thick cleansing balm, coming together to feel deeply nourishing. If there's one product worth your money this Amazon Prime Day, it's this. Garnier ambre solair ultra-light sensitive sun protection face fluid SPF50+: Was £13, now £6.29, Amazon.co.uk The best budget face SPF just got even cheaper thanks to the discount. The perfect pocket-sized sun cream is a great option for on-the-go application this summer. Our IndyBest tester trusted this SPF wholeheartedly as it protects from both UVB, UVA and long UVA rays. As for the “lightweight lotion” formula, it “instantly absorbs into the skin, while hyaluronic acid and vitamin E give that hit of hydration”, she found....","The Independent's journalism is supported by our readers.

mov_B3160C60A7C091B068ED79747FF8D337,"  I've been waiting for an excuse to upgrade my ageing Kindle — and this Prime Day deal on the newest Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (16GB) has me ready to pounce. At £134.99 (down from £169.99), the price is spot on for summer, and everything about it feels like it was made for the kind of reading I plan to do on my upcoming holiday. I made a quiet resolution in January to read more this year — and, to my surprise, I've kept at it. But my trusty old Kindle (at least six years old, maybe more) has started to show its age: page turns feel sluggish, the screen's not as crisp as I'd like, and the battery barely makes it through a long weekend, let alone two solid weeks. This new Paperwhite seems to answer all of that and then some. Amazon calls it their fastest Kindle ever, with a next-gen 7-inch glare-free screen, 25% faster page turns, and weeks — not days — of battery life on a single USB-C charge. That's exactly what I want: to load it up with a hundred books, pop it in my hand luggage, and forget about charging it while I get lost in story after story. It's also waterproof, ultra-thin, and completely free of the social media distractions you get from tablets and phones. Add to that a warm light option for night reading and a massive Kindle Store library (plus Kindle Unlimited if you like), and it feels like a solid investment in my reading habit.

I've been waiting for an excuse to upgrade my ageing Kindle — and this Prime Day deal on the newest Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (16GB) has me ready to pounce. At £134.99 (down from £169.99), the price is spot on for summer, and everything about it feels like it was made for the kind of reading I plan to do on my upcoming holiday. I made a quiet resolution in January to read more this year — and, to my surprise, I've kept at it. But my trusty old Kindle (at least six years old, maybe more) has started to show its age: page turns feel sluggish, the screen's not as crisp as I'd like, and the battery barely makes it through a long weekend, let alone two solid weeks. Read More This new Paperwhite seems to answer all of that and then some. Amazon calls it their fastest Kindle ever, with a next-gen 7-inch glare-free screen, 25% faster page turns, and weeks — not days — of battery life on a single USB-C charge. That's exactly what I want: to load it up with a hundred books, pop it in my hand luggage, and forget about charging it while I get lost in story after story. It's also waterproof, ultra-thin, and completely free of the social media distractions you get from tablets and phones. Add to that a warm light option for night reading and a massive Kindle Store library (plus Kindle Unlimited if you like), and it feels like a solid investment in my reading habit.

I've been waiting for an excuse to upgrade my ageing Kindle — and this Prime Day deal on the newest Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (16GB) has me ready to pounce. At £134.99 (down from £169.99), the price is spot on for summer, and everything about it feels like it was made for the kind of reading I plan to do on my upcoming holiday. I made a quiet resolution in January to read more this year — and, to my surprise, I've kept at it. But my trusty old Kindle (at least six years old, maybe more) has started to show its age: page turns feel sluggish, the screen's not as crisp as I'd like, and the battery barely makes it through a long weekend, let alone two solid weeks. This new Paperwhite seems to answer all of that and then some. Amazon calls it their fastest Kindle ever, with a next-gen 7-inch glare-free screen, 25% faster page turns, and weeks — not days — of battery life on a single USB-C charge. That's exactly what I want: to load it up with a hundred books, pop it in my hand luggage, and forget about charging it while I get lost in story after story. It's also waterproof, ultra-thin, and completely free of the social media distractions you get from tablets and phones. Add to that a warm light option for night reading and a massive Kindle Store library (plus Kindle Unlimited if you like), and it feels like a solid investment in my reading habit. Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (16GB) – Without Ads – Black Buy now for £134.99 at Amazon For anyone who's made — or wants to make — reading a bigger part of their life this summer, this is a deal worth grabbing while it lasts. £499.00 If you've been putting up with a sluggish laptop or cluttered desktop setup, now's the perfect time to upgrade — and the Apple Mac mini M4 makes it easy. Compact yet incredibly powerful, this tiny 5x5-inch machine packs Apple's latest M4 chip, 16GB of unified memory and a 10-core CPU and GPU, letting you breeze through demanding apps and multitasking without a hitch.

Amazon Prime Day is here, offering discounts on beauty and wellness items during the four-day sale, exclusive to Prime members. You can also find deals on tech, kitchen appliances, household essentials and more. I frequently cover shopping events like Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday as a writer for NBC Select, so I know how to find deals that are actually worth buying. I spent weeks combing through thousands of discounts to find the best Prime Day beauty deals — each one I recommend below is highly rated, at least 20% off and at its lowest price in at least three months. I'll frequently update this list throughout Prime Day. Selected.Our top picks You can use this teeth whitening kit — which is an NBC Select Wellness Award winner — to gently remove both old and new stains in as little as two weeks, according to the brand. Each pack comes with 18 treatments, all of which use enamel-safe hydrogen peroxide as the key whitening ingredient. Lowest Price Ever This Laneige lip mask is one of our absolute favorites — it has oils, butters and antioxidants to hydrate and protect your lips overnight. Our editors love that it keeps their lips feeling soft and moisturized, and say it's great for soothing irritation and dryness in the wintertime. You can use this viral shower oil to cleanse your skin in the shower and even replace your shaving cream. It has hydrating sweet almond oil, which gives it a vanilla-almond scent that NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio says is not too overpowering. Lowest Price Ever The Dyson Airwrap has three attachments that allow you to blow dry, curl and volumize your hair, according to the brand. It also has three airflow speeds and three heat settings, along with a cooling “cold shot” feature. Former “The Traitors” star Dorinda Medley told us she loves using these wipes to take off her makeup on the go. The disposable wipes are infused with micellar water to help you remove makeup, oil, bacteria and more without pulling or tugging, according to the brand. There are two packs, which have 25 wipes each. Olaplex's products are my favorites to use on wash days, and this kit has everything you need to get through an entire routine. It includes full sizes of the No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo, the No.5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner and the No.7 Bonding Oil, all of which hydrate, detangle and nourish hair by repairing damaged hair bonds, according to the brand. Sun Bum's Daily Face sunscreen made the top five on our 100 best sunscreens ranking, and this body spray version has the same broad-spectrum SPF 50 protection. It has vitamin E to moisturize your skin, plus it's noncomedogenic, which means it won't clog your pores. It's also water-resistant and reef-safe, making it ideal for a day at the beach. This body wash has glycerin to protect skin from dryness and provide moisture that lasts all day, according to the brand. The gentle, gel formula makes it great for sensitive skin. It's available in a variety of scents and has easy-to-use pump packaging. This moisturizer is fragrance-free, gentle and absorbs quickly into the skin. It has ceramides and niacinamide to hydrate skin, and layers well underneath makeup. A little also goes a long way with this moisturizer — NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin says that since she doesn't need to use a lot at a time, the tube tends to last a while. Malin uses the curly-hair version of this anti-frizz spray daily, and says it smooths out her curls while locking in definition. The heat-activated polymers in the spray protect your hair from moisture, preventing frizz and helping your hairstyle stay shiny, healthy and intact, according to the brand.

Amazon Prime Day is here, and one of the most buzzed-about beauty steals of the event is the COLOR WOW Dream Coat Supernatural Spray £16 (41% off the normal price £28). This award-winning, multi-tasking styling product has built a cult following for one reason: it delivers sleek, glassy, frizz-proof hair that lasts for days no matter the weather. What sets Dream Coat apart is that it's not just another anti-frizz spray. It's the first all-season, weatherproofing powerhouse that encapsulates hair in an imperceptible anti-humidity, anti-static jacket. This unique formulation completely transforms the look and feel of hair's texture. Think of it as an “invisible cloak” with magical, moisture-resistant powers that last for up to three days straight. No stiffness, no buildup, just silky, smooth, mirror-like shine. COLOR WOW Dream Coat Supernatural Spray Read More Celebrity hairstylist Chris Appleton - whose clients include Kim Kardashian, Jennifer Lopez and Sofia Vergara - swears by it. The celebrity hair stylist previously said he used over 100 bottles a year. You might want to buy it now before he stocks up in the Prime Day deal. The spray is heat-activated, which means results are locked in when you blow-dry with tension after application. Once activated, the sleek finish doesn't wash out immediately; it stays put through up to three or four shampoos. And despite its high performance, the formula is incredibly lightweight. There's no sticky residue, no greasy coating, just a smooth, sealed finish that repels frizz, humidity, and static. It's rare to see such a universally loved, stylist-approved product go on sale, which makes now the perfect time to stock up. How to use: If you've ever struggled with frizz or flat, dull strands that won't hold a sleek finish, Dream Coat could easily become your new go-to.

Now, as someone who was every shade of blonde at one stage, including platinum, I tended to rely on the iconic Olaplex brand to help keep my hair looking healthy, shiny and less frizzy at the ends. However, last year I decided to branch out with the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment that had attracted numerous TikTok videos and glowing reviews from shoppers who billed it as a ""miracle worker."" Read more: 'Sultry' Ghost perfume that 'suits all ages' now under £14 in Prime Day sale Read more: 'I tried a viral K-beauty serum for a week and my skin has never been glowier' That's not all, as for those who are obsessed with celebrity beauty secrets, this hair treatment is used by the current 'it' pop superstar of the moment Sabrina Carpenter, with the 'Espresso' hitmaker now a global ambassador for the Redken brand. To sweeten the deal even further, not only did I find this conditioner to be a ""lifesaver"" for damaged hair, but it's currently on offer for 32 percent less in the Amazon Prime Day sale, reduced from £26.40 to just £17.99 - and I am tempted to stock up for that price. For the beauty fans who are keen to take advantage of the Amazon deal, but aren't sure if the Bonding Treatment is right for them, I have provided below my full thoughts on when I first trialled it last year. ""Despite what you might think, I didn't run into this review with high expectations. I have used Olaplex in the past, which has helped the condition of my hair, but other products on the market don't tend to work well. Trust me, I have tried a lot. ""So, when I brought the Redken Leave-In Treatment on Amazon Prime Day, alongside the Pre-Shampoo Treatment, I decided to try and keep a level head. There's nothing worse than being disappointed, am I right? ""That being said, when I first popped this treatment on my damp ends, my first thought was that it seemed quite heavy, and I worried it would make my hair greasy. I couldn't have been more wrong, because like many reviews mentioned, a little goes a long way. ""I only needed just larger than a pea size amount to coat my lengths and ends evenly, and it melted in without weighing my fine hair down, unlike many other leave-in conditioners."" ""Considering many reviews and videos on TikTok say this treatment left their hair ""visibly healthier"" immediately, I was genuinely surprised to find myself agreeing with them. ""The first time I used the leave-in treatment, I used it alongside the pre-shampoo treatment and my hair felt smoother, with less tangles for my comb to snarl through. As soon as I blow dried my hair with the treatment in, I could notice that the broken, damaged ends of my hair were visibly smoother and a little shinier as well. ""Long gone were the gnarled looking straggly ends, and in their place was smooth, shiny hair that looked as though it had never been touched by any damage. Honestly, as someone who struggles with her fine hair, I was immediately surprised at the magic. ""After using the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment during my hair wash days in the week, I noticed that my hair doesn't look as damaged. ""Even though I've used it a few times now, the bottle still feels full, which is insane value for money. Considering my thin hair can go through products like crazy due to its weaker nature, I think that this treatment will be a staple that will save me cash in the long run. ""It's not just saving me money, as my hair genuinely feels softer and less fragile since I began using it. While it's no replacement for a good salon visit to cut off the dead ends, it's certainly a miracle worker in between appointments that has helped save my over processed hair to look, leaving it in much better condition."" Purchase my new go-to hair hero the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment for 32 percent less in the Amazon Prime Day event now. For a few alternatives worth trying out, I would still personally recommend the Olaplex No.6 Bond Smoother that is also on offer on Amazon for £19.80, down from £28. Over at Boots, one shoppers also say is a good option is the L'Oréal Paris Elvive Bond Repair Leave-In Serum that costs £16.99.","Bond treatments are all the rage in the world of haircare.

mov_EB49A73F402A85E592FEE96F896962DE,"  If you regularly dye, blow dry, straighten, or curl your hair, chances are that your locks are slightly (or maybe more than slightly) damaged. These common hair practices can all lead to weak strands, breakage, frizz, split ends, and more, and once the damage is done, it can be hard to fix. However, all hope isn't lost quite yet: It possible to repair damaged hair, making it look vibrant and healthy again, if you have the right products. One of the top-recommended hair repair treatments is Olaplex No. 3 Hair Perfector, a pre-wash treatment that you leave in for several minutes before showering. This hair product has legions of fans, and it's currently available at its lowest price of the year. If you're struggling with dried, fried, or otherwise damaged hair, this is one Amazon Prime Day deal you won't want to miss. The cult-favorite Olaplex No. 3 is currently 30% off, bringing its price down to just $21. Thousands of reviewers — myself included — swear that this formula is the key to reviving damaged hair, and if you've been wanting to try it out for yourself, there's no better time to grab a bottle (or two!) . Olaplex No. 3 is clinically proven to help reverse hair damage after just a single use, helping to improve your hair's strength, texture, and appearance. $21 at Amazon Why is this a good deal? Olaplex products work phenomenally, but they are definitely a splurge. The No. 3 formula typically retails for $30 for a 3.3-ounce bottle, and it rarely goes on sale. For Prime Day, this beloved hair repair treatment is marked down 30%, bringing its price to just $21 — the lowest we've seen all year. Why do I need this? If your hair is looking dull or frizzy due to damage, Olaplex No. 3 is arguably the best way to restore it. The product is designed to be put in damp hair, and you let it soak in for up to 10 minutes before rinsing it out. (Many people choose to apply it before their shower, then wash their hair as usual.) In just a few minutes, the formula is able to strengthen your hair — the brand explains that it repairs damage on a molecular level by rebuilding the disulfide bonds that give hair its strength. This will make your hair look smoother and less textured, and it should also be easier to detangle after washing. The product also helps to prevent future breakage, and you'll start seeing results after the very first use. No. 3 can be used on all types of hair, and it only needs to be applied once a week. What reviewers say Olaplex No. 3 has been clinically tested, but it also has thousands of avid fans who swear by the formula. In fact, Amazon says that more than 100,000 shoppers have purchased the hair treatment multiple times — so you know it works! ✅ Pros If you're skeptical about how well Olaplex No. 3 works, the glowing reviews will definitely put your worries to rest: “My hair? Fried. Frizzed. Emotionally unstable. It had seen things — bleach, box dye, questionable heat styling decisions — and it was holding a grudge,” writes one ecstatic reviewer. “Enter this little miracle worker. Olaplex No. 3 is worth the hype! It's a bond-builder, which sounds like something from a superhero movie, and honestly, that's the energy it brings. This is the closest thing to an apology your strands will ever get from you.” Older reviewers also love the formula, saying it makes their hair look much younger and healthier: “It is the fountain of youth for your hair,” explains a self-described skeptic. “Mine now looks and feels as good as it did over 20 years ago. Thick. Shiny. Soft. Bouncy. Gorgeous.” Many reviewers also say this product comes recommended by their hairdressers: “My hair is overly dry, brittle, and unable to manage because of the damage from highlighting,” says another repeat buyer. “I was absolutely hating my hair, to tears. My hairdresser suggested that I try this. It has made all the difference. My hair is shiny, feels healthier, and I have confidence again.” ⚠️ Cons One of the biggest downsides of this product is that it comes in a small 3.3-ounce bottle, and you may go through it quickly if you have long or thick hair: “This worked well when using it with Olaplex No. 4 and 5, but the bottle is so small, I only got four uses out of it,” says another reviewer....","If you regularly dye, blow dry, straighten, or curl your hair, chances are that your locks are slightly (or maybe more than slightly) damaged.

Prime Day isn't the only sale in town this week Amazon's Prime Day dominance is facing serious competition this week, with major retailers launching their own sales events to capture shoppers who want deals without the Prime membership requirement. The strategy isn't new, but the scale and coordination of these competing sales has reached new levels, creating a week-long shopping bonanza that extends far beyond Amazon's ecosystem. Smart shoppers know that the best deals might not always be found on Amazon, making it worth checking multiple retailers before hitting “buy now.” Here are some of the best deals around the internet this week, just before Prime Day kicks off on July 8. Dyson: Summer Savings Event Dyson rarely discounts its products significantly, making this summer event particularly noteworthy for anyone considering a premium vacuum, hair product or air purifier. Featured deals include savings on Dyson's lightest intelligent cordless vacuum with up to 60 minutes of run time, or the Airwrap styling tool that creates curls at the touch of a button with no heat damage.

Here's everything you need to know about the annual summer sale When did Amazon Prime Day 2024 start in the US? Amazon Prime Day is underway. And, as a shopping editor who has covered the retailer's sales for more than five years, it's safe to say I know how to spot a good deal from a dud. I'd always recommend using price comparison tools to make sure you're getting the best possible price, but I can confidently say some of the best deals see big-ticket products plummet to their lowest-ever price. Apple's AirPods Pro 2, for example, have been reduced by $100 to just $149, making them cheaper than their Black Friday price. And both Dyson's top-rated air purifier and Yeti's tumbler are now cheaper than ever. There are also impressive savings on Ninja air fryers, robot vacuums, CeraVe beauty products, and gaming devices. For the first ever year, the summer sale is running for four full days, but when will it end? Keep scrolling for answers to all of your burning questions, as well as a handpicked selection of the best deals across tech, appliances, beauty, and more. When did Amazon Prime Day 2024 start in the US? Amazon kicked off its Prime Day sale on July 8 at midnight. For the first year, the Amazon Prime Day sale will run for four days. Amazon Prime Day ends on July 11. From experience, the deals tend to stay the same for the duration of the event. But big-ticket items such as AirPods or games consoles do have a tendency to sell out before the end of the sales event. Is Prime Day only for Prime members? Yes, Prime Day is a celebration of Amazon's Prime members, so you'll actually need to be a Prime member to secure all the deals. Amazon Prime costs $14.99 per month or $139 per year. But there is a way around paying for the subscription. If you're not already a Prime member, you might be eligible for a free 30-day trial of Prime. It's only available to Amazon customers who have never been a Prime member before or haven't been a Prime member in the last 12 months. If you're between the ages of 18 and 22, you can also get an even longer six-month free trial, as well as half-price memberships, meaning you'll pay just $7.49 instead of $14.99 per month.

When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn commission. Why trust us? Here's everything you need to know about the annual summer sale When did Amazon Prime Day 2024 start in the US? Amazon Prime Day is underway. And, as a shopping editor who has covered the retailer's sales for more than five years, it's safe to say I know how to spot a good deal from a dud. I'd always recommend using price comparison tools to make sure you're getting the best possible price, but I can confidently say some of the best deals see big-ticket products plummet to their lowest-ever price. Apple's AirPods Pro 2, for example, have been reduced by $100 to just $149, making them cheaper than their Black Friday price. And both Dyson's top-rated air purifier and Yeti's tumbler are now cheaper than ever. There are also impressive savings on Ninja air fryers, robot vacuums, CeraVe beauty products, and gaming devices. For the first ever year, the summer sale is running for four full days, but when will it end? Keep scrolling for answers to all of your burning questions, as well as a handpicked selection of the best deals across tech, appliances, beauty, and more. When did Amazon Prime Day 2024 start in the US? Amazon kicked off its Prime Day sale on July 8 at midnight. For the first year, the Amazon Prime Day sale will run for four days. Amazon Prime Day ends on July 11. From experience, the deals tend to stay the same for the duration of the event. But big-ticket items such as AirPods or games consoles do have a tendency to sell out before the end of the sales event. Is Prime Day only for Prime members? Yes, Prime Day is a celebration of Amazon's Prime members, so you'll actually need to be a Prime member to secure all the deals. Amazon Prime costs $14.99 per month or $139 per year. But there is a way around paying for the subscription. If you're not already a Prime member, you might be eligible for a free 30-day trial of Prime. It's only available to Amazon customers who have never been a Prime member before or haven't been a Prime member in the last 12 months. If you're between the ages of 18 and 22, you can also get an even longer six-month free trial, as well as half-price memberships, meaning you'll pay just $7.49 instead of $14.99 per month.

With active noise cancellation, spatial audio, three silicone tips for customized fit, and over 24 hours of listening time with the included case, the AirPods Pro 2 give you a *ton* of bang for your buck. Promising review: ""Nothing compares. The noise canceling is superior. I fly a lot on the airlines and I don't have to hear screaming babies anymore. I hit the noise canceling and watch my movie or listen to my music.

I cannot believe how amazing this foundation is! Please do not listen to the bad comments, run and buy it and test it yourself! I honestly did not order this sooner because of the bad reviews, but decided to give it a try. I have tried from the most expensive foundations and nothing compares to this one! I had people stop me and ask me what I was wearing. I love the fact that it's all in one simple compact and easy to travel with. I no longer need a brush nor a Beautyblender. Also, this foundation does not need primer or setting spray! All you need is to apply powder to set the foundation. My skin looks flawless, like I have no makeup, full coverage but not cakey, it's super thin like water and covers every little spot. I feel I have a filter.

We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. 40% off (that's $100 off, an all-new lowest price ever!) the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro. With active noise cancellation, spatial audio, three silicone tips for customized fit, and over 24 hours of listening time with the included case, the AirPods Pro 2 give you a *ton* of bang for your buck. Promising review: ""Nothing compares. The noise canceling is superior. I fly a lot on the airlines and I don't have to hear screaming babies anymore. I hit the noise canceling and watch my movie or listen to my music. These are the best earphones I've ever had."" —Patrice Price: $149 (originally $249 (and currently $249 at Apple); typically $189.99 at Amazon) — and shop all the Apple deals here AirPods 4 are also a new lowest price ever — 34% off with noise cancellation (down to $119), 31% off without (down to $89). 2. 60% off (the lowest price ever!) the TikTok-viral TirTir cushion foundation that offers 72 hours of flawless wear, blending seamlessly to hide redness, blemishes, and under-eye bags. It has buildable coverage, perfect for a natural look or full glam. Plus, it's packed with hibiscus and red propolis extracts for a boost in skin elasticity. And to top it all off, its oval-shaped puff can reach every little corner of your face. Check out this TikTok of Mikayla Nogueira's review of this foundation. Promising review: ""OMG! I cannot believe how amazing this foundation is! Please do not listen to the bad comments, run and buy it and test it yourself! I honestly did not order this sooner because of the bad reviews, but decided to give it a try. I have tried from the most expensive foundations and nothing compares to this one! I had people stop me and ask me what I was wearing. I love the fact that it's all in one simple compact and easy to travel with. I no longer need a brush nor a Beautyblender. Also, this foundation does not need primer or setting spray! All you need is to apply powder to set the foundation. My skin looks flawless, like I have no makeup, full coverage but not cakey, it's super thin like water and covers every little spot. I feel I have a filter. My face looks amazing and I will forever wear this, I hope they never discontinue this."" —Anonymous Price: $10 (originally $25, typically $19.99-$25 on Amazon; available in 40 shades and a mini size) — and shop all the TirTir deals here 3. 30% off Olaplex's No. 7 hair-bonding oil that'll provide heat protection (up to 450 degrees) and softness, help reduce frizz, and impart maaaajor shine — without your hair feeling weighed down or greasy. And all with just 2-3 drops! That means you save today *and* this bottle'll last you a long time. Promising review: ""This hair oil is a total game-changer! My hair feels softer, shinier, and healthier after just a few uses. It smells amazing and doesn't feel greasy at all. I've tried so many oils, but this one is by far the best I've ever had....",2025-07-09 15:21:17,en,WEB,,,,11cee48706402441e6ec8a9c0334f8d1,,False,1,True,Affiliate,Medium,True,"- Part of a broader Amazon Prime Day deals roundup

Uno de ellos es ver tus manos impecables, con un esmalte que no se quiebra al segundo café ni desaparece al lavar platos. El OPI Gel con color, esmalte en gel para uñas, una de las fórmulas más profesionales del mercado, ahora está en oferta por solo 20 euros en Amazon gracias al Prime Day. Un precio más que justo por una manicura que dura semanas, brilla como recién hecha y te ahorra citas innecesarias en el salón. OPI no es cualquier marca. Es un nombre que suena en pasarelas, sets de cine y manos de celebridades. Pero más allá de lo aspiracional, ha construido su reputación en una fórmula real: larga duración, pigmentación intensa y un acabado gel que compite con el de los mejores salones profesionales. Su línea GelColor, en particular, es la joya del portafolio, diseñada para brindar ese efecto “recién pintado” por hasta tres semanas. Y ahora, por solo 20 euros, puedes tener ese resultado sin salir de casa. En un mundo donde el tiempo escasea y las prioridades cambian, la manicura en gel casera es un nuevo acto de autonomía. Ya no es solo estética: es una declaración. Te cuidas, te ves bien y lo haces a tu manera. El secreto de este esmalte está en su tecnología de gel semipermanente, que cura bajo lámpara LED y sella el color con un brillo que no se opaca con los días. No hay retoque constante, ni esquinas despostilladas. El color permanece intacto, como si el tiempo no pasara. Y eso, en términos beauty, es casi un superpoder. Seis euros, un milagro capilar y cero grasa: así actúa el No. 6 de Olaplex en Amazon     Cuidado minimalista y efectivo: la crema que los dermatólogos no dejan de recomendar     Protección 360º y cero dramas: así es cuidar la piel atópica bajo el sol, gracias Amazon Además, su paleta de tonos no se queda en lo básico. Desde los nudes sofisticados tipo “your nails but better” hasta rojos icónicos y tonos modernos con carácter, cada color parece tener historia y actitud. Porque en OPI, elegir un tono es también elegir un estado de ánimo. Si eres de las que valora el acabado de salón pero también quiere libertad y practicidad, este esmalte es para ti. Solo necesitas una base, una lámpara LED (que hoy puedes encontrar por menos de lo que cuesta una visita al nail bar) y un poco de paciencia para aplicar en capas finas. El resultado: uñas dignas de portada de revista, hechas por ti. Este Prime Day no es solo una oportunidad para renovar gadgets. Es una invitación a apostar por ti y por esos pequeños gestos de poder personal que elevan tu día a día. El OPI GelColor no es solo un esmalte: es una herramienta de belleza y empoderamiento en clave contemporánea. Por 20 euros, te llevas semanas de brillo profesional, sin prisas, sin citas, sin salir de casa.

If you make a purchase via links on this page we will earn commission - learn more Prime Day is in full swing, and as an editor who's worked more Prime Days than I can count, I think I know what a good deal on Prime Day really is. After spending hours checking out Amazon's Prime Day module, I've found the 10 best deals you can't miss — at some of the best prices they've ever been. From tech to home, here are my editor-approved Prime Day deals worth your buck. Editor-Approved Prime Day Deals grace & stella Retinol Under Eye Patches My go-to for tired eyes, these patches immediately work to depuff and improve the under-eye area. They feel cool to the touch, and actually stay on my under eye area without slipping or falling. You'll get 24 pairs in one pack, and right now they're on sale for a massive 48 percent off. $11.90 (48% off) Shop Crest 3D Whitestrips Every Prime Day, the Crest whitestrips are always on sale, and everyone (inlcuding me) loves to shop them. Whether you have yellowing teeth or just need a quick dental spruce-up, these white strips actually deliver dentist-quality results. Shop now on sale. $29.99 (35% off)  Shop Apple AirPods 2 (2nd Gen) If you're on the hunt for the most popular earbuds, it's Apple AirPods. They have stellar noise cancellation, offer a transparency mode, and come with various ear tips for a customizable fit. They're currently under $200, so it's a great time to shop them now. $149 (40% off)  Shop Swiffer PowerMop Yes, I'm recommending two cleaning products back to back, but the Swiffer Mop is really a game-changer for dirty floors, and it's under $20 right now. The set comes with the mop, cleaning solution, batteries, and refill pads. Shop it now before Prime Day ends. $18.99 (37% off)  Shop Simple Modern 40 oz Trek Tumbler Travel in style with this portable tumbler that keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold. It's cup holder-friendly and even has double insulation — keeping the condensation off its exterior. Shop this Prime Day deal today. $22.79 (35% off) Shop Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil I love Olaplex products — and so do my writers, so really it's whole-team approved. This oil doubles as a heat protectant and returns shine while smoothing visibly dry hair. It's an everyday essential, and right now it's on sale for just $21. $21 (30% off)  Shop Sony WH-1000XM4 Headphones I just tested the latest WH-1000XM6 headphones and rated them a five on five, but the WHXM4 are also a great pair of headphones at their discounted price. They're easy to connect too, feature a lengthy battery life, and decent sound quality. They're loved by thousands on Amazon shoppers and definitely worth a buy $184.99 (47% off)  Shop Dyson Supersonic™ Origin Hair Dryer There's nothing like styling your hair with the iconic Dyson Supersonic. Yes, it's expensive, but it can style virtually any kind of hair and is so much quieter than its competitors.

Kiehls Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil 5.9 oz $28.50$38.0025% offBuy Now On Amazon A gentle but effective cleansing oil. The word oil can be triggering to some, especially those with oily skin. Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil is a cleanser you can trust, with an affordable price tag to boot. It's one you'll want to add to your arsenal for numerous reasons. This formula is packed with botanical oils that work gently to remove dirt, makeup and grime from the epidermis without leaving a greasy residue. Say hello to soft and supple skin. Squalane beefs up the formula by replenishing the skin's barrier. Simply lather a few pumps of the product onto the face, working in circular motions before washing away with water. Simple as that.

We may earn a small commission on items purchased through this article, but that does not affect our editorial judgement. Amazon Prime Day is here, and with it comes a standout deal that's hard to ignore especially if you're someone who struggles with dry, damaged, or over-processed hair. The Olaplex No.3 Hair Perfector Jumbo 250ml is now just £39.55 (original price £56 that's a huge 29% off). It's an amazing price for a product that's rarely on sale. This is a great deal as the normal 30ml sized bottle normally retails in salons for £30 you are getting a lot more product for your money. Olaplex No.3 isn't just another conditioning treatment that smells nice and makes your hair feel soft for a day. It uses a patented bond-building technology that repairs broken hair bonds from the inside out. That means it goes deeper than your typical deep conditioner. For those who regularly bleach, dye, straighten, curl, or just generally live life (sun, wind, heat styling), this product addresses the root of the damage. Olaplex No. 3 Hair Perfector Jumbo 250ml Shop now for £39.55 This isn't about masking damage, it's about fixing it. With a pH balance of 4.0–5.0, it's designed to support the natural acidity of your scalp and hair, allowing it to repair and hydrate without disrupting your hair's ecosystem. The result? Softer, shinier, stronger hair over time. Over 94% of customers who have used the Olaplex Treatment have given it a positive review. One person wrote: “I've been using Olaplex products for years and it's worth every penny.” Another shopper explained: “Great for bleached hair.” The jumbo size bottle (250ml) is perfect for consistent use. This isn't a one-and-done product; regular use (1–2 times per week) gives the best results. So getting more of it, especially at this price, means months of healthy hair maintenance for less than the cost of a single salon treatment. Who is the Olaplex No3 Treatment for? If your hair feels like straw after dyeing or bleaching If you've noticed more breakage or thinning If your curls have lost their shape and spring If heat styling is a regular part of your life Shop more from the haircare brand with the Olaplex No. 5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner £18.90 and Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil £18.55 also in the Prime Day deals.

Pero basta de subestimar el primer paso. Porque si lo que usas para limpiar tu rostro lo irrita, lo reseca o lo intoxica, el resto de tu rutina ya está trabajando en desventaja. Y ahí es donde esta leche limpiadora 99% natural, por solo 16 euros en Amazon durante el Prime Day, entra como un acto de reconciliación con tu piel y con tu lógica. El concepto de “leche limpiadora” puede sonar a ritual vintage, de esos que usaban nuestras madres o abuelas, pero eso no la hace menos vigente. Al contrario: el formato ha evolucionado, pero la lógica sigue siendo impecable. Una buena leche limpiadora —como esta— limpia, desmaquilla, nutre y respeta la barrera cutánea. Todo al mismo tiempo. ¿Y qué hace distinta a esta en particular? Primero, su origen natural: 99% de sus ingredientes vienen de la naturaleza. No hay siliconas disfrazadas, ni perfumes agresivos, ni alcohol que reseca. Solo lo necesario: aceites vegetales, extractos botánicos, emolientes suaves. Y eso, en pieles sensibles, no es un capricho: es supervivencia. El blush rosad de 3 euros que deja efecto Rare Beauty perfecto y sin gastar de más     El fijador de maquillaje viral de Amazon que revive delineadores y ahorra maquillaje     Rizos sin frizz, sin rigidez y con brillo: sí, existe, se llama Olaplex en Amazon Además, su textura es cremosa pero no pesada, lo que permite masajearla con calma, incluso sobre maquillaje cargado. ¿Rímel waterproof? ¿Base full cover? Esta leche los derrite sin restregar, y sin dejar la piel como cartón mojado. El efecto post-limpieza es clave: no tira, no pica, no enrojece. Al contrario, se siente como un primer gesto de autocuidado real, no como un trámite apurado antes de aplicar el siguiente suero. En términos culturales, esta leche representa algo que va más allá de la fórmula. Representa el retorno al skincare sensato, a esa limpieza que no busca dejar la piel “chillando de limpia”, sino cómoda, balanceada, real. En un mercado saturado de activos potentes, exfoliantes químicos y promesas antiage extremas, volver a lo básico es casi radical. Esta leche limpiadora no grita ""tendencia"", pero sí susurra “piel feliz” al oído. Y en una época donde el skincare puede volverse performance, a veces lo más transformador es elegir la opción que no duele, no reseca y no abruma. A 16 euros por Prime Day, no es una ganga.
