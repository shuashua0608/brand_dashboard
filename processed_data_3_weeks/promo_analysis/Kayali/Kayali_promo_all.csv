Here are the Perfumes I currently own/owned and will repurchase: Macaron d'amande by Jeanne arthes : cheap vanilla almond gourmand, great for layering with summery scents. Khair pistachio: I like it its just more sweet than nutty. Would love a recommendation for a nuttier pistachio scent. Delice nacr√©: cheap perfect signature scent. It's clean musky sweet and slightly floral. I hate floral Perfumes but this one is just perfect. (I looked for this EVERYWHERE but couldn't find it only on Amazon for triple the original price:((  i am almost running out) Eclaire: I like it but it's too cloying. Sol de Janeiro 62 : I like it but honestly not worth the price ://. Eilish n1: perfect winter scent I get lots of compliments from it. Based on my current collection please tell me whether these Perfumes would be a good purchase (I love vanilla, plain, sweet, slightly spicy but not too much. I also like gourmand pistachios, caramels ans musky clean scents) I am planning to add to my collection (never smelled any of these): Delice ambr√©: giving that delice nacr√© is my signature scent I thought I would enjoy this too . Kenzo amour. Britney spears intimate fantasy. Latte Abyad. Juliette has a gun vanilla vibes. Kayali Capri in a bottle. Shaghaf oud tonka.

I am scrubbing immediately 2. Very underwhelming, probably would not purchase OR scrubbed but would give a second chance 3. Somewhat enjoyable, didn't scrub, could maybe try this again in the future 4. I am probably going to size up from the sample size, I enjoyed this 5. I love it, full size full size full size **Moon Bathing-** *""Lychee fruit, milk, vanilla, jasmine grandiflorum, salt""* Woah. The freshness/tart of the lychee balances the laconic of the milk and sweetness of the vanilla perfectly. This is a fruity gourmand in the best way possible. The light pink is gorgeous, this song smells like Pink in the Night by Mitski if you've ever heard it. I do not smell the salt but maybe it's just what's contributing to the ‚Äútart‚Äù of the lychee which I adore. As time progresses you can kind of get that floral in the background too. Which I would usually say I could do without but here it builds a solid base. Vibes are definitely light, delicate, fem, fruity, youthful but reserved, clean 4.5/5 **Parakeet-** *""Fizzy grapefruit soda, freshly picked daisies, tiny forget-me-nots, and the powdery sweet down feathers of a well groomed parakeet""* Omg why am I slowly coming to realize I love tart?! This smells like a Sweetart/tart candy to me. I think it's the grapefruit that does this. It's very beautiful and summer ish! This is what I would imagine that very pricey Odette fragrance with the swan on it smells like. However, I really do wish the dry down was as effervescent and pretty as the opening. You do still get hits of that grapefruit throughout, but it does become floral dominant and lose some of that fizzy soda aspect (which it does indeed capture perfectly). I feel very split on this only because I think the daisy note isn't for me but I would honestly recommend this to anyone who wants a fizzy grapefruit citrus soda flowery vibe. Of note: My boyfriend, who has to be the pickiest person on earth (maybe I only say this because I subject him to bakery level gourmands which he is not a fan of) LOVES THIS. 3/5 **Alibi-** *""Passionfruit, orange blossom, guava, strawberry yuzu lemonade, and a dash of coconut cream over a rosewood base""* More tart! But this means full tropical and it is beautiful. It is sexy, fruity, tropical, tart, and unapologetic. This immediately transports me to Maui. The coconut keeps it balanced, you can get a dash of it throughout. Personally it leans too fruity and juicy for me. Like you really do smell like a mix of red fruits. I do get the name though, you smell so delicious it's almost too good to be true. This is a great fragrance for sure but it is just not for me personally. 3/5 **A Dog Named Pam-** *""Juniper berry, petitgrain, bitter orange, red mandarin, cedarwood, palo santo, and a warm fuzzy musk that feels to me like the hot belly of a clean dog""* This is what I think Nami from One Piece would smell like. This is a new HG for me. This is bitter orange without being too astringent or violent on the nose....","I had been so curious about them and haven't seen many reviews, so I figured I would post mine!

n2457jf,"‚Äâ Zara Supreme Vanilla, it opens with wood notes and then turns into a sweet vanilla. Bellavita Honey Oud, it's like a lighter version of Khamrah that can even be worn in the summer. It's less than $20 right now on Amazon. This would be my #1 choice if I could only have one spicy vanilla. Bath and Body Works Vanilla Romance smells great and the lotion will keep its scent all day. It layers gorgeously with any perfume that has a bit of spice. Rifaaqat and Lattafa Sehr are not to my liking. I bought both and they smell like gasoline. Rifaaqat turns into a cheap smelling musk after a few hours. Sehr has never made it that long before I had to wash it off. Lattafa Artisan Ethnique is spicy vanilla with a hint of rum. Nebras is an Ellish dupe. Paris Corner December Vanilla is a boozy vanilla patchouli bomb. I smelled it when I got it, and thought no way can I ever wear that, but it grew on me. It feels like being retro, tough and elegant all at the same time. Paris Corner Vanilla Mood is an interesting one. It doesn't smell like vanilla at first, more of a vaguely pleasant scent, then turns to a slightly leathery, sweet vanilla. Miim Miic 94 is a Kayali Vanilla 28 dupe. Miim Miic 108 and Khair Confection are Kayali vanilla candy rock sugar dupes. Both good, Confection is a bit better to me, plus the bottle is pretty.","Zara Supreme Vanilla, it opens with wood notes and then turns into a sweet vanilla.

Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth perfume and matching body spray cause I'm a likes to layer bitch. Walmart. Blind buy! Mugler Angel Eau de Toilette. Amazon Canada Prime deal. Very nice light scent. Also, blind buy! D&C Devotion. Saw one box at Winners, ran to Shoppers to test it, then prayed to the perfume gods and ran back to get it at Winners. Got it for a freakin' STEAL. Kayali Lovefest Burning Cherry. Blind buy (yeah, i know. I have a problem) but I'm soo glad I did! Love it. Hubby went nuts over it. Sephora. Scandal by JPG. I had tried a sampler of the Absolu and loved it but read the original had more honey notes. Went and tried it and loved it even more. Got 20 percent off at Shoppers today with the friends and family deal. Finally, Lattafa Yara Candy. Another blind buy (seriously, I need adult supervision) but I do like it.

July 15, 2025, 1:05am Macy's may be holding on to its longtime position as the top U.S. retailer by share of fragrance sales, but plenty of other shifts are afoot when it comes to who's winning the category. According to YipitData, Macy's accounted for 31.8 percent of fragrance sales during the month of May, indicating a 14.7-point lead from the category's next-biggest retailer during the period, Ulta Beauty. While significant, that lead is several points less than it was, say, two years prior in 2023, when Macy's accounted for more than 40 percent of fragrance sales during the same month. This shift is in part due to the nascent growth of alternative fragrance retailers as formidable competitors in the space. There's Amazon, which, per YipitData, accounted for 14.9 percent of fragrance sales in May across the platform's first- and third-party sellers (tracking after Sephora, which accounted for 15.5 percent during the same period). TikTok Shop, too, wasn't on the map at all in the U.S. until halfway through 2023, yet today the e-tailer ‚Äî which has propelled brands from Lattafa to Phlur to virality ‚Äî goes head-to-head with Target in terms of share of fragrance sales, actually outpacing Target slightly in May. Year-to-date, the top three fragrance brands at Sephora have been Kayali, Sol de Janeiro and YSL Beauty, in that order. For the month of May, Valentino overtook YSL for the number-three spot, while in April, Chanel's Chance Eau Splendide Eau de Parfum was the retailer's top-selling new stock keeping unit across the store. On Amazon, which YipitData reports has gained modest but steady share in fragrance since 2023, winning brands range from value-driven to designer, a dynamic which the platform's top two brands in May ‚Äî Lattafa and Versace ‚Äî quintessentially represent. Other top 10 brands on Amazon include Sol de Janeiro, Nautica and Dior (which, like all brands owned by LVMH Mo√´t Hennessy Louis Vuitton, does not officially sell on the platform). So far in 2025, fragrance has been the fastest-growing category in beauty, as has been the case since 2021. According to Circana, the category grew 4 percent in the prestige market and 8 percent in mass during the first quarter of this year.

1m2jnsk,"‚Äâ I recently bought Kayali YBM and wanted to find more gourmand scents on a budget. So, I went on a rampage buying the highest rated, budget friendly fragrances on Amazon. Unfortunately I do not like any of them except for Sweet Tooth by Sabrina Carpenter. It's a very light, clean scent, but doesn't last. The Bellavita Senorita is a stronger version of Versace Bright Crystal which I already own and don't particularly care for. If you like that scent, then that one is definitely worth buying. The rest of them smell like a substitute teacher from the 90's. Very powdery and overpowering. Also, none are reminiscent of any gourmand scent I've tried. A disappointing hall to say the least. Don't make the same mistake I did. If you have any Kayali dupes that are actually close matches then please let me know.","I recently bought Kayali YBM and wanted to find more gourmand scents on a budget.

In searching for something affordable, you spent a lot of money on bottles that you hated and cannot use, thereby wasting your funds. You could have just bought the Kayali (or whatever other gourmand) for the same price of all these bottles you didn't even like. It is always wiser to save up for one special, good quality bottle than to blind buy cheaper dupes that will not scratch the itch, as you've just learned. I only say this because you ended your post asking for recommendations of more dupes- you didn't learn from this mistake. Please, consider sampling first, so that you don't get stuck with full bottles you don't want.

As for recommendations, Theodoros Kalotinis and Akro make some very popular gourmands.
