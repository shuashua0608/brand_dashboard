mov_5703B752798FB1105AC62873B1117EC7,"  Ask any dermatologist: Sunscreen isn't just for beach days and backyard barbecues. Summer or winter, rain or shine, it's a must, they say. And yet, SPF is often too greasy to use every day, not to mention it can be shiny on skin, unruly under makeup, and stain clothes. What are the sunscreens doctors themselves use, we wondered, with clean-feeling formulations light enough for everyday wear? We reached out to skincare experts, specifically dermatologists and plastic surgeons for their recommendations, and their picks are simple to use, easy to find, and seriously effective. The best sunscreen is the one you'll actually wear, so here are nine doctor-recommended sunscreens you can blend easily into your daily routine. Best Dermatologist-Recommended Sunscreens Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50 Credit: Skinceuticals The most effective sunscreen for you is one you'll reach for time and again. For Dr. Don Yoo, a board-certified facial plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, Calif., it's the Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50. “For daily use, what I look for in a sunscreen is broad-spectrum protection in a non-comedogenic mineral base. Since I tend to have sensitive skin, I prefer sunscreens with a mineral base, but with a finish that feels clean on the skin with no white cast or heaviness.” He loves this Skinceuticals pick as it's “100 percent mineral” but blends in “smoothly without leaving a residue,” he said. La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-in Milk Sunscreen SPF 60 Credit: Amazon The sunscreen format you choose each day may vary with the activities your day holds. While his preference for daily-wear sunscreen is mineral, Dr. Yoo—an avid golfer—prefers a chemical sunscreen when he hits the links. “My current go-to is La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-in Milk Sunscreen SPF 60, as it provides long-lasting broad-spectrum coverage with 80 minutes of water resistance in a light, non-greasy finish that leaves no white cast and does not sting even when it gets into my eyes.” Eucerin Sun Sensitive Mineral Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 Credit: Amazon Though mineral sunscreens are the gold standard, the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide they contain can leave behind a chalky, white residue, especially on melanated skin. For mineral-based coverage that's also sheer, Dr. Ha Linh Vu, a board-certified dermatologist with Dermatology Partners in Philadelphia, Pa., swears by the affordable drugstore brand Eucerin. “My personal favorite daily SPF is the Eucerin Sun Sensitive Mineral Sunscreen,” Dr. Vu said. “I like that it is not too liquidy, so it does not run too much when you apply it. It also rubs in nicely without leaving a white cast, working well even on darker skin tones.” TiZO2 Non-Tinted Facial Mineral Sunscreen and Primer SPF 40 Credit: Amazon Another favorite of Dr. Vu's is TiZO2 Non-Tinted Facial Mineral Sunscreen and Primer. “I like this for all of the same reasons as the Eucerin sunscreen. In addition, it has a nice matte finish, so [it's] great for hotter days and for use as a primer,” she said. “The smaller size also makes it perfect for travel use. It comes in a tinted version that is great if you want protection from visible light, or to use it as a light foundation.” Isdin Eryfotona Actinica Zinc Oxide Broad Spectrum SPF 50+ Credit: Amazon Dr. Maya Thosani, a board-certified dermatologist with Modern Dermatology in Scottsdale, Ariz., is a noted fan of dual-action sunscreens, which not only protect from UVA and UVB rays, but also pamper skin with nourishing goodies to help reverse existing UV damage. For head-to-toe protection each day, she trusts Isdin's Eryfotona Actinica Zinc Oxide Broad Spectrum SPF 50+. “I absolutely love this for how lightweight it goes on being a purely mineral sunscreen,” Dr. Thosani said. “This is a double-action sunscreen, is cosmetically elegant, and appreciated by women in its tinted version—and they have an untinted one that men love.” Making it an even better value, Dr. Thosani points out, the bottle design allows for all the product to be used, down to the very last UV-filtering drop.

mov_517D015024D32B26DBC0B04A5F9D7692,"  Mumbai: Harindarpal Singh Banga, along with Indra Banga, will sell a 2.1% stake worth $140.3 million (approximately ₹1,200 crore) in beauty and personal care company Nykaa through a block deal, according to a term sheet accessed by Mint. The Bangas, among Nykaa's earliest investors, are offloading about 60 million shares at an offer price of ₹200 per share, a 5.5% discount to the latest closing price, the term sheet showed.

An exquisite tinted lip balm shockingly similar to Clinique's ""Black Honey"" but doesn't cost nearly as much. It comes in a weightless, non-sticky formula that glides onto your pout to give 'em a subtle polished tint of your choosing. Soon you'll be smackin' your lips all over the place, and no one can really blame you when they look this good. ♀ My colleague Emma Lord can vouch for this: ""I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference!"" Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a pink honey version, individually, and as a two-pack that includes both!) . 2. A three-pack of retro-inspired polarized sunglasses that'll diversify your accessory portfolio with some vintage flair without overspending a single pair of Ray-Bans. It never hurts to have ✨options✨ and you won't find a better bang for your buck. Promising review: ""I've been buying these for years. They replaced my Ray-Bans that look identical! Fit great and with the price point I don't have to worry too much with my kids and being on the go!"" —Jessica M Get a pack of three from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in 13 sets, as well as packs of two and individual pairs). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you, like me, are wondering when sunscreen became one of the most expensive skincare items ever? Enter this affordable find, which offers SPF 35 *and* goes on smooth and clear without any white cast. It works well as a blurring primer to create the perf setup before applying makeup too! TL:DR; it's the more affordable version of Supergoop! My colleague Jenae Sitzes uses it: ""The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop! 's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop! 's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop! 's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop! 's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop! 's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop! 's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!"" Promising review: ""This sunscreen is a gem. I was not expecting to love it as much as I do.

And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop! 's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop! 's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!"" Promising review: ""This sunscreen is a gem. I was not expecting to love it as much as I do. I absolutely love E.l.f. products, but I rarely try their skincare....",2025-07-02 23:31:02,en,WEB,,,♀✨⬇,c4524b5b45c6877c788bed1dcee918e9,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This appears to be a genuine user-generated content (UGC) review with several key non-promotional indicators:

Investment banks Goldman Sachs (India) Securities and JP Morgan India were reportedly appointed as placement agents for the deal. Shares of FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd, the parent company of beauty and fashion retailer Nykaa, slipped sharply on Thursday, weighed down by a large block deal involving one of its early investors. The stock fell nearly 5 percent in early trade, touching an intraday low of around Rs 201 on the NSE, amid heightened selling pressure on the bourses. As per media reports, Harindarpal Singh Banga along with Indra Banga, offloaded approximately six crore shares in the company through bulk transactions. The deal was executed at a floor price of Rs 200 per share, which is around around 5 percent below Wednesday's closing price of Rs 211.59—triggering a swift reaction from investors. The total value of the transaction is estimated to be in the range of Rs 1,200 crore, as per multiple media reports. Investment banks Goldman Sachs (India) Securities and JP Morgan India were reportedly appointed as placement agents for the deal. Harindarpal Singh Banga, the founder of the Hong Kong-based Caravel Group, held an 8.7 per cent stake in Nykaa prior to the company's stock market debut in 2021. The Nayar family, who established the brand, continues to hold a controlling stake of 52 per cent and has not divested any shares since the IPO. This recent sale follows a similar move nearly a year ago, when Banga sold four crore shares—equivalent to a 1.43 per cent stake—at a price of Rs 208.30 per share in August. That transaction reduced his ownership from 6.40% to 4.97%. Robust financial results Despite Thursday's share price drop, Nykaa has posted solid financial performance in recent quarters. The company reported a three-fold jump in net profit for the March quarter, which rose to Rs 20 crore. For the full financial year, net profit more than doubled to Rs 66 crore, underpinned by continued strength in its beauty and personal care verticals. Expansion plans on track Over the last one year, Nykaa has introduced an unprecedented number of international beauty labels to the Indian market through new partnerships with globally renowned names such as Yves Saint Laurent, NARS, Kerastase, Eucerin, GHD, Armani Beauty, Supergoop, and Nexxus, among others. As it enters its next phase of expansion, the company is focused on driving sustainable profitability. It is targeting a mid-20 percent compound annual growth rate in its beauty and personal care (BPC) segment over the next five years. In parallel, Nykaa is looking to strengthen its offline footprint by scaling up its presence in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. The retailer plans to grow its physical store network from the current 237 locations to over 500 by FY30.

mov_B58F2493E0835F8513A519F3C794AE3D,"  This blurring powder is basically pure witchcraft and your *best* weapon against heat and humidity. And no, it's not the $59 Givenchy version. 1. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder, which is SO GOOD at eliminating shine and blurring pores that I feel like it'd smirk at you and go, ""How 'bout that, huh? "" if it had a human form. If you dread summer because you love wearing makeup but the heat and humidity leave it looking patchy, this'll lock it in with a smooth, semi-matte finish. Your oily T-zone doesn't know what's coming for it. One reviewer compares this to a $59 Givenchy powder! Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""This is the secret for makeup in hot and humid climates! I am a sweaty person, but I also love wearing makeup regardless of the weather. While holidaying in Southeast Asia at the start of wet season, I faced temperatures between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius (95–104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity. After finishing my base makeup, I applied this powder all over. I did not use a setting spray because most break me out. Luckily, no setting spray was necessary while using this setting powder! It kept my foundation and cream blush from separating or becoming patchy, and also kept me from being too shiny. I reapplied a couple of times per day. This is magical and I will definitely be using regularly during the summers in North America too!"" —Sara Lima Get it from Amazon for $25. 2. A smocked midi dress because Hill House's Nap Dress is truly ~dreamy~ but your bank account is like, ""Um, we still need to buy groceries."" This cutie's a fraction of the cost and just as gorgeous, not to mention breathable as heck thanks to its 100% organic cotton poplin fabric. Prepare to fall head over heels for this dress — I definitely did. I recently wore this dress (in shade Lipstick Pink) to an outdoor wedding and I. AM. OBSESSED. It hugs my frame beautifully with the stretchy smocked waist — I can even get away with not wearing a bra, though for context I'm a B cup — and the flowy bottom of the dress sits just right. I personally haven't tried Hill House's Nap Dress (I drool over the designs, but $178 is a little too steep for me), but I'm perfectly happy to stock up on this dress in a few colors for around the same price. My colleague Heather Braga, on the other hand, is a Hill House devotee — but even she was impressed by this cheaper option: ""Listen, I am the proud owner of NINE Hill House Nap Dresses. I condone splurging on them (truly, by all means) and will be the first to tell you they are worth every penny. That being said, I tried out one of these from Quince and LOVE it. I have the Tribeca Stripe pattern and cannot believe how similar it feels to the other brand. It's my current go-to style for my frame (two kids in two years, send prayers) and is one of the few things I know I can throw on and KNOW I look great. Will definitely add another to an upcoming order and have been shouting from the rooftops how wonderful this brand fits."" Get it from Quince for $69.90 (available in sizes XS–XL and nine styles). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you're still trying to find a daily sunscreen you don't despise. This clear gel sunscreen offers SPF 35 and goes on so smooth and lightweight, you'll immediately forget you're wearing it — no white cast here, folks. It doubles as a blurring primer, so it's great for wearing under makeup too! If you love Supergoop but the price is becoming hard to swallow...may I suggest trying this, because it's *very* similar. The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!...","This blurring powder is basically pure witchcraft and your *best* weapon against heat and humidity.

Lately F1 drivers were spotted in fashion week front rows, and brands like Puma and Ferrari released apparel collections. The crossover into fashion is a real cultural shift.

In 2025, they collaborated with indie artists to seed “sounds of summer” content on TikTok and Instagram, tying their drink to a laid-back, beachy lifestyle vibe.

mov_3D37899CF39CC8962B176D885888A397,"  This year, Amazon Prime Day becomes Amazon Prime Days—you can score deals for four days (instead of two) to be exact, from now to July 11. It's the longest sale the mega-retailer has ever done, and the discounts are, as always, a doozy. For the last few weeks, I have been combing through thousands of beauty deals, and have come out the other side with the 59 best skin care, makeup, body care, and hair care must-haves you should shop before the sale ends. The lowest prices begin with a $4 body exfoliating brush that I consider necessary for smooth summer skin, and on the most expensive side, Shark's rarely-on-sale hair styler (which I've never seen this cheap before). You'll also find under-the-radar picks (Dearcloud's serum blush), top-rated products (L'Oreal's Lumi Glotion skin enhancer), celebrity-used favorites (Laura Geller's baked foundation), my go-tos (Medicube's exosome serum), and much more. Best Deals Overall It was hard enough to pare this list down to 59 products, and even more difficult to single out the nine best, but here they are. There are things like Laneige's lip mask and Cosrx's snail mucin serum that you should always stock up on during sales, plus celebrity favorites like NuFace's microcurrent device, Naturium's body butter, and Supergoop's tinted primer. Naturium Skin-Renewing Retinol Body Lotion Amazon Naturium's body care is next-level, which has made fans of Hailey Bieber, Demi Moore and me. I'm going to pass on my usual order to try out this retinol body lotion. Besides the titular ingredient, there's allatonin and shea butter; it's an anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, cell-renewing, radiance-enhancing, moisturizing (whew) combination. Best Anti-Aging Skin Care Deals I know that everyone has different skin care concerns, but to paint with a broad brush, it's safe to say a lot of people are concerned with reducing and/or preventing signs of aging. As such, I have meticulously picked the 10 best on-sale anti-aging products for everything wrinkle, fine lines, and firmness-related. On the cheapest end of the spectrum, there's a $12 Medicube serum, and the most expensive—yet still incredibly affordable—is a $35 Eight Saints Eye Cream.

CeraVe's Skin Renewing Anti-Aging Retinol Serum is a great choice because when it comes time for a restock, at $23, it's still a steal. The titular retinol is a wrinkle-reducing, dark spot-fading, and skin-firming powerhouse. It's complemented by a trio of plumping ceramides and ultra-hydrating hyaluronic acid. One shopper said that their “forehead had deep lines” that were visible even when they weren't  “creasing [their] brow.” After a month of using this they noted they “can't see them” anymore. Medicube Salmon DNA PDRN Pink Peptide Serum Amazon This feels like a line from Saturday Night Live, but it's true: salmon sperm skin care is everywhere. This Medicube serum uses bits of DNA derived from the stuff and for more than just shock value. It improves firmness, texture, and hydration, and fast. This formula also includes niacinamide and vitamin C-rich holy basil, a duo that has wrinkle-filling and skin-brightening properties. A shopper in their late 60s “loves the way this has made [their] face look” by making wrinkles look “less noticeable.” Best Hair Growth Deals If you want perpetually long, thick, and healthy hair, it means (unless you are genetically gifted) that you must always be searching for and buying hair growth products. To ease the financial strain this may cause, I recommend stocking up during mega-sales like Prime Day. You can go with an obvious choice like the fervently loved Mielle Organics' oil, try a celebrity go-to treatment, or upgrade your shampoo and conditioner routine. Virtue Healing Hair Oil Amazon There is a high probability that this is the most popular hair care product in Hollywood. Off the top of my head, I can tell you its celebrity fans include Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Garner, and Anne Hathaway. This oil helps promote hair growth through a variety of healing (hence its name) ingredients, the most important of which is the brand's proprietary Alpha Keratin 60ku; think of it as a honing system that targets the strands and areas that need it the most....","This year, Amazon Prime Day becomes Amazon Prime Days—you can score deals for four days (instead of two) to be exact, from now to July 11.

This oil helps promote hair growth through a variety of healing (hence its name) ingredients, the most important of which is the brand's proprietary Alpha Keratin 60ku; think of it as a honing system that targets the strands and areas that need it the most....",2025-07-08 04:30:00,en,WEB,,,,c35d2f0d3d0a8332ac5a34ab5c2a691c,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This appears to be a comprehensive product roundup article about Amazon Prime Day deals, with Supergoop! being one of many brands mentioned.

Nordstrom understands the beauty of a great deal. During the department store's much-awaited Anniversary Sale, hundreds of beauty sets are up for grabs — including exclusives from hardly-ever-on-sale luxury brands like La Mer, Augustinus Bader and Dr. Dennis Gross. Page Six's Picks While deals are already available for Nordstrom Icon cardholders, they open to the brand's Ambassador tier on July 9, followed by Influencers and the general public on July 10 and 12, respectively. Below, start shopping (or curating your wishlist) with our roundup of the best celebrity-approved beauty buys — but act fast, as the most popular products tend to sell out long before the sale ends on August 4. Nordstrom La Mer's products are famously pricey, but stars like Jennifer Lopez, Kate Hudson and Selena Gomez swear they're worth it. Right now, Nordstrom's offering a rare opportunity to bag the luxury line's signature Créme de La Mer for less, along with several other mini must-haves. Nordstrom Want to smell like a star? Sofia Richie and Meghan Markle have both cited this mineral, woody Jo Malone London blend as a signature scent. Nordstrom This bestselling formula does triple duty as makeup remover, cleanser and moisturizer. Equally multitasking stars like Bethenny Frankel rave about the stuff, now available in a jumbo value version exclusively at Nordstrom. “I am partial to the original one because it makes me feel like I'm in a botanical spa,” Frankel said on TikTok, naming it one of the “expensive” items she deems “worth it.” Nordstrom Emily Ratajkowski called these pre-packaged peels “the best for exfoliating your skin” in a recent W interview, admitting she'd skipped the skincare step before. “I've noticed a huge improvement in the texture and tonal quality of my skin,” she raved. Nordstrom If splurging doesn't scare you, there's also an unheard-of deal on a set featuring the brand's SpectraLite FaceWare Pro mask. (It's like getting peel pads, blurring cream and a lip treatment for free.) “I would die for it,” DeSorbo raved of the red- and blue light-powered mask in an Amazon Live. “I truly think it is one of the only LED masks I've ever used that actually works.” Pro tip: Sets like this have been among the first to sell out in previous years, so we'd recommend snapping this one up fast. Nordstrom From famous faces to Page Six staffers, plenty of beauty experts swear by NuFace. Tay Lautner told us the “super user-friendly” device is one of her “favorite things to use to help lift, plump and smooth [her] skin before an event,” while Kate Hudson raved about the brand to Mindbodygreen. “When I do the NuFace every day, I feel a huge difference in my skin,” she told the outlet. I was not expecting that because I always think those things feel gimmicky, but they really work.” Our very own managing editor, Alexandra D'Aluisio, is also a fan: “Nicola Coughlan used the NuFace Trinity+ in a Vogue “Beauty Secrets” video … she even insisted she knew when she 'went ham' on the product because her 'cheekbones were cheekboning' in certain scenes,” she says. “That was enough to convince me to buy, and I've been trying to use it at least three times a week ever since.” Nordstrom Sabrina Carpenter can do a lot with 15 minutes — but applying her signature blush will only take you a matter of seconds. The star's long worked with makeup artist Carolina Gonzalez, who told us she applies the blendable formula on the mid-apples of the pop phenom's cheeks. “When you start on the cheekbone and go up from there, it gives you more of a lifted and snatched look,” Gonzalez explained. Nordstrom Love the Longchamp Le Pliage totes stars and royals like Kate Middleton have carried? In addition to a full-size version, the sale also includes this adorable mini makeup bag. Nordstrom Plenty of superstars stock up on Supergoop! , from Brooke Shields and Jessica Chastain to Christie Brinkley. (The latter recently told us she swears by the brand's “easy formulas.”) Nordstrom The 411 on stars' favorite face masks? So many stars use 111Skin, it just might be easier to name A-listers who haven't raved about the brand. Sydney Sweeney, Lady Gaga, Bella Hadid, Jenna Lyons and Priyanka Chopra (to name but a few) have all been linked to the label's luxe skincare. Page Six Style & Shopping Editor Elana Fishman is also impressed with the products, saying of the rose gold mask included in this set, “I slapped on this mask the morning of a video shoot, hoping it'd help me look my best on camera — and boy, did it live up to the hype.” Nordstrom...","Page Six may be compensated and/or receive an affiliate commission if you click or buy through our links.

mov_5A4DEBA3C3502A1809F4B7D2F8F2EDF7,"  It's not every day that I'm willingly spend money on beauty products. That is, until Amazon Prime Day rolls around. As a beauty editor, my desk is consistently stacked high with boxes of products vying for a chance to be tried and praised, but few things beat the tubes and jars I've trusted for years. Because I'm a bit spoiled by free products, I find it hard to splash out on my favorites when I'm running low—but when they're slashed by as much as 50% during Prime Day, which runs from July 8 to 11, I'll never hesitate to hit purchase. To access these steep discounts while they last, you'll need to sign up for an Amazon Prime membership, which is free for 30 days before charging a monthly fee. From there, you can reap the benefits of on-sale luxury and drugstore beauty, along with the fashion must-haves, home décor findings, and more that Who What Wear editors have meticulously selected. Below, the Amazon beauty products that I buy on repeat (starting at just $4!) from brands such as Kiehl's, Laneige, Supergoop! , and more—plus a few big-ticket items I'd recommend snagging now that they're on sale. Editor-Approved Beauty Deals Under $30 Dr.Althea 345 Relief Cream Daily Face Moisturizer Of all the facial moisturizers I own, I never travel anywhere without the Dr.Althea 345 Relief Cream. I love this soothing cream for its niacinamide-forward formula, which helps quell my rosacea-induced redness, while hyaluronic acid and ceramides help hydrate the skin and lock in moisture. Plus, its squeeze-tube bottle makes it easily portable, which is why I never hesitate to hit buy when I spot it on sale. Wonderskin Wonder Blading Lip Stain Peel Off Masque I, along with the rest of the Who What Wear beauty team, fell in love with this best-selling viral lip stain from Amazon this year: the Wonderskin Wonder Blading Lip Stain that sent TikTok into a tizzy. All you do is let the dark formula sit for 10 to 30 seconds like a mask (I like to apply it like lip liner) before wiping it off with a damp towel for a tint that lasts for hours. Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Speaking of peeling things off, there's never been a better time to stock up on Hero's original pimple patches than while they're on sale for just $10. These hydrocolloid stickers work overnight to zap zits and whiteheads after just one use—no picking or popping necessary. I keep these patches in my medicine cabinet and pack a sheet in every carry-on for the inevitable travel-induced breakouts. Nécessaire The Body Wash Crowned one of our very favorite bodywashes this year, the Nécessaire The Body Wash is a necessity (get it?) for several reasons. It's made with a vitamin-rich formula that supports hydration, even skin tones, and smoother texture, and its gentle scent doesn't bother any of our beauty editors—even those of us with sensitive skin. Now, you can nab any scent for just $21. Briogeo Style + Treat Yuzu + Plum Oil Sleek Stick I, along with everyone else who favors a bad-hair-day updo, have a lot of love for the sleek, slicked-back bun. However, there were always stray hairs and breakage poking up at my hairline—that is until the Briogeo Sleek Stick came into my life. While other wax sticks at Amazon would take multiple washes to actually get out of my hair, this non-greasy, never-damaging wax offers a smooth, glossy finish that makes my strands feel soft and washes like a breeze, no scrubbing required. Oh, and did I mention it's a Who What Wear Beauty Award winner? Supergoop! Glowscreen SPF 40 I likely need not introduce you to the Supergoop! Glowscreen, but I do need to inform you that it's on sale and ripe for the taking. This radiant, tone-evening sunscreen offers a lit-from-within glow while smoothing your skin into a filter-like veil; its formula is pumped full of SPF 40 and hyaluronic acid for an extra dose of protection. It's not only a favorite tinted sunscreen, but it's a top-notch makeup primer, too. Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara The Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara from Essence was already a steal at just $5 full-price, but at its Prime Day rate, buying a tube almost feels illegal. My fellow beauty editors have waxed poetic about this inexpensive formula for its impressive lengthening and curl-preserving powers, and I've personally bought this tube twice in the past year. No really, you need it. Shop More Editor Recommendations L'Oréal Paris True Match Lumi Glotion...","It's not every day that I'm willingly spend money on beauty products.

mov_7258CD92C43C5E8A3FB94017BC1A412D,"  In my years as a shopping editor, the times I buy a new beauty product at full price are few and far between. Whether I need to restock my combination skincare routine or am looking to test a buzzy new beauty device, a great deal is always around the corner. Looks like it's true that good things come to those who wait—Amazon Prime Day is here just in time to refresh my summer beauty routine. From now through July 11, you can spot hundreds (if not thousands) of deals on Amazon in every major category, including summer shoes and vacation essentials. However, it's the sale of the year for beauty fans as top brands like Supergoop, Sol de Janeiro, Shark Beauty, Laneige, and so many more are at a major discount. To put it simply, Amazon Prime Day is not a sale you want to skip. To ensure you don't miss out on any of the incredible discounts, I'm bringing you the ultimate edit of Amazon Prime Day's best beauty deals. Ahead, uncover some of our editors' holy grail nail finds, skincare, fragrance, devices, makeup, and hair care currently on sale. Be sure to keep this page bookmarked, as the beauty deals will continue to arrive as I discover them in real-time. The Best Overall Beauty Deals at Amazon Prime Day Amazon Prime Day at a Glance Best Skincare Deals at Amazon Prime Day Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Spf 50 (Was $38) While technically this is a facial sunscreen, it doubles as a makeup primer that can be used anytime, anywhere. Katherine J. Igoe, an MC contributing editor, says, ""It goes on smoothly and feels incredibly lightweight without any of the annoyances of most sunscreens."" Katherine J. Igoe tests Supergoop! Unseen Sunscren SPF 50. (Image credit: MC Editors) Bioderma Bioderma Sensibio H2o Micellar Water (Was $14) Waterproof mascara, SPF, makeup, and dirt don't stand a chance with this French pharmacy favorite in your routine. A couple of drops on a cotton pad will remove your makeup, all while balancing pH, hydrating, and soothing skin. CeraVe Cerave Hydrating Cream to Foam Cleanser (Was $20) This cleanser is just what your skincare routine needs as a first step—it gently removes makeup and grime without drying out your skin. The cream lathers quickly into a foam, so a little bit goes a long way. Embryolisse Embryolisse Lait-Crème Concentré (Was $29) Another French beauty staple, this moisturizer will have your skin feeling baby soft and smooth in no time. It's a rich cream that deeply nourishes the skin, without feeling too heavy or leaving behind any greasiness. Kiehl's Avocado Eye Treatment (Was $38) This is one of the best eye creams for dryness, so it's not a bad idea to stock up before the fall. It uses avocado oil and caffeine to help smooth puffy eyes and fine lines and to boost radiance. Best Beauty Device Deals at Amazon Prime Day Shark Shark Hd430 Flexstyle Air Styling & Drying System (Was $350) As someone with minimal hair styling skills, the Shark FlexStyle is the only way I know how to do my hair.

Whether I need to restock my combination skincare routine or am looking to test a buzzy new beauty device, a great deal is always around the corner. Looks like it's true that good things come to those who wait—Amazon Prime Day is here just in time to refresh my summer beauty routine. From now through July 11, you can spot hundreds (if not thousands) of deals on Amazon in every major category, including summer shoes and vacation essentials. However, it's the sale of the year for beauty fans as top brands like Supergoop, Sol de Janeiro, Shark Beauty, Laneige, and so many more are at a major discount. To put it simply, Amazon Prime Day is not a sale you want to skip. To ensure you don't miss out on any of the incredible discounts, I'm bringing you the ultimate edit of Amazon Prime Day's best beauty deals. Ahead, uncover some of our editors' holy grail nail finds, skincare, fragrance, devices, makeup, and hair care currently on sale. Be sure to keep this page bookmarked, as the beauty deals will continue to arrive as I discover them in real-time. The Best Overall Beauty Deals at Amazon Prime Day Amazon Prime Day at a Glance Best Skincare Deals at Amazon Prime Day Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Spf 50 (Was $38) While technically this is a facial sunscreen, it doubles as a makeup primer that can be used anytime, anywhere. Katherine J. Igoe, an MC contributing editor, says, ""It goes on smoothly and feels incredibly lightweight without any of the annoyances of most sunscreens."" Katherine J. Igoe tests Supergoop! Unseen Sunscren SPF 50. (Image credit: MC Editors) Bioderma Bioderma Sensibio H2o Micellar Water (Was $14) Waterproof mascara, SPF, makeup, and dirt don't stand a chance with this French pharmacy favorite in your routine. A couple of drops on a cotton pad will remove your makeup, all while balancing pH, hydrating, and soothing skin. CeraVe Cerave Hydrating Cream to Foam Cleanser (Was $20) This cleanser is just what your skincare routine needs as a first step—it gently removes makeup and grime without drying out your skin. The cream lathers quickly into a foam, so a little bit goes a long way. Embryolisse Embryolisse Lait-Crème Concentré (Was $29) Another French beauty staple, this moisturizer will have your skin feeling baby soft and smooth in no time. It's a rich cream that deeply nourishes the skin, without feeling too heavy or leaving behind any greasiness. Kiehl's Avocado Eye Treatment (Was $38) This is one of the best eye creams for dryness, so it's not a bad idea to stock up before the fall. It uses avocado oil and caffeine to help smooth puffy eyes and fine lines and to boost radiance. Best Beauty Device Deals at Amazon Prime Day Shark Shark Hd430 Flexstyle Air Styling & Drying System (Was $350) As someone with minimal hair styling skills, the Shark FlexStyle is the only way I know how to do my hair.

mov_FF01CBB2B88BCD4A1ED6B768510483A4,"  Current Issue — Most Popular — Good sun habits. Sunscreen is a product people are constantly reminded to wear every single day. And for good reason: protecting your skin from the sun's ultraviolet rays—UVA, which causes premature aging, and UVB, which leads to sunburn and can contribute to skin cancer. But that doesn't mean it has to feel like a chore—especially when the right formula doubles as a makeup primer or hydrating lotion. Here are the best sunscreens to slot into your routine and keep you sun-safe (and glowing) all summer long. No matter which one you choose, don't forget to apply it properly: use a nickel-sized dollop or follow the two-finger rule to ensure your face and neck get the coverage they need. Apply 15 minutes before heading outside, and reapply every two hours—especially if you're swimming or sweating. Cle de Peau Beauté UV Protective Cream SPF 50+ This chemical sunscreen offers up to 10 hours of hydration. It features standout ingredients like Moroccan thyme extract, which helps combat signs of photoaging, along with plant extracts such as mangosteen and ginseng, as well as a complex with Japanese pearl shell extract to help leave the skin looking refreshed. Shiseido Ultra Sun Protector Lotion SPF 50+ This non-comedogenic formula offers coverage against both types of ultraviolet rays and is powered by innovative technology that actually strengthens protection when exposed to heat and water. Infused with plant extracts and amino acids that help defend against blue light and signs of aging, it's an ideal choice for those who are active in the sun. Naked Sundays SPF50+ Collagen Glow 100% Mineral Perfecting Priming Lotion This non-comedogenic mineral sunscreen features ingredients effective for sun protection without oxybenzone, linked to coral reef damage. Gentle enough for sensitive skin, it's also infused with watermelon extract and leaves a translucent finish (no white cast in sight). EltaMD UV Clear Tinted Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 EltaMD's tinted sunscreen offers protection against both UVA and UVB rays with a hybrid, non-comedogenic formula that combines both chemical and physical filters. The subtle tint provides a natural-looking glow with no white cast. Infused with niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin E, it also has a lightweight texture that layers well under makeup and helps even out skin tone. La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral Tinted Ultra Fluid SPF 50 Facial Sunscreen Another standout physical sunscreen, this formula uses mineral-based titanium dioxide to deliver broad-spectrum protection. It's a good option for sensitive skin as it is non-comedogenic, gentle, and tinted for a natural glow. Infused with thermal spring water for antioxidant benefits, it absorbs quickly, making it an ideal base under makeup. Supergoop! Protec(tint) Daily SPF Tint SPF 50 Sunscreen Skin Tint Supergoop's Protec(tint) SPF offers both chemical and physical sun protection—plus clay infused with hyaluronic acid and additional defence against stress on skin from radiation, blue light, and pollution. Available in 14 shades, it's a sunscreen that doubles as complexion coverage. Paula's Choice Resist Youth-Extending Daily Hydrating Fluid SPF 50 This sunscreen offers chemical protection against UVA and UVB rays, and features ingredients such as oat bran, green tea, and grape seed extract for a soothing effect. It's a water-based formula aiming to calm and even the skin tone, leaving a smooth finish—ideal for someone who wears sunscreen on its own or layered under makeup.

It's an easy way to help maintain your dental hygiene, especially those harder to reach spaces in your mouth. Waterpik is like the Kleenex of the water flosser world and the Aquarius is our favorite model overall. It's powerful, versatile and carries an ADA seal of approval—which is not universal to all water flossers. This Prime Day deal is the best price we've seen for this model in 2025. Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 Smokeless Fire Pit With Stand Fire pits are a year-round staple, whether you're camping, posted up at the beach or hanging out in your backyard. Solo Stove's portable smokeless design is our favorite fire pit overall for its efficiency and versatility. Just be warned: I let my dad borrow mine for a road trip and he never gave it back. A 20% discount on the solo stove is not atypical, but it's still a nice opportunity to grab one on sale if you're in the market. Field Company No.8 Cast-Iron Skillet This upgraded cast-iron is ideal for home cooks ready to invest in an heirloom-quality piece. The Field's skillet is lightweight—roughly a pound lighter than other designs we tested—and has a smooth cooking surface that helps create a nonstick barrier for delicate foods like eggs. Better yet: This discount is the best price we've seen for this skillet on Amazon. Supergoop PLAY Everyday Lotion SPF 50 Our favorite sunscreen hydrates, calms and protects your skin from the sun without leaving you feeling greasy. Its formula helps block UVA, UVB and infrared radiation, and it can hold up against sweat and water for over an hour. You can also use the lotion head-to-toe for quick, full-body coverage. Supergoop hosts semi-regular sales online, but this is still a great time to stock up for summer. Away The Bigger Carry-On Luggage You've likely heard of Away by now. The trendy suitcase brand is a favorite among our editors and the maker of our pick for the best carry-on luggage overall. The Bigger Carry-On is spacious, durable and thoughtfully designed with an internal compression system that makes it easier to fit everything you need in your bag. This 20% discount is limited to select colorways, including the pictured Cloud Gray above. Other colors are available for 15% off. St.Tropez Self Tan Express Mousse We love a sun-kissed tan; a good self-tanner can help give you that beachy look without the potential sun damage. Our favorite formula is an easy-to-apply mousse that absorbs quickly....","Every year we highlight top picks from our extensive product testing for the Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards (FVBPA).

It's an easy way to help maintain your dental hygiene, especially those harder to reach spaces in your mouth. Waterpik is like the Kleenex of the water flosser world and the Aquarius is our favorite model overall. It's powerful, versatile and carries an ADA seal of approval—which is not universal to all water flossers. This Prime Day deal is the best price we've seen for this model in 2025. Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 Smokeless Fire Pit With Stand Fire pits are a year-round staple, whether you're camping, posted up at the beach or hanging out in your backyard. Solo Stove's portable smokeless design is our favorite fire pit overall for its efficiency and versatility. Just be warned: I let my dad borrow mine for a road trip and he never gave it back. A 20% discount on the solo stove is not atypical, but it's still a nice opportunity to grab one on sale if you're in the market. Field Company No.8 Cast-Iron Skillet This upgraded cast-iron is ideal for home cooks ready to invest in an heirloom-quality piece. The Field's skillet is lightweight—roughly a pound lighter than other designs we tested—and has a smooth cooking surface that helps create a nonstick barrier for delicate foods like eggs. Better yet: This discount is the best price we've seen for this skillet on Amazon. Supergoop PLAY Everyday Lotion SPF 50 Our favorite sunscreen hydrates, calms and protects your skin from the sun without leaving you feeling greasy. Its formula helps block UVA, UVB and infrared radiation, and it can hold up against sweat and water for over an hour. You can also use the lotion head-to-toe for quick, full-body coverage. Supergoop hosts semi-regular sales online, but this is still a great time to stock up for summer. Away The Bigger Carry-On Luggage You've likely heard of Away by now. The trendy suitcase brand is a favorite among our editors and the maker of our pick for the best carry-on luggage overall. The Bigger Carry-On is spacious, durable and thoughtfully designed with an internal compression system that makes it easier to fit everything you need in your bag. This 20% discount is limited to select colorways, including the pictured Cloud Gray above. Other colors are available for 15% off. St.Tropez Self Tan Express Mousse We love a sun-kissed tan; a good self-tanner can help give you that beachy look without the potential sun damage. Our favorite formula is an easy-to-apply mousse that absorbs quickly....",2025-07-08 19:50:54,en,WEB,,,,7d9b6871d898561034a35a3c6a2cf78f,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This appears to be a legitimate product review/roundup from Forbes Vetted, a reputable product review platform.

mov_8FA0902E303B553C6016F99206C985DE,"  When it comes to skincare, I favour low-maintenance, hybrid formulas that can shave minutes off my routine. Eliminating the need for multiple steps, tinted SPFs protect my skin from sun damage and give me glowy, pigmented coverage. Tick, tick, tick. But with some of the best formulas on the market costing upwards of £30 for a small tube (we're looking at you, Ultra Violette and Supergoop!) , I'm always looking for budget buys that can do the job just as well. Enter: Garnier's vitamin C daily UV brightening fluid glow (a mouthful, I know). My go-to affordable tinted SPF, the lightweight formula has a creamy consistency that's easy to blend across your face, while SPF50 has all bases covered when it comes to sun protection. Designed to be one-shade-fits-all, the cream gives your skin a glowy and lightweight coverage. The slimline tube is perfect for packing in your beach bag on holiday and topping up when you want a little more coverage after a dip in the sea. The best part is that it costs a little more than £10 – but it's now even cheaper thanks to Amazon Prime Day. Whether you're jetting off on holiday, enjoying the first sunny days of spring or looking for a new everyday skincare staple, here's why Garnier's tinted SPF should be in your next beauty haul. How we tested Testing the vitamin C-infused formula alongside more premium products, I've worn it for beach days and office days. Considering the ease of application (whether with a brush, sponge or fingers), coverage claims, staying power, the look and feel on my skin, as well as its SPF credentials, here's my verdict on Garnier's tinted SPF. The verdict: Garnier vitamin C daily UV brightening fluid glow Easily rivalling more premium tinted SPF formulas, Garnier's vitamin C face cream not only provides SPF50 protection but also gives skin a glowy, lightweight coverage. The finish is long-lasting and dewy, while the value for money is stellar at £5. Looking for more tinted SPF recommendations?

This 40-ounce mother of mugs carries as much fluid as a 7-Eleven Super Big Gulp while stylishly keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold, and it still fits in most car cup holders. Be warned: Stanley deals are going out of stock fast, and only some colors—think Almond Rose and Fuschia—are available for under $30 right now. Move fast. More deals on insulated drinkware and containers LEGO Classic Large Creative Brick Box 10698 Building Toy Set — $25.59 (was $59.99) People love a creative Lego set that becomes, say, the Millennium Falcon, Old Trafford, or a cute flower bouquet.

Dermatologists recommend using a full ounce on any exposed skin and reapplying every two hours, after swimming, or if you're super sweaty. Yeah, you probably need another tube.

Scouted selects products independently. If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission. Amazon Prime Day (week) is in full swing, and day three of the 96-hour event is officially live. This means shoppers will be able to score major savings on thousands of coveted items (as long as you have an Amazon Prime membership, that is). But Amazon isn't the only retailer offering Black Friday-level deals this week. In fact, since announcing the dates for Prime Day, many other businesses have dropped their sales that are set to take place during the same period. This means that even for those without a Prime membership or those who may not want to shop on Amazon, there is still a world of savings to be had during the event. Several brands are even offering sales that are actually better than Amazon's deals. We know that scouring the web to find these Prime Day-adjacent deals probably isn't worth your time, so we went ahead and did the work for you. Check out our list below of the best Prime Day sales that aren't on Amazon. Wayfair's massive Way Day sale may be well over, but the e-tailer's huge four-day flash sale is chock full of home decor and furniture deals that are on par with Black Friday.Refresh your activewear lineup without spending a fortune during Lululemon's Summer Scores event.

Best Buy's 'Black Friday in July' sale is full of major deals on par with Amazon's Prime Day discounts. You'll find brands like Samsung, Dyson, Apple, Breville, and HP marked down up to 40 percent off. The sale runs through Sunday. It's no secret that Allbirds is our favorite sneaker brand here at Scouted. Not only does the brand make stylish activewear shoes, but they're also eco-friendly and sustainable, which makes us feel even better about buying from the brand. What makes us feel even better about shopping at Allbirds is when we can score its pieces on sale.

We waded through the mountains of bargains for you and found some of the best deals in every category. FYI — deals move *fast*. We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. Hypoallergenic Blueland laundry detergent tablets for 30% off — this powerful plastic-free tablet can be dropped directly into the drum of your washing machine for stain-lifting magic. Oh, and once you realize how much easier (and better for our planet) this is than liquid detergent/pods, you'll never want to go back, so prepare wisely now. Promising review: ""I absolutely love these laundry tablets. I have always felt guilty about throwing such a large plastic jug away, and now I don't have to! I love how compact these tablets are; it makes them perfect even for traveling, and they leave my clothes smelling great. They work well with both hot and cold water, so I have no complaints!"" —Eme N. Price: $20.99 (originally $29.99) 2. Supergoop best-sellers for 20% off, including the wildly popular Glowscreen SPF 40 for anyone who wants a super glowy, lit-from-within complexion at all times. Better yet, it doubles as a makeup-gripping primer, so your glow will shine through your foundation while keeping you protected. Promising review: ""I've tried a lot of sunscreen and primers over the last year. I mean A LOT. My skin is super sensitive, acne-prone, and prone to dryness and redness. (Complicated, I know) This stuff doesn't feel heavy and moisturizes really well while not feeling like I'll break out later. It protected my skin from sunburn during six hours at Six Flags. I don't wear a ton of makeup, but the foundation and bronzer I wore didn't budge or crease. It makes your skin glow like [wild], which alone is a bit much for me, but under some foundation, it looks amazing! Def worth the buy and will buy again."" —H.E. Price: $17.60+ (originally $22+; available in three sizes and four shades; see more Supergoop deals here) 3. An Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for 50% off — if you've been putting off upgrading your old one or getting another one for your guest room, then now is the time to do it! Use this to stream over a million movies and shows, plus it even has an AI-powered TV search to help you find exactly what you need without struggling to type it in. Promising review: ""The Alexa Fire Stick might be the greatest invention since drive-thru coffee. I plugged it in, blinked twice, and boom — it was up and running. I didn't need a tech degree or a YouTube tutorial narrated by someone whispering in a British accent. Setup? Ridiculously simple. Navigation? Smooth like jazz. Lag? Nonexistent.

n2igwby,"  I'm not saying this to be argumentative, but I can't find a way to word it otherwise. I'd like you to try and explain why a non-Australian sunscreen wouldn't be ok to use for extended periods in the sun here if they have the same ratings. I think you misunderstand what ""Australian standards"" actually are. Though obviously not the entirety of it, they largely boil down to picking what filters are known factors and okay to use. Korea is faster to approve new filters due to how their own regulations work; which means they end up with more cosmetically elegant products and avoid the use of the typical ingredients that give the ""greasy"" feel sunscreen is known for. Australia is fast compared to the US, but is still a bit ""behind the times"" in this regard. But conversely, it's not like the filters Korea is using are new and not yet tested/proven. Again, I want to emphasise - plenty of these products have widely available, peer-reviewed and cross-tested results. Because they're mostly white-label, it shouldn't scare you that they're using newer filters than those in Australian formulas at the moment. They're proven formulas. Australia is just slower to approve them, and that may not even be due to Australia doing more rigorous testing. They're just classified differently here, so the approval process takes longer. The story Lab Muffin/Michelle brings up about the SuperGOOP sunscreen wasn't mentioned to downplay that sunscreen's efficacy (I know nothing about it). If that was her intent, she wouldn't have spent the rest of the video recommending imported sunscreens. Her language is English-speaking; by this logic, she would have no reason to bring up Asian market sunscreens. Look at what she says prior to that; Australian restrictions are preventing the discussion of Australian sunscreen products online, but she believes more discussion should be encouraged because it lessens the reputation of sunscreen as cosmetically inelegant and just overall ""undesirable."" When influencers talk more about the sunscreens that have worked for them and feel good to use, it turns sunscreen into a product people actually WANT to use - which is the main issue affecting how many people adequately protect themselves from the sun. I want to emphasise too that nowhere in her video does she say Australian sunscreens will be more effective than others in the Australian sun. There is another video she talks about this more, it may be one of her more recent ""Correcting Misinformation"" videos. Forgive me, I'm at work so I can't get the link. Could have been a short debunking another woman on YouTube who was spreading misinformation? Unsure. One example: Biore UV (one of the first Asian sunscreens to get huge overseas) has four filters that are approved in Australia, and all it's formulations have been tested incredibly rigorously under ISO methods that Australia accepts. However, the company hasn't brought it over here because they'd have to get it listed on the ARTG, get their factories certified in GMP (not particularly related to sunscreen testing; just general manufacturing practice), manufacture with new labeling that meets our regulations, among a multitude of other costs to keep their product on Australian shelves. Plus, being a water-resistant sunscreen (and arguably one of the best), there are even more things they'd need to pay for certification on. It's just not worth it for many overseas companies. That does not mean that the overseas testing it has had done on it is less valid than Australian testing. It meets Australian standards in terms of testing procedure and formulation, but that doesn't suddenly mean the company has the go ahead to sell it here. (3/4, Reddit wouldn't let me post the whole thing in one)","I'm not saying this to be argumentative, but I can't find a way to word it otherwise.

Plus, being a water-resistant sunscreen (and arguably one of the best), there are even more things they'd need to pay for certification on. It's just not worth it for many overseas companies. That does not mean that the overseas testing it has had done on it is less valid than Australian testing. It meets Australian standards in terms of testing procedure and formulation, but that doesn't suddenly mean the company has the go ahead to sell it here.

mov_E9341563588A2F77AF5CA430D6A324C5,"  Depending on how similar the items are, and the rights a company holds, dupes may or may not cross legal lines To customers, a lookalike to Ugg's Tasman slippers or a knock-off of Lululemon's ultra-popular Define jacket can be a fantastic bargain. But to the companies that make the original products, similar-but-cheaper items can be bad for business. While knock-offs are nothing new, dupes — short for ""duplicate"" — have exploded in popularity in recent years. And for many younger buyers, buying an imitation is no longer something to hide. ""A lot of the consumers that we're seeing on social media, on TikTok, are so proudly displaying the dupes that they found, kind of as a badge of honour. That stigma really isn't there anymore,"" said Julie Zerbo, editor-in-chief of fashion publication The Fashion Law. The rise of dupes has also brought a corresponding wave of lawsuits from companies, saying copies of their products shouldn't be allowed to exist. American Eagle, Sol de Janeiro, Benefit Cosmetics, Deckers Brands (Ugg's parent company) and Supergoop are just a few of the fashion and beauty companies on that list. Vancouver-based Lululemon became a recent entrant when it sued Costco late last month over three products it said were knock-offs of its clothing. But are they actually illegal? Intellectual property experts say it really depends on the rights a company has over a product, and whether customers can tell the difference between the original and its copycat. When do dupes cross the line? The term ""dupe"" itself has been appearing more in legal filings, says Alexandra Roberts, law and media professor at Northeastern University — including in Lululemon's against Costco. That could partially be because their appeal has grown among online shoppers. ""Where in previous years, a company might have just said, 'Oh, this looks to us like trademark infringement,' here, [brands] are kind of building a case around the idea of [a] dupe,"" Roberts said. ""The fact that something is perceived as a dupe ... that all works its way into the allegations."" WATCH | Trying to beat online fashion copies: Trying to beat online fashion copies 8 months agoDuration 2:25 Loren Mallett, an intellectual property lawyer in Vancouver, says any case where a company says it's been copied largely depends on the rights it has over its product. Patents, industrial designs and trademarks can all protect certain parts of an item — but a company has to formally register elements like its logo or packaging design. If it hasn't, it's probably out of luck, Mallett says. And even if it has, it still might be OK to sell something really similar. The legality of a dupe depends on whether customers could be confused by the two items and think they are the exact same, Roberts says. In Lululemon's case, for example, the question might be whether buyers of the Costco sweatshirt thought they were purchasing Lululemon's Scuba hoodie, Roberts says. She says people tend to like dupes specifically because they aren't the real deal, but a cheaper alternative. And for that reason, she says, many may not be successfully litigated against. LISTEN | Dupe culture: Why Gen Z is embracing fakes: While we don't necessarily think of them as dupes, generic brands — think Life brand products sold at Shoppers Drug Mart, or Walmart's Great Value — have occupied this space for a long time, Roberts says. And historically, courts have allowed them because customers understand that one is meant to be a cheaper alternative to the other. Mallett adds that the conversation around dupes could impact companies like Lululemon in court, as many customers have said online that some of Costco's products look just like Lululemon's. The athleisure company will likely argue this as evidence that Costco wanted to pass off its product as a Lululemon item — whereas Costco will likely say it is proof the customer knew for a fact they were buying a similar-looking alternative at a lower price, according to Mallett. A case study Zerbo says many dupe-related cases are still making their way through courts. But there are some resolved ones where the lookalike has come out on top. She points to a recent conflict in the U.S. between Steve Madden and Ganni as a good example. Danish footwear brand Ganni sent cease-and-desist letters to some companies that sold certain Steve Madden shoes, saying they looked too similar to its own buckle ballerina flats and two-strap sandals. But Steve Madden turned around and sued Ganni, saying it had no right to tell those retailers they couldn't sell the similar Steve Madden shoes, because there was ""nothing new or original"" about a shoe made of leather and that has straps, eyelets and buckles — common elements in lots of footwear. Ganni ultimately walked back its original legal threats, Zerbo said, and even agreed not to sue in the future over the shoe designs. (Ganni was more successful in its home country of Denmark, however.) Zerbo says these cases show how courts generally don't want monopolies, and try to prevent giving a brand that kind of power. ""That would be bad for competition, that would be bad for consumers, prices would go through the roof."" What does that mean for my dupes? Zerbo says duping is unlikely to slow down anytime soon, as many shoppers love a good deal. She says history is full of copycat designs, which have largely been allowed to exist. Take fast fashion, for example. Companies like H&M and Forever 21 became giants mainly by replicating runway elements for a cheaper price. ""It's such a big market. There's so much consumer demand for dupes that companies would be hard pressed to stop trying to make them.""...","Depending on how similar the items are, and the rights a company holds, dupes may or may not cross legal lines To customers, a lookalike to Ugg's Tasman slippers or a knock-off of Lululemon's ultra-popular Define jacket can be a fantastic bargain.

Avant de s'exposer au soleil, on veille à protéger notre corps et notre visage. On choisit alors la bonne crème solaire, on l'applique méticuleusement sur les épaules, le dos, les bras, le visage, le cou... Pourtant, une zone manque souvent à l'appel. Si on met de la crème SPF sur le visage, on ne pense pas toujours aux lèvres. Les lèvres aussi ont besoin d'être protégées du soleil et de rester hydratées. La peau y est particulièrement fine et délicate, donc susceptible de prendre un coup de soleil. Comment reconnaître un coup de soleil sur les lèvres? Si vos lèvres ont trop pris le soleil et n'ont pas été protégées, en cas de coup de soleil léger, elles seront sèches et irritées. Si celui-ci est intense, des cloques blanches peuvent survenir, ainsi que des saignements. La lèvre inférieure sera très certainement la plus touchée, puisque c'est celle qui capte le plus la lumière. Comment traiter le coup de soleil sur les lèvres? Si le coup de soleil est léger, hydratez vos lèvres régulièrement. Vous pouvez utiliser de l'aloe vera que vous aurez au préalable laissé refroidir au réfrigérateur. L'irritation peut aussi être soulagée par un gant de toilette humide qui va rafraîchir la zone. N'arrachez pas la peau sèche, elle se détachera toute seule lorsque la nouvelle sera prête. Si le coup de soleil est intense, n'essayez pas de faire éclater les cloques. Laissez-les disparaître d'elles-mêmes. Elles peuvent rester de 5 à 15 jours, alors faites preuve de patience. Prenez le temps de laisser vos lèvres se remettre du coup de soleil, notamment en évitant de vous exposer aux rayons UV. De plus, n'utilisez pas de produits potentiellement irritants, contenant des acides alpha, bêta-hydroxy, des rétinoïdes ou des ingrédients qui font gonfler les lèvres. Pour favoriser la cicatrisation, appliquez une hydratation régulièrement sur vos lèvres qui renforcera la barrière cutanée. Comment prévenir les coups de soleil sur les lèvres? Certains baumes à lèvres sont conçus spécialement pour nous accompagner tout au long de l'été. Les soins pour les lèvres avec un SPF peuvent être appliqués quotidiennement, tout comme votre crème de jour et votre crème solaire. Pour prendre soin de votre bouche, ne les oubliez pas.

F9FF1ED945484C3B3A037914D4F5E44A,"  With the unforgiving ultraviolet rays beating down on them, lifeguards have to take extra care to protect their skin while keeping everyone else safe, too. We spoke with three certified lifeguards about their go-to sun protection strategies. ELISSA SANCI Lean into wearable sun protection. The best way to prevent sunburn is to keep your skin hidden from the sun. '' I try to stay as covered as possible even when it's pretty hot out,'' said Tess King, a Los Angeles County lifeguard. She wears a long-sleeve county-issued cotton sweatshirt when on duty. Other lifeguards opt for UV-protective clothing. Tommi Dubinski, a New York City--based lifeguard and emergency medical technician, is always decked out in protective sun clothing. One of her preferred items is the Outdoor Research Echo Hoodie, and she's a fan of Buff's UV neck gaiters. Wyatt Werneth, who has over 30 years of open-water lifeguarding experience in Cocoa Beach, Fla., said he keeps himself covered with a combination of sun shirts, sun hats and gaiters. Slather on the sunscreen, and reapply often. Wearing sunscreen is an extremely important part of sun safety. If you plan to spend long stretches of time outside, reapplying it multiple times is critical. At the beginning of her shift, Ms. King slathers herself in the sunscreen she's been using for 10 years: Blue Lizard Sensitive Mineral SPF 50 Sunscreen Lotion. She'll reapply Blue Lizard three to four times during her typical eight to 10 hours in the sun. Ms. King also swears by the tinted Vertra Sunscreen Face Stick SPF 38, which she uses as her primary face coverage. Ms. Dubinski's go-to body sunscreen is Supergoop Play Everyday Lotion SPF 50, a longtime Wirecutter pick. She likes that it doesn't feel tacky or greasy. Mr. Werneth keeps spray sunscreen on hand to use in a pinch. But if you do burn, this can help. Even the pros suffer from sunburn occasionally. The key is knowing how to treat the sting of your sunburn. '' Basic sunburn is considered a first-degree burn,'' Ms. Dubinski said, ''and the first thing we're taught in E.M.S. training is to stop the burn process. That could mean covering up, getting out of the sun, taking a cool shower.'' Once your skin is clean and cooled, reach for soothing topical creams. Ms. King treats her sunburns with Vanicream Moisturizing Cream.Elissa Sanci is a senior staff writer at Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company.

mov_5EFC5D643B1FB9B8AB77302CEE9055B5,"  A dry shampoo that's more reliable than your ex? Sounds divine. 1. A duo of Aquaphor Lip Repair tubes because I'm sure I'm not the only one suffering from extremely chapped lips. It's fragrance-and-paraben-free and filled with soothing shea butter and chamomile essence that'll help heal your lips in time for your next date night. Promising review: ""One of the best lip balms I've ever used. I love to sleep with it and wake up with my lips completely renewed. Highly recommended."" —Cintia Gomes Get a pack of two from Amazon for $8.36. 2. La Roche-Posay triple repair moisturizer helps revive the dry skin of everyone in your household. It's safe for babies, children, and adults, so it helps reduce the number of products on your bathroom vanity! It's non-greasy and formulated with shea butter and niacinamide to restore the skin's protective barrier. Promising review: ""Most people have already said it perfectly — this is extraordinary. I use it on my face at night and feel the moisturizing effects last through the next morning and beyond. I've tried dozens of products all across price ranges, and this is just super special. I love that it is a bit thick, and it feels really pure. I don't know what the magic is here, but whatever they did could easily cost 5x the price. It evens tone, helps with wrinkles, refines pores, skin glows, and does not irritate. It is great to see others also recognize that this cream is uniquely awesome!"" —Trever Fadrhonc Get it from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in two sizes). 3. Hawaiian Tropic's SPF 30 Mineral Powder Sunscreen Brush finally solves your dilemma over whether to spray/rub sunscreen onto your exposed scalp. Simply brush this translucent powder along your exposed part/hairline (after applying it all over your face, of course) to add some much-needed protection from the sun. Note that the AAD recommends using at least SPF 30 and reapplying as needed for skin protection. You can read about sunscreen myths and facts from dermatologists for more information! Promising review: ""Wish I would have found this sooner! Works great and so far the cheapest option I have found for powder sunscreen. Love that my face isn't greasy anymore from normal sunscreen!"" —Michelle ""I have fine hair so anytime I'm in the sun I get burnt on my scalp. Regular sunscreen make my hair super oily and gross and I cannot stand wearing hats. I'm so glad I found this. You do have to apply it more often, and also it doesn't work if it gets wet. Love this stuff, it's such a lifesaver."" —james Get it from Amazon for $16.99. Psst: if you're looking to add a bit more *pizzazz* to your skin protection, try out Supergoop! (Glow) setting Mineral Powder. I've been using it the same way I'd use this product, but loving that it leaves a subtle shimmer all over my skin! 4. A skin-firming neck and chest Gold Bond cream because chances are you've been neglecting these specific skin areas for years — well, now it's their time to shine! This cream is packed with hydrating hyaluronic acid and has been crafted to improve skin's elasticity and texture. TL;DR: you're welcome for introducing you to this magical stuff. Promising review: ""This product is the real deal. The first time I used it, I noticed a definite softening of the lines on my neck. I have been using it for about a week and it has made a noticeable difference. No, the wrinkles are not completely gone but there is a real difference....","A dry shampoo that's more reliable than your ex? Sounds divine. 1. A duo of Aquaphor Lip Repair tubes because I'm sure I'm not the only one suffering from extremely chapped lips. It's fragrance-and-paraben-free and filled with soothing shea butter and chamomile essence that'll help heal your lips in time for your next date night. Promising review: ""One of the best lip balms I've ever used. I love to sleep with it and wake up with my lips completely renewed. Highly recommended."" —Cintia Gomes Get a pack of two from Amazon for $8.36. 2. La Roche-Posay triple repair moisturizer helps revive the dry skin of everyone in your household. It's safe for babies, children, and adults, so it helps reduce the number of products on your bathroom vanity! It's non-greasy and formulated with shea butter and niacinamide to restore the skin's protective barrier. Promising review: ""Most people have already said it perfectly — this is extraordinary. I use it on my face at night and feel the moisturizing effects last through the next morning and beyond. I've tried dozens of products all across price ranges, and this is just super special. I love that it is a bit thick, and it feels really pure. I don't know what the magic is here, but whatever they did could easily cost 5x the price. It evens tone, helps with wrinkles, refines pores, skin glows, and does not irritate. It is great to see others also recognize that this cream is uniquely awesome!"" —Trever Fadrhonc Get it from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in two sizes). 3.

EAF08F5EC939AAFE9B96F88DE3FB95CB,"  MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage (I charge from £1,150 for mine). Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 (£19.55, www.amazon.co.uk), Olaplex No.8 (£22.40, www.sephora.co.uk) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer (£21, www.boots.com). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner (£27, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner (£26, www.harrods.com). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now £17.99, sha op.toni www.ndguy.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now £12, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo (£24.50, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment (£25). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

n33mu9w,"  Task stacking! My evening routine is where my heavy hitters are. And I save the majority of my social media usage for night time, so I can catch up with stuff while I'm doing my evening routine. Or saving a show or podcast for only that time. It's my ""me time"" for the day, so I take my time and decompress from the day and have really built a routine that I enjoy and look forward to doing. Helps give the task more dopamine. For mornings, the key is honestly to give yourself more time to do things slowly. I wake up earlier than I need to so my morning is padded with time if I just want to sit and read for a half an hour with my tea before getting going. And I keep my routine simple for the days I don't have the energy to do the whole song and dance. It looks something like this: * Quick shower (I have curly hair and only wash 1-2x per week) * Get face wet in shower * Rose water toner * Moisturizer * Glowscreen (tinted SPF from SuperGoop) * I have lash extensions specifically for this reason so I can stop here if I'm short on time or spoons, and still feel presentable * If I have time and am feeling it, I will do more involved makeup. And again, youtube, podcasts, audiobooks, RedNote with it's autoscroll feature are going to be key here. Pair the self care and getting ready with another task you enjoy. But remember to keep it moving, don't sit down and start getting super invested in something. Your media needs to be something you can have as a background.","Task stacking!

Nordstrom's 2025 Anniversary sale is basically the grand finale of the deal-packed month and will be live through Aug. 3. The Nordstrom Anniversary sale has been shoppable for select cardholders who get early access to the deals for a week now, but now it's open to the public. This is Nordstrom's biggest (and most anticipated) sale of the year—it's on par with their post-Thanksgiving deals. As per usual, Nordstrom's Anniversary sale catalog includes thousands of steep discounts across all categories, including designer clothing, luxury beauty exclusives, and elevated home decor staples from customer-favorite brands like La Mer, Barefoot Dreams, Allsaints, and Levi's, marked down up to 60 percent off. Plus, this year, Nordstrom has added over 100 new brands to the sale catalog that were off-limits in previous years, including Supergoop, Benefit, Osea, Moccamaster, Farm Rio, Naked Wardrobe, Proenza Schouler White Label, Cult Gaia, and L'Agence. Of course, there are also plenty of under $100 buys to score as well, including from brands like Augustinus Bader, Ugg, Spanx, T3, and New Balance. Items return to full price after Aug. 3, but in the past, popular items have sold out before the sale ends, so be sure to shop the sale ASAP.

This serum uses vitamin C, collagen, sodium hyaluronate, and lavender oil, all of which will help your skin look super glowy. Promising review: ""I ordered this product after a colleague had recommended it. I had developed some acne and scarring from wearing a face mask. Most of the acne was around my cheek area. Once masks weren't required anymore, I was a bit embarrassed by my skin's condition. I've only ever used face wash and didn't know the importance of moisturizing. This has helped clear up my skin and even it out. I've been using it for about four months now and only have very minimal scarring left. The price is worth it. I have actually been using it daily and use about 3–4 drops a day. Still have over half the bottle left. Definitely a good investment. It has a light fragrance and will help your skin look dewy without feeling oily."" —Lupita Luna Get it from Amazon for $31.50. 2. A skincare starter kit for those who need help setting up their routine. It comes with a gel cleanser, serum, and hydrating cream that'll help smooth your face and brighten it. It's glowy skin season, and there's no one I trust more for glowy skin than the Queen of Glow herself, J.Lo. Promising review: ""I usually don't order skin products from celebrities, but I happened to come across a review from a makeup artist who raved about this product. I decided to give it a try. These products are great. Leaves your skin soft and hydrated with a nice glow. Not greasy looking or shiny. I have applied foundation after applying, and it does not affect the foundation. Great product."" —christine Get the set from Amazon for $201. 3. A glowy sunscreen because once you start using this, you won't be able to stop (trust me, I know from experience.) Every single time I wear this glowy SPF, I instantly get a confidence boost, and everyone compliments me. I am a Glowscreen stan, I use this almost every day, and the amount of compliments I receive while wearing this are unreal. Like I said above, once I have this on, I feel like a glowing goddess, and it makes me want to do a mini photoshoot. So I hope it inspires you as much as it inspires me. Promising review: ""I have been on a search for a sunscreen that doesn't burn my eyes and skin, and I have finally found that with Supergoop. I don't wear much makeup on a daily basis, so this tinted sunscreen is what I use on the daily to give a tiny bit of glow. I actually went with the bronze because it is so sheer. I absolutely love the way it makes my skin look. I highly recommend this product."" —LizDT Get it from Sephora for $22+ (available in three sizes and four shades). 4.

Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage. Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 ((EURO)29.50, www.brownthomas.com), Olaplex No.8 ((EURO)29.50, www.arnotts.ie) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer ((EURO)24.45, www.lookfantastic.ie). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner ((EURO)31, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner ((EURO)30, www.boots.ie). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now (EURO)22.49, www.cloud10beauty.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now (EURO)14, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo ((EURO)28.20, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment ((EURO)28). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist....","by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round.

n3ez8zd,"  I'm almost finished with my first HaruHaru Wonder sunscreen (Airyfit) and I love it. I have tried everything from La Roche Posay, Elta MD (one of my favs though pricey), multiple Supergoop (no longer purchase this brand, see lawsuit), Neutrogena, Elf, Bum (something or other), Beauty of Joseon and more. So far my recent favorite is the HaruHaru Wonder Airyfit. I sadly purchased from Amazon so was extremely concerned I may have purchased a fake, I decided to do an all day wear test at the beach the other week. I used four different sunscreens (1 on each bottom half wrist/arm, left a gap in the middle for reference, 1 on each top part of my forearm). I used Elta MD Daily Tinted, Neutrogena Sport spf 70 (happened to have though don't really use), HaruHaru Wonder Airyfit and leftover Supergoop Play. It seems HaruHaru was in the lead with Elta MD, for being the lightest part(s) of the tested areas. Of course this is not a scientific test, though a visual to give me some idea as to how well they actually protect me.

mov_7AD64E646EA8A32B8C92BBA829236A0C,"  38 items in this article 38 items on sale! Photo-Illustration: The Strategist; Photos: Retailers Nordstorm's Anniversary Sale is one of my favorite sales of the year, so I went all in for today's end-of-week roundup. The beauty deals are always good, and you often find brands that don't get discounted throughout the year in the mix (like Natori, Bombas, and Ecco, to name a few). Speaking of beauty, we just got word that Ami Colé is closing down, so now's the time to stock up; its sale section is an extra 25 percent off until stock runs out. And if neither of those sales is for you, I found plenty more double discounts at Levi's, Madewell, Nordstrom Rack, and Anthropologie. Our best brief doesn't go on sale much, so I'd suggest stocking up while its 25 percent off. I finally hopped on the American Trench train and bought a pair of their socks a few weeks ago. I highly recommend; they're surprisingly breathable despite the thick sole and squishy upper part. This set of three is just $9 apiece. Sale items are an extra 40 percent off at checkout at Anthropologie. There are lots of options from Anthropologie's in-house lines, as usual, like this stretchy tank that's now $12. Sale styles are an extra 50 percent off at Levi's at the moment. If you must wear pants during the summer, I say go wtih the baggiest ones you can find — these Levi's are a strong contender. Another wide-leg, this time courtesy of Madewell, where lots of on-sale jeans are an extra 50 percent off with the code SUMMER. This is a good wash option if you don't want to pay hundreds for Japanese selvedge denim. These inky blue jeans since we wrote about them in March (a.k.a. Jeans Month) are also $50 — which is $7 cheaper than when I spotted them on sale last month. No code needed to score these jeans from Madewell's collection with Alexa Chung. Photo: Retailer Strategist contributor Sable Yong owns four pairs of these Gap jeans, which she says are, despite the semi-intimidating horseshoe shape, “casually flowy while not swallowing my footwear in their gaping maws.” If you're in the market for comfy shoes, the Nordstrom sale has quite a few options, like these unisex-fit dad sneakers from New Balance. Several actually cute Ecco sandals are on sale at Nordstrom, too, but you can also find the same discounts at Amazon and Zappos if you'd like two-day shipping. As for this heeled option, most sizes are $120 — but you're in luck if you're a size 10 to 10.5, because they're $88, a discount of 50 percent off! Everything in Camper's sale section is half off for members (which just requires you to sign up for emails). I'm eyeing these fisherman-esque sandals that have an especially cushy-looking sole. If you're looking for some non-basic swimsuits and coverups, Marie Oliver has some for up to 70 percent off. Continuing with some capsule wardrobe basics, this all-cotton tee is 40 percent off and comes in six nice neutrals. Two equally worthy denim shirts, depending on your wash preference. These unisex work shorts by Le Laboureur, a French family-owned brand that's been producing workwear since the 1950s, are over 40 percent off. They're made from cotton moleskin, a densely woven fabric with a sueded finish that develops a unique patina over time. We'll always recommend on-sale Supergoop! This three-pack of spritzable sunscreen is now just over $16 per bottle (normally $24). Under $100 La Mer alert! An excellent deal on Bathing Culture's moisture-trapping body oil. A nice-smelling natural deodorant that actually works, according to our associate editor Jeremy Rellosa. Sadly, Ami Colé is closing up shop. So its sale section, the Overflow Shelf, is an additional 25 percent off with the code OVERFLOW25. Grab the Telfar bag of lip gloss, a hydrating concealer, or a couple makeup brushes while you still can. Clearance items are an extra 25 percent off at Nordstrom Rack this weekend. I found some crazy-good deals on Hydro Flasks, like this 32-ounce bottle in white, indigo, and purple. (There's also one in teal on sale for $35.) Tekla who? Dorm essentials are 40 percent off at Urban Outfitters through the end of the weekend. I like this $41 cottage-inspired sheet set, which includes one pillowcase, a fitted sheet, and a flat sheet in the twin / twin XL size (bigger sizes come with two pillowcases). A huge step up from mesh laundry baskets. This is more apartment-y than dorm, but fun nonetheless. Finally, a fashion-forward apron. If you're shopping the Nordstrom sale, make sure to check out all the baby clothes on sale — there are a ton of cute onesies from brands we love like Magnetic Me and Pehr.
