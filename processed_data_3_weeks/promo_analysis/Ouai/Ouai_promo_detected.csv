Kiehls Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil 5.9 oz $28.50$38.0025% offBuy Now On Amazon A gentle but effective cleansing oil. The word oil can be triggering to some, especially those with oily skin. Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil is a cleanser you can trust, with an affordable price tag to boot. It's one you'll want to add to your arsenal for numerous reasons. This formula is packed with botanical oils that work gently to remove dirt, makeup and grime from the epidermis without leaving a greasy residue. Say hello to soft and supple skin. Squalane beefs up the formula by replenishing the skin's barrier. Simply lather a few pumps of the product onto the face, working in circular motions before washing away with water. Simple as that. T3 AireLuxe Professional Ionic Hair Dryer and Brush Set $142.49$209.9932% offBuy Now on amazon A hair dryer and two brush set. Three products for the price of one can never be wrong. Right now, you can get T3's AireLuxe Professional Ionic Hair Dryer along with a brush set for just $142.49. That's 32% off the bundle's original price. The included dryer is fitted with a custom-engineered fan that dries the hair 2x faster, while retaining natural moisture so you won't be left with dry or brittle locks. Both brushes are meant for styling while drying, working volume into your follicles without tugging or pulling. We can see these three pieces making a great gift for those just beginning their hair styling journey. Urban Decay All-Over Liquid Highlighter & Setting Spray Bundle $59.20$70.0015% offBuy Now On Amazon A duo set with a setting spray and a liquid highlighter. Another bundle you won't want to miss out on comes from Urban Decay, a brand beloved by 90s babies everywhere.

All Nighter is a cult favorite that keeps makeup fresh and hydrated for up to 16 hours. Face Bond Luminizer is a liquid highlighter of sorts that works to add a luminous shine when applied to the high points of the face. The glitzy drops can also be mixed into your favorite foundations to create a more luminous finish. The stand-out combo results in a glossy and long-wearing makeup look that will have you turning heads. Ouai St. Barts Body Cleanser Travel Size $11.20$14.0020% offBuy Now On Amazon A foaming body wash. Ouai is best known for their haircare product; however, they also cater to skincare needs. The brand's St. Barts Foaming Body Wash is an underrated hit, and it's currently on sale for $11.20.

The foaming wash is scented with Ouai's St. Barts fragrance, which features notes of dragon fruit, orange blossom, tuberose and musk that evoke vacations sat beneath a blooming tropical tree.

mov_A603EABFB6D36858A12EA2522C4A5DDD,"  I've dabbled in an array of hair growth solutions, including topical foams and oils to ingestible supplements. As someone who is constantly time-pressed—and, frankly, forgetful—however, I've struggled to maintain the necessary consistency to see results. The sole exception? Hair growth shampoo, which offers a streamlined, straightforward alternative to the aforementioned options. I've tried many—yet few have thickened my straggly strands like the Rosemary Shampoo from my favorite bodycare brand, Nécessiare. I'm stocking up while it's on rare sale during Amazon Prime Day. Nécessaire Rosemary Shampoo Amazon The Nécessaire Rosemary Shampoo is a drug-free, plant-powered cleanser for fine, thinning, breakage-prone hair. Packed with its titular ingredient, the formula promotes new growth; moreover, it strengthens existing strands to mitigate excessive shedding, prevent premature snapping, and yield longer, healthier-looking hair. The formula's key ingredient, rosemary, boasts benefits beyond the culinary realm. According to science, the herb is equally powerful in the beauty sphere as a growth-proliferating hair care ingredient. Specifically, rosemary extract improves blood flow to the scalp—in turn, providing hair follicles with nutrients and stimulating new growth. Notably, one study even found rosemary to be as effective as minoxidil (the active ingredient in products like Rogaine) for staving off certain forms of hair loss. Nécessaire Rosemary Shampoo With Pump Amazon In addition to fuller, stronger, longer hair, Nécessaire's Rosemary Shampoo softens and smooths—while adding bounce and shine—after a single use. The formula is available in an 8.4-ounce size and a larger 16.9-ounce size, contained in a pump-style bottle. I'm doubling down on rosemary's thickening benefits with the corresponding Nécessaire Rosemary Conditioner. I'd be remiss to omit the olfactory bliss this shampoo emits once lathered: A meld of herbaceous, spa-like notes turns my shower into an instant oasis of calm. Plus, the packaging adds a touch of elegant, cool-girl sophistication to my bathroom. I'm hardly alone in my love for Nécessaire's Rosemary Shampoo. One shopper who had struggled with postpartum hair loss said their “hair is growing back in so rapidly” after three months of using the formula in combination with the corresponding conditioner. Another fan dubbed it an “awesome product for [treating] hair loss,” citing stronger strands and significantly less shedding within three months of incorporating the shampoo into their routine. Finally, another shopper with “thin” hair said their mane feels “thicker” after only a week. For fuller, bouncier, longer hair, shop the Nécessaire Rosemary Shampoo at Amazon before it returns to full price. Consider similar options below.

There's no compliment quite like being told you smell amazing. You could have your makeup perfectly done, your hair styled flawlessly, and be wearing your best outfit, but a simple “you smell so good” will always make you swoon. Perfume can be expensive, and usually the most captivating scents can come with the highest price tags. Fortunately (and also unfortunately for anyone hoping it would never end), today is the last day of Amazon Prime Day's big summer sale, and the perfume deals are seriously impressive. We've rounded up 12 must-see fragrance finds, including cult favorites you already love, scents you've been meaning to try, and a few trending picks you may not have discovered yet.

These Prime Day perfume deals end tonight! Shop now before they're gone. OUAI Melrose Place Eau de Parfum The scent that makes all your Ouai hair treatments, oils, and scrubs smell so good is in perfume form. This beautiful floral scent has top notes of champagne, pink peppercorn, berry and lychee with base notes of amber, sandalwood, white musk and cedarwood, and middle notes of peony, rose, freesia, jasmine and bergamot. Get it for 20% off during Prime Day. Salt & Stone Body Mist Paige DeSorbo says Salt & Stone products make her smell ""expensive."" Now you can smell expensive for even less.

Its scent notes include: saffron, neroli, jasmine, oakmoss, surf wax, sugar cane, and cedarwood. Lancôme La Vie Est Belle Eau de Parfum The name of this fragrance translates to ""life is beautiful."" And we think the fact that it's 30% off right now is pretty beautiful too. It features notes of Iris spring flowers and patchouli, layered alongside spun sugar and warm vanilla.

It features notes of juicy tangerine, soft heliotrope, and elegant orchid. According to the brand, it has a rich tropical and gourmand heart, and settles into a warm vanilla, sandalwood and musk. Juicy Couture Viva La Juicy Eau De Parfum She's bright, she's fun, she's sensual, she's nostagic, she is Viva La Juicy! This playful, sweet floral fragrance features a dry-down of creamy vanilla caramel and sensual amber, plus pops of vibrant berries, sweet honeysuckle and a pucker of mandarin.
