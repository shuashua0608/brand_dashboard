The U.S. color cosmetics market was valued at USD 21.52 billion in 2024, with projections indicating a rise to USD 35.52 billion by 2030, demonstrating a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.8% during the forecast period of 2025 to 2030. This expansion is significantly propelled by the growth of e-commerce and technological advancements that have revolutionized the industry. Consumers now have easier access to a diverse array of products, while brands can engage with a wider audience through digital channels. Innovations like augmented reality (AR) virtual try-ons have elevated the online shopping experience, allowing users to visualize products before purchase, thereby enhancing both convenience and personalization. Social media platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, have become instrumental in shaping beauty trends and influencing consumer choices. Beauty influencers and makeup artists leverage these platforms to share tutorials, product reviews, and new techniques, directly impacting purchasing decisions. Brands are increasingly utilizing social media for product launches, audience engagement, and the creation of viral trends to boost sales and cultivate brand loyalty. A notable trend in 2024 is the rapid growth of the men's grooming and skincare market, driven by evolving societal norms and the strong influence of platforms like TikTok, where hashtags such as #mensskincare have gained widespread popularity. This trend reflects a shifting perspective on masculinity, encouraging more men to adopt skincare and beauty routines, prompting brands to develop product lines specifically tailored for male consumers. Key Market Dynamics & Insights: Facial Color Cosmetics Dominance: In 2024, facial color cosmetics held a share of approximately 39.03% of the U.S. color cosmetics market. This is attributed to their fundamental role in daily beauty routines and the extensive range of products within this category. Hypermarkets and Supermarkets as Key Distribution Channels: Sales through hypermarkets and supermarkets accounted for roughly 34.14% of the total U.S. color cosmetics market in 2024.

1lozl9k,"  Hello! I would really appreciate your help! I'm trying to build a simple, long-lasting base routine for both daily wear and small glam events. My skin is sensitive, acne-prone, and combination, so I really need something that: * Doesn't clog pores or break me out * Feels lightweight and comfortable * Lasts all day (I'm usually out from 6:30 AM to 7:30 PM, with gym after work — I can wash my face before the gym to remove makeup, but sometimes it's a hassle. That said, I'd rather have healthy skin, and the weather in my region is extremely hot in the summer and very cold in the winter) * I will be using that one product all over my face thinly for when I have events and such, but I only do that when there is something going on which is maximum 12 times a year and maybe even less. * Is actually worth the money (no fading, caking, or separating) **Budget for makeup:** I'd rather avoid expensive products that break the bank, but I'm willing to spend if it's something I'll truly use and not regret buying. I will be using that single product for a year or two, depending on its shelf life. Right now, I'm looking at these (ChatGPT suggested them, lol): # Base * [Dior Forever Skin Correct Concealer](https://www.dior.com/en_us/beauty/products/dior-forever-skin-correct-Y0326000.html) * [Tower 28 Swipe Serum Concealer](https://www.tower28beauty.com/products/swipe-serum-concealer) * [NARS Soft Matte Complete Foundation](https://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/soft-matte-complete-foundation/999NAC0000112.html) * [Haus Labs Triclone Skin Tech Concealer](https://www.hauslabs.com/products/triclone-skin-tech-concealer) * [Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Concealer](https://www.lancome-usa.com/makeup/face-makeup/concealers/teint-idole-ultra-wear-all-over-full-coverage-concealer/00422-LAC.html) * [Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation (2023)](https://www.lancome-usa.com/makeup/face-makeup/foundation/teint-idole-ultra-wear-foundation/00716-LAC.html) * [NARS Light Reflecting™ Foundation](https://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/light-reflecting%E2%84%A2-advanced-skincare-foundation/999NAC0000141.html) * [NARS Natural Radiant Longwear Foundation](https://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/natural-radiant-longwear-foundation/999NAC0000065.html) * [Natasha Denona Hy-Glam Concealer](https://natashadenona.com/products/hy-glam-concealer) * [Shiseido Synchro Skin Self-Refreshing Foundation](https://international.shiseido.co.jp/products/shiseido-synchro-skin-self-refreshing-foundation-1012176130SHI.html) * [Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay-in-Place Foundation](https://www.esteelauder.com/product/643/22830/product-catalog/makeup/face/foundation/double-wear/stay-in-place-foundation) # Blush & Setting Powder * [Huda Beauty Mini “Baby Bake” Easy Bake Loose Setting Powder](https://hudabeauty.com/us/en_US/powder-and-setting-spray/baby-bake-easy-bake-loose-powder-mini-banana-bread-HB01420.html) * [Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder Ultra-Blur Mini](https://www.lauramercier.com/products/translucent-loose-setting-powder-ultra-blur-mini) * [Tower 28 BeachPlease Lip + Cheek Cream Blush](https://www.tower28beauty.com/products/beachplease-luminous-tinted-balm-blush) * [e.l.f.

But I'm wondering if it's overkill for me, since I usually apply a very light base just to cover acne spots and under-eyes. Plus there was a reformulation recently and I am not sure if it's still safe for my skin. I still have my Infallible Concealer from 2.5 years ago, but I hate how it sits on my skin—it's too dry looking and breaks down weirdly by the end of the day. **Skin routine (if helpful):** * [BABÉ Super Fluid Sunscreen Mattifying SPF 50 (with Niacinamide)](https://laboratoriosbabe.com/en/product/super-fluid-sunscreen-mattifying-spf-50/) ([laboratoriosbabe.com](https://laboratoriosbabe.com/en/product/super-fluid-sunscreen-mattifying-spf-50/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))  (my favorite—the only one that doesn't break me out) * [La Roche-Posay Effaclar Duo+M Anti-Blemish Corrective Gel Moisturiser](https://www.laroche-posay.co.uk/en_GB/effaclar-duom-anti-blemish-corrective-gel-moisturiser/LRP_174.html) ([laroche-posay. co.uk](https://www.laroche-posay.co.uk/en_GB/effaclar-duom-anti-blemish-corrective-gel-moisturiser/LRP_174.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) (only when i am dry) * [Bioderma Pigmentbio Foaming Cream Brightening Cleanser](https://www.bioderma.ae/our-products/pigmentbio/foaming-cream) ([bioderma.ae](https://www.bioderma.ae/our-products/pigmentbio/foaming-cream?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) (morning and night) * [Bioderma Sensibio Foaming Gel](https://www.bioderma.us/en/p/sensibio-foaming-gel.html) ([bioderma.us](https://www.bioderma.us/en/p/sensibio-foaming-gel.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) (before and after the gym) * [Sesderma Azelac RU (depigmenting line)](https://www.sesderma.com/es_en/facial-care/collection/azelac-ru/) ([sesderma.com](https://www.sesderma.com/es_en/facial-care/collection/azelac-ru/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)) (my dermatologist originally recommended pairing it with Sesderma C-Vit, but it was out of budget—and the pharmacist said it might worsen acne, so I never bought it) I will be visiting my dermatologist soon, so this might change, but it's unlikely.

643036D9764BDB3BD8714AA12B0943BD,"  New Delhi, July 4 -- India's copycat economy is coming under pressure as global brands are starting to fight back. On Tuesday the Delhi High Court revived a long-pending lawsuit by American shoemaker Crocs Inc. against brands such as Bata, Liberty and Relaxo for copying its signature clog shoe design. The case, filed in 2014, had been pending for years before the court revived it this week. While the Crocs suit targets physical retailers, the copycat challenge for global brands has also moved online. Lookalike products that were once confined to local markets or grey channels are easily available on major e-commerce platforms. Some of these copies fall into the category of ""dupes"", which imitate the style of high-end products without logos and often remain in a legal grey zone, but others cross into counterfeiting by replicating trademarks. Digital marketplaces are flooded with lookalikes. A Rs.2-lakh Hermes sandal copy is listed for Rs.599 on one platform while replicas of Tory Burch handbags appear on another. Knockoffs of Marc Jacobs sling bags are available, too. You can also buy a replica of an Rs.18,000 Labubu doll-created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung-for less than Rs.1,000. Industry executives said this pointed to a growing ""dupe economy"" in India, where platforms host products en masse that mimic global designs, while mostly avoiding legal consequences. French brand Longchamp's signature nylon totes have inspired lookalikes at a leading retail chain and Birkenstock-style cork sandals, priced at Rs.5,000-8,000, are being sold for as little as Rs.1,000 online. Social media is driving much of this demand, with influencers on platforms such as Instagram and YouTube frequently showcasing budget versions of high-end goods, contributing to the sales growth of lookalike products. Abhay Gupta, founder of Delhi-based consultancy Luxury Connect, said, ""The explosion of social media platforms and dominant e-commerce sites has made it nearly impossible to track the spread of luxury fakes and dupes. It's threatening the luxury industry's integrity, discouraging genuine buyers, and diluting brand value. We need stricter intellectual property enforcement and strong action against these platforms. A unified industry voice along with platform accountability is crucial."" Gupta said India is becoming an important luxury market and such practices could dilute its global credibility. ""When mass platforms allow lookalikes of Hermes or Coach to flourish, they send a dangerous message-that originality is optional. If India wants to be taken seriously in the luxury ecosystem, we need sharper policing, better consumer awareness, and greater platform responsibility,"" he said. According to data available online, more than 64% of the world's fake luxury goods are produced in China. In 2021, counterfeit goods accounted for $467 billion in global trade. In India, a 2023 report by ASSOCHAM said 5% of all luxury apparel sold was counterfeit. Amazon said last week that its global Counterfeit Crimes Unit has helped secure over $180 million in court-ordered penalties and prosecuted more than 65 individuals worldwide since 2020, including in India. ""That said, people buying fakes were probably never the customers of the original,"" said Neelesh Hundekari, partner at global consultancy Kearney, who specialises in retail and luxury. ""But if they buy [fakes] out of aspiration, they may become future [genuine] buyers. Most genuine buyers are generally aware of where they can buy originals, but if there aren't enough genuine channels available then these buyers may also end up being cheated."" In mid-June Mint was able to find fakes of several luxury and high-end brands such as Saint Laurent and Tory Burch handbags on Amazon India in mid June. These were priced around Rs.7,000-well below the price of the original products. We sent several queries about this to Amazon on 18 June, to which it said it operates as a third-party marketplace where sellers list and sell products in accordance with applicable laws and selling policies. A spokesperson said, ""We have a zero tolerance policy for counterfeit products and continuously monitor our marketplace. We act quickly to protect customers and brands, including removing counterfeit listings and blocking accounts. We have several brand protection programs under which we collaborate with brands to protect our customers from bad actors attempting to abuse our marketplace."" Some listings were removed after we sent the queries, but new ones have since surfaced with slightly altered brand names. FirstCry, which was advertising fake Labubu dolls through Instagram ads until late last month, did not respond to Mint's queries.The listings were later taken down. Meesho declined to comment on specific products but said its Project Suraksha initiative has multiple strategies to tackle counterfeits and educate sellers. A spokesperson for Myntra said the platform ensures only authorised brands are listed, and has strict systems in place to check authenticity. However, it added that design decisions rest with the brands themselves. Swati Sharma, partner and head of intellectual property at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said India's laws do provide protection against counterfeit goods and misleading listings, but enforcement remains weak and reactive. ""Products that copy a luxury brand's design or logo qualify as counterfeits,"" she said. . She added that courts have taken a strict view in such cases, holding marketplaces accountable when they have promoted or enabled the sale of such products and granting remedies including injunctions, raids, seizures and damages. Despite these challenges, several global luxury brands have secured legal victories in India in recent months. In 2024 the Delhi High Court barred two businessmen from selling fake Louis Vuitton goods through platforms 'Mr. Shoes' and 'Mr. Retail,' ruling they had misused the brand's name. In June, Huda Beauty obtained an injunction against Vision Enterprises, which had imported 28,368 counterfeit cosmetics intercepted at Kolkata Port. Noida-based intellectual property lawyer Safir Anand of Anand & Anand said influencers who promote lookalike products could also face legal consequences. ""Such practices erode brand value, betray consumer trust, and are not protected under law,"" he said. He added that even if influencers don't claim a product is original, promoting it as a cheaper version can still amount to ""passing off"" and may thus violate IP laws.

On the current seventh season of the popular reality dating show, Madix, 40, seriously stepped up her game for her second round as host. Her looks have been more wide-ranging than ever, shocking fans with jaw-dropping hair color transformations and super-sexy ensembles. Hairstylist tells PEOPLE that he knew Madix would be a ""chameleon"" this season. ""The main goal was to make it completely different from last year. Every episode had to feel fresh,"" he says of preparing for filming the series in Fiji. ""We injected a bit of edge, some '90s references, girly vibes, high-fashion moments and sexy looks,"" Bembridge explains. ""One thing I've noticed is that we've played with a lot more curly and wavy hairstyles this time around, especially that mermaid texture. I actually told Ariana, 'This is giving , [the 1984 film] with Daryl Hannah,' so I nicknamed her Mer-Madix."" In order to achieve the roster of looks he'd dreamed up, the hairstylist packed accordingly. ""I brought three suitcases and one of them was completely full of hairpieces: wigs, clip-ins, bangs, different lengths, different shades,"" he shares. ""So in total, around came with me. My girls have to have options!"" Aside from Madix's beachy, mermaid-inspired waves, the star has rocked a dramatic brunette wig, a Rapunzel-like braid and piece-y bangs — and the season is not over yet. For makeup artist , her creations are a collaborative effort between other members of the glam team and Madix herself. ""Most of it came together on the day,"" Dawn tells PEOPLE. ""We'd see what [Ariana] was wearing, chat about what vibe she felt like. Sometimes she'd have inspo pics, and then we'd match it up with the hair look, too. If her hair was pulled back, we might do a winged eye; if she had a fringe, we'd keep it fresh and focus more on blush and lips."" When it comes to preserving Madix's makeup in the scorching island heat, Dawn says good skin prep and a solid base are crucial. ""I've been using the Milk Hydro Grip Primer, sometimes the original and sometimes the illuminating one for extra glow. For foundation, NARS and Haus Labs have been real heroes — they hold up way better on Ariana's skin than what we used last year. Huda Beauty's new setting spray is a game-changer too."" Surprisingly, Dawn doesn't use a lot of powder to combat sweat and shine. ""We don't like her skin to look overly matte or cakey, so I keep powder really minimal,"" she explains. ""Just a light dusting near the end, and then a final mist of setting spray right before she goes on. There's no heavy baking. Once she's out there for hours, you sometimes just have to trust the prep — so far, so good!"" Because stylist isn't on set with Madix in Fiji, she has to be bit more meticulous about her planning (she says she sent the host off with three checked suitcases full of clothes!) . ""We have a big fitting in the week before she leaves to try everything on and decide what we like and don't like,"" she explains. ""Then, I accessorize everything and pair each outfit with jewelry, shoes, undergarments — all the things! I try to consider every detail and angle for each outfit, even down to her nails."" The stylist has been loving press-ons for their versatility, and so she can switch Madix's nails with every look. Men adds that she personally tailors all of Madix's clothes and ensures everything fits perfectly at a second fitting before she leaves for filming. ""If any last-minute adjustments need to be made, we are so lucky to have the on-set wardrobe team of , and , who are amazing and able to sort out any last-minute issues! "" Never miss a story — sign up for  to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. While she and Madix always prepare mood boards based on what's inspiring them, Men says that confidence is always an underlying theme. ""Ariana and I work so well together because she is open to trying anything and everything,"" says the stylist. ""She is so comfortable in her own skin that she can effortlessly pull off so many different looks, and that confidence really shines through."" ""Also, you have to give a lot of credit to her amazing glam team, Carl Bembridge and Krystal Dawn — we all work together on these looks and make sure each component complements the others!""","From lugging 70 pounds of hair to Fiji to battling the island heat, Madix's team shares all NEED TO KNOW 's fashion and beauty moments on deserve a show of their own.

For makeup artist , her creations are a collaborative effort between other members of the glam team and Madix herself. ""Most of it came together on the day,"" Dawn tells PEOPLE. ""We'd see what [Ariana] was wearing, chat about what vibe she felt like. Sometimes she'd have inspo pics, and then we'd match it up with the hair look, too. If her hair was pulled back, we might do a winged eye; if she had a fringe, we'd keep it fresh and focus more on blush and lips."" When it comes to preserving Madix's makeup in the scorching island heat, Dawn says good skin prep and a solid base are crucial. ""I've been using the Milk Hydro Grip Primer, sometimes the original and sometimes the illuminating one for extra glow. For foundation, NARS and Haus Labs have been real heroes — they hold up way better on Ariana's skin than what we used last year. Huda Beauty's new setting spray is a game-changer too."" Surprisingly, Dawn doesn't use a lot of powder to combat sweat and shine. ""We don't like her skin to look overly matte or cakey, so I keep powder really minimal,"" she explains. ""Just a light dusting near the end, and then a final mist of setting spray right before she goes on. There's no heavy baking. Once she's out there for hours, you sometimes just have to trust the prep — so far, so good!"" Because stylist isn't on set with Madix in Fiji, she has to be bit more meticulous about her planning (she says she sent the host off with three checked suitcases full of clothes!) . ""We have a big fitting in the week before she leaves to try everything on and decide what we like and don't like,"" she explains. ""Then, I accessorize everything and pair each outfit with jewelry, shoes, undergarments — all the things! I try to consider every detail and angle for each outfit, even down to her nails."" The stylist has been loving press-ons for their versatility, and so she can switch Madix's nails with every look. Men adds that she personally tailors all of Madix's clothes and ensures everything fits perfectly at a second fitting before she leaves for filming. ""If any last-minute adjustments need to be made, we are so lucky to have the on-set wardrobe team of , and , who are amazing and able to sort out any last-minute issues! "" Never miss a story — sign up for to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. While she and Madix always prepare mood boards based on what's inspiring them, Men says that confidence is always an underlying theme.

""She is so comfortable in her own skin that she can effortlessly pull off so many different looks, and that confidence really shines through."" ""Also, you have to give a lot of credit to her amazing glam team, Carl Bembridge and Krystal Dawn — we all work together on these looks and make sure each component complements the others!""",2025-07-04 22:00:00,en,WEB,,,,67b25fe070f17c815e676329e1908c3b,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This appears to be a genuine article about Ariana Madix's styling and makeup for a reality show.

Looking forward, IMARC Group estimates the market to reach USD 14.40 billion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 6.0% from 2025-2033. Download a sample PDF of this report: https://www.imarcgroup.com/gcc-cosmetics-market/requestsample Growth Factors in the GCC Cosmetics Market ● Rising Disposable Income The GCC region, especially the UAE and Saudi Arabia, has seen an increase in disposable income. This growth drives the cosmetics market forward. As people earn more, they spend more on luxury beauty products. They look for high-quality formulas and attractive packaging. This economic boom draws global brands like L'Oréal and Estée Lauder to the area. These brands serve the expanding middle and upper classes. Duty-free shops at Dubai and Riyadh airports have seen a rise in high-end cosmetics sales. Consumers are keen to invest in products that enhance their looks and confidence. ● Increasing Consumer Awareness Awareness of personal grooming and wellness is boosting demand for cosmetics in the GCC. Influencers share products and routines, influencing preferences. Many people now prefer skin health products, like vitamin C serums. A key example is the ""Gen Z's Skincare Evolution in GCC: Unfiltered"" report by Chalhoub Group and Meta. ● Expanding Working Women Population More women are joining the workforce in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. This change is boosting growth. More women are entering professional roles, creating a higher demand for cosmetics that support a polished look. For example, Saudi Arabia saw a rise in female labor force participation in 2024. This boosted the need for long-lasting makeup and skincare for busy schedules. Brands like Huda Beauty have taken advantage of this trend. They offer products designed for professional women, such as durable foundations and lipsticks. This focus has helped the market grow significantly. Key Trends in the GCC Cosmetics Market ● Demand for Natural and Organic Products Consumers in the GCC are seeking natural, organic, and eco-friendly cosmetics. Their concerns about synthetic ingredients and the environment drive this trend. Brands like Asteri, a Saudi-based company, have gained popularity by offering vegan makeup. They use local ingredients like moringa and date seed oil. This trend fits a broader shift toward sustainable living. Many consumers now give high rankings to cruelty-free and ethically sourced products. Retailers are responding by expanding their clean beauty lines. They ensure their formulations are free from harmful chemicals. This approach resonates with health-conscious buyers across the region. ● Growth of E-Commerce and Social Media Influence E-commerce and social media have changed the GCC cosmetics market. Products are now easier to find, and brands gain more visibility. Platforms like Instagram and YouTube influence buying decisions through endorsements and tutorials. For instance, Sisley Paris launched an e-commerce channel for GCC countries in 2021.

n1tmsj9,"  I really like the Nyx skin tint with spf. BUT. A skin tint with spf WILL NOT give you enough spf protection throughout the day. You need to apply 1/4 teaspoon of spf on your face and neck. But I love it as a skin tint regardless of the spf. I just don't want people to think that they're getting protection bc of it. I have an Ilia one and this smokes it performance wise. I've converted to the One/Size setting powder. I've tried Elf, L'Oreal, Huda, Hourglass, Laura Mercier (one of the worst for a cakey finish) and O/S or Kimchi (I think they're mostly online) give me the best and longest wear. I like Huda a lot, but it doesn't give me all day. You can get the sample sizes that will last forever to try them out. Halo glow is gorgeous on the skin but looks weird on my forehead... I don't know how to describe it other than that lol. I don't recall wear time on it. For bronzer. . I love the liquid Mario one. I'm kinda meh on his other products but love that. I recently got the Nyx one and she's great too, but you just have to be so careful to not over apply bc it is so pigmented it ends up being a lot of work. LOVE Juvias place for a matte bronzer. I'm very pale and it is one of the few bronzers that really works for me. (the Nyx fairest shade is orange, so I did have to go second lightest to get a bronzed color). Blush... Can't go wrong with elf! I also love the Juvias place liquids (especially their blush lighter) but it's like Rare Beauty pigmented lol. If you want to go online I love all things Moira as well. Maybelline Sky High is my favorite, with Tarte tubing (purple bottle) a close second. I rotate between the two pretty frequently. I'm 43, so the trick with concealer is less is more. Do not swipe it on your face like a lot of influencers do. I dab it on the back of my hand, then use the tiny sponges From real techniques to apply. Let it dry, pat out any creases, then set with powder. Eyeshadow. . Colourpop and Nyx are great. I'm very hooded and oily. I prime, powder, eyeshadow, bake, then top with a sparkly shade. Get crazy long wear since I started baking my first layer of shadow. Put it on heavy since the bake will lighten the color. I like the Mac primer (not the pots... Zero stars on the pots), Thank Me Later by Elizabeth Mott (cheap on Amazon) and Urban Decay in that order. Okay I wrote a novel. If you only take one thing from this... Sunscreen. Sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen. 1/4 tsp. You just keep rubbing it til it works into your skin.

Dubai, United Arab Emirates – July 7, 2025 – GS1 today marked 25 years of its presence in the country – empowering businesses and government entities with globally trusted standards that drive transparency, efficiency, and safety across supply chains. The milestone celebration coincides closely with a historic moment in global commerce today: in June of 1974, the very first product was scanned using a GS1 barcode in a supermarket in Ohio, USA. What began as a simple scan of a pack of chewing gum sparked a revolution in how the world tracks, sells, and understands products. Today, GS1 UAE stands at the forefront of that same legacy — helping businesses in the UAE digitize, standardize, and future-proof their operations. Since its establishment in 2000 in the United Arab Emirates, GS1 UAE has played a pivotal role in the UAE's digital transformation journey. Its globally recognized barcoding, data and traceability standards have become the backbone of key sectors as diverse as retail, healthcare, logistics, manufacturing, and e-commerce. Over the years, GS1 UAE has established strategic collaborations with several key government bodies, including the Federal Tax Authority (FTA), where its standards have been instrumental in enabling excise tax compliance and the traceability of Digital Tax Stamps. GS1 UAE has also supported the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) through initiatives like Tatmeen that ensure the authentication of medical products, helping safeguard public health and align with national pharmaceutical safety goals. In the healthcare sector, GS1 UAE has partnered with health authorities such as Dubai Health, Emirates Drug Establishment,and Emirates Health Services,as well as hospitals such as Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi,and manufacturer associations such as Mecomed and Pharmag to implement serialization and traceability systems that strengthen patient safety, combat counterfeiting for pharmaceuticals and facilitate unique identification for medical devices. GS1's barcoding solutions in the retail and e-commerce industries have improved inventory accuracy, pricing consistency, and consumer trust, in collaboration with the likes of Dubai Duty Free, Al Ghurair, Transmed, Huda Beauty, Jumbo Electronics, Barakat, and Al Douri, to name a few. “As we mark this important milestone, we reflect not only on our impact in the private sector but also on the strong partnerships we've built with UAE government institutions to promote trust and transparency at scale,” said Rami Habbal, CEO of GS1 UAE. “From healthcare safety and regulatory compliance to consumer transparency and sustainability, GS1 UAE remains committed to delivering globally trusted standards that help the UAE lead in innovation.” Looking to the future, GS1 UAE is aligned with the global transition to next-generation QR codes powered by GS1 that will unlock richer trusted data at the point of sale.

The milestone celebration coincides closely with a historic moment in global commerce today: in June of 1974, the very first product was scanned using a GS1 barcode in a supermarket in Ohio, USA. What began as a simple scan of a pack of chewing gum sparked a revolution in how the world tracks, sells, and understands products. Today, GS1 UAE stands at the forefront of that same legacy — helping businesses in the UAE digitize, standardize, and future-proof their operations.

Its globally recognized barcoding, data and traceability standards have become the backbone of key sectors as diverse as retail, healthcare, logistics, manufacturing, and e-commerce. Over the years, GS1 UAE has established strategic collaborations with several key government bodies, including the Federal Tax Authority (FTA), where its standards have been instrumental in enabling excise tax compliance and the traceability of Digital Tax Stamps. GS1 UAE has also supported the Ministry of Health and Prevention (MoHAP) through initiatives like Tatmeen that ensure the authentication of medical products, helping safeguard public health and align with national pharmaceutical safety goals. In the healthcare sector, GS1 UAE has partnered with health authorities such as Dubai Health, Emirates Drug Establishment,and Emirates Health Services,as well as hospitals such as Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi,and manufacturer associations such as Mecomed and Pharmag to implement serialization and traceability systems that strengthen patient safety, combat counterfeiting for pharmaceuticals and facilitate unique identification for medical devices. GS1's barcoding solutions in the retail and e-commerce industries have improved inventory accuracy, pricing consistency, and consumer trust, in collaboration with the likes of Dubai Duty Free, Al Ghurair, Transmed, Huda Beauty, Jumbo Electronics, Barakat, and Al Douri, to name a few. “As we mark this important milestone, we reflect not only on our impact in the private sector but also on the strong partnerships we've built with UAE government institutions to promote trust and transparency at scale,” said Rami Habbal, CEO of GS1 UAE. “From healthcare safety and regulatory compliance to consumer transparency and sustainability, GS1 UAE remains committed to delivering globally trusted standards that help the UAE lead in innovation.” Looking to the future, GS1 UAE is aligned with the global transition to next-generation QR codes powered by GS1 that will unlock richer trusted data at the point of sale.

[CMN 특별취재팀] 대한화장품산업연구원은 최근 발간한 글로벌 코스메틱 포커스 4호 인도, 인도네시아편에서 “(K-뷰티는) 마케팅 측면에서 현지화 전략을 통해 현지 소비자에게 친숙함을 어필하는 것이 필요하다”고 강조했다.
K-뷰티는 인도 소비자들 사이에서 여전히 트렌디하고 선망의 대상으로 인식되고 있다. 뚜렷한 포인트 메이크업을 선호하던 트렌드가 투명하고 맑은 피부 표현, 은은한 블러셔, 연한 컨투어링 등 자연스러운 한국식 메이크업으로 이동했다.
기미나 잡티 없이 유리처럼 맑고 매끄러운 피부를 연상시키는 한국식 스킨케어도 인기다. 얼굴, 모발, 입술 등 전반적인 피부관리에 한국산 화장품을 선호하는 추세다.
이처럼 K-뷰티의 영향력은 여전하지만 인도 로컬 브랜드들은 소비자들의 수요에 기반한 제품을 개발하고, 유통 채널을 다변화하면서 시장의 주도권을 강화하고 있다. 인도 정부도 신규 브랜드 프로그램과 같은 다양한 지원 사업을 통해 현지 화장품 산업 성장을 뒷받침하고 있다.
K-뷰티, 인도 주류 트렌드로 부상
K-뷰티의 글로벌 확산에 따라 인도에서도 그 영향력은 뚜렷하게 감지되고 있다. 과거 인도 뷰티 시장은 윤곽 강조, 도톰한 입술, 각진 눈썹과 같은 뚜렷한 포인트 메이크업 중심의 서구 스타일이 주를 이뤘다.
그러나 최근에는 K-뷰티 특유의 투명하고 맑은 피부 표현, 은은한 블러셔, 연한 컨투어링 등 자연스러운 메이크업으로 미적 기준이 이동하고 있다.
K-뷰티는 스킨케어 방법에도 영향을 미쳤다. 한국 뷰티의 핵심인 레이어링(Layering) 개념이 인도 소비자들 사이에서 확산돼 예전보다 더 많은 단계의 스킨케어 루틴이 일상화됐고, 이로 인해 인도 시장에서 화장품의 사용량과 카테고리 자체가 확대됐다. 이와 같은 변화는 단지 한국 화장품의 인기 상승에 그치지 않고 현지 기업들의 제품 개발, 브랜드 및 유통업체의 마케팅 전략에도 영향을 미치고 있다.
인도 배우 카리나 카푸어 칸(Kareena Kapoor Khan)과 슈가 코스메틱스(Sugar Cosmetics)의 공동 창업자 비네타 싱(Vineeta Singh)이 함께 론칭한 K-뷰티 콘셉트 기반의 스킨케어 브랜드 퀜치 보타닉스(Quench Botanics)가 대표적인 사례다. 이 브랜드는 메이드 인 코리아를 전면에 내세우며 쌀뜨물, 유자, 대나무 등 한국산 자연 유래 성분을 활용한 제품을 한국에서 생산해 인도에서 판매하고 있다.
나이카는 지난 4월 25일부터 27일까지 아모레퍼시픽 데이를 개최해 라네즈, 이니스프리, 에뛰드 등의 대규모 마케팅 캠페인을 전개했고, 인도 뷰티 플랫폼 카인드라이프(Kindlife)는 올해 자국 내 뷰티 트렌드를 반영하기 위해 K-뷰티 브랜드 유치에 본격적으로 나설 것이라고 밝히기도 했다.
럭셔리 뷰티 제품 수요 급증
커니(Kerney)의 2024년 9월 리포트에 따르면, 인도 럭셔리 뷰티 시장은 아직 초기 단계에 머물러 있어 구조적 성장 여력이 크다. 전체 뷰티 시장에서 럭셔리 제품이 차지하는 비중은 불과 4%로 태국, 베트남, 말레이시아와 같은 아시아 개발도상국의 20~25% 점유율에 비해서도 현저히 낮은 수준이다.
하지만 최근 인도의 럭셔리 뷰티 부문이 대중적인 뷰티 시장보다 두 배 빠른 속도로 성장하고 있으며, 미래 전망도 밝다.
글로벌 럭셔리 뷰티 브랜드들은 인도를 차세대 성장 동력으로 주목하며 적극적인 시장 공략에 나서고 있다. 이러한 흐름은 이미 수년 전부터 이어져 왔지만, 2025년에는 보다 구체적이고 전략적인 진출 사례들이 잇따라 등장하고 있다.
프랑스 명품 브랜드 샤넬(Chanel)은 2025년 5월 기준 총 7개의 부티크 매장을 운영하고 있으며 인도 내 입지를 강화하기 위해 뷰티 플랫폼 나이카(Nykaa)와 파트너십을 체결했다. 2025년 말까지 인도 전역에 위치한 10개 이상의 오프라인 매장으로 유통망을 확대할 계획이다.
일본 시세이도 그룹의 메이크업 브랜드 나스(NARS)도 2025년 나이카를 통해 인도 온라인 뷰티 시장에 공식 진출했다.
입생로랑(YSL)도 2024년 7월에 나이카를 통해 인도에 첫 진출했으며, 같은 해 11월에는 남인도 내 첫 오프라인 매장을 개점했다.
인도 소매업체 릴라이언스 리테일(Reliance Retail)의 옴니채널 뷰티 전문점 티라(Tira)는 인도 럭셔리 뷰티 시장을 본격적으로 공략해 2024년 11월 뭄바이(Mumbai)에 위치한 최고급 쇼핑몰 지오 월드 플라자(Jio World Plaza)에 플래그십 매장을 오픈했다.
위조 및 유해 화장품 단속 강화
불법 화장품 문제에 대응하기 위해 인도 당국은 2023년부터 '사운다라야(Soundarya) 작전'이라는 이름으로 대규모 단속을 진행해왔다.
이 과정에서 라끄메(Lakme), 로레알(L'Oral), 후다 뷰티(Huda Beauty), 메이블린(Meybelin)을 모방한 위조품이 적발된 적 있다.
인도 정부는 2025년에도 인도 전 지역에서 불법 화장품 유통에 대한 대대적인 수사와 단속을 진행했다.
2025년 1월 인도 서부 최남단 해안에 위치한 케랄라(Kerala)주에서는 70만 루피(한화 약 1,120만 원) 규모의 유해 화장품이 적발됐다. 이번 단속으로 33개 업체가 적발돼 법적 조치가 진행 중이다. 압수된 립스틱과 페이셜 크림 샘플에서는 수은 함유량이 법정 기준치보다 최대 1만 2,000배 높게 검출되는 충격적인 결과가 나타났다.
지난 3월 말에는 인도 국세청 산하 조세 정보국(DRI)이 해외에서 밀반입된 중국발 대규모 위조 화장품 컨테이너를 적발했다. 내용물이 신고 품목과 전혀 다른 가짜 화장품으로 확인됐다.
위인도표준국(BIS)은 2025년 3월 델리에 위치한 글로벌 유통업제조 및 불량 화장품 단속의 일환으로, 2025년 3월에 아마존(Amazon)과 현지 대형 전자상거래 플랫폼 플립카트(Flipkart)의 창고를 급습해 각각 8만 1,561달러(한화 약 1억 1,205만 원)와 7,000달러(한화 약 962만 원) 상당의 품질 기준 미달 상품을 압수했다.
이에 따라 정품 유통망 식별을 위해 전자로고(e-log)를 도입한 샤넬의 디지털 기반 위조 방지 시스템 강화 사례처럼, 뷰티 브랜드들은 각자의 방법으로 대응에 나서고 있다.
로컬 뷰티 브랜드 생태계 확장
인도 화장품 시장은 경쟁력 있는 로컬 브랜드들이 두각을 나타내며 새로운 성장 국면을 맞이하는 모습이다. 실제 소비자들의 수요에 밀착한 제품 개발과 유통채널 다변화를 통해 인도 토종 브랜드들이 화장품 시장의 주도권을 확장하고 있다.
2004년 설립된 컬러바(Colorbar)는 2025년 5월 기준 100개 이상의 직영 매장과 쇼퍼스 스톱(Shoppers Stop), 라이프스타일(Lifestyle) 등의 주요 소매점을 통해 1,200개 이상의 매장에 입점해 있다. 2025년까지 수익을 두 배로 늘려 100억 루피(약 1,400억 원) 이상을 달성할 것으로 전망하며, 2027년 초 기업공개(IPO)를 계획 중이다.
대표적인 인도 뷰티 브랜드 라끄메(Lakm)는 인구 구조와 소비 트렌드 변화에 대응해 '미니스(Minis)'라 불리는 소형 패키지 제품군에 주력하고 있다. 소용량 제품은 합리적인 가격, 휴대 편의성, 저렴한 가격으로 다양한 체험을 할 수 있기 때문에 Z세대 소비자층에서 강한 지지를 얻고 있다.
인도는 전체 인구의 약 65%가 35세 이하로 젊은층의 비중이 압도적인 국가인 만큼, 다양한 제품을 부담없이 시도하고 싶어하는 젊은 소비자층을 타깃으로 삼았다.
인도 메이크업 브랜드 매트룩 코스메틱(Mattlook Cosmetics) 또한 디지털 네이티브 세대를 공략하고 있다.
2025년 2월부터 퀵커머스 플랫폼 스위기 인스타마트(Swiggy Instamart)와의 제휴를 통해 10분 이내에 메이크업 제품을 배송해주는 혁신적인 배송 서비스를 제공하며 옴니채널을 구축했다.
지난 3월, 에스티로더 컴퍼니즈(ELC)는 인도상공업부(Ministry of Commerce and Industry)와 정부 주도 창업 지원 플랫폼 스타트업 인디아(Startup India)와 양해각서(MOU)를 체결했다.
뷰티앤유 인디아(BEAUTY&YOU India) 프로그램을 통해 현지 유망 스타트업을 발굴 및 지원할 예정이다.

가르 솝의 매직 솝은 샤프론, 샌달우드, 코코넛 오일 등 엄선한 자연유래 성분만 담았고, 제조과정은 100% 수작업으로 이뤄진다. 동물실험을 하지 않는 윤리적인 철학으로 소비자의 신뢰를 얻고 있다.

립스틱 인기 1위, 슈가 코스메틱
슈가 코스메틱(SUGAR Cosmetics)은 2015년 비니타 싱(Vineeta Singh)이 설립한 뷰티 브랜드다.
창립자는 뷰티 구독 서비스 '팹 백(Fab Bag)'을 통해 20만 명 이상의 여성들과 소통하며 인도 여성들의 다양한 피부 톤에 맞는 제품이 부족하다는 문제를 발견했고, 이를 바탕으로 22가지 색상의 파운데이션 스틱을 포함한 다양한 메이크업 제품을 개발했다.

20~25% 점유율에 비해서도 현저히 낮은 수준이다. 하지만 최근 인도의 럭셔리 뷰티 부문이 대중적인 뷰티 시장보다 두 배 빠른 속도로 성장하고 있으며, 미래 전망도 밝다. 글로벌 럭셔리 뷰티 브랜드들은 인도를 차세대 성장 동력으로 주목하며 적극적인 시장 공략에 나서고 있다. 이러한 흐름은 이미 수년 전부터 이어져 왔지만, 2025년에는 보다 구체적이고

세대를 공략하고 있다. 2025년 2월부터 퀵커머스 플랫폼 스위기 인스타마트(Swiggy Instamart)와의 제휴를 통해 10분 이내에 메이크업 제품을 배송해주는 혁신적인 배송 서비스를 제공하며 옴니채널을 구축했다. 지난 3월, 에스티로더 컴퍼니즈(ELC)는 인도상공업부(Ministry of Commerce and Industry)와 정부 주도 창업 지원 플랫폼 스타트업 인디아(Startup India)와 양해각서(MOU)를 체결했다. 뷰티앤유 인디아(BEAUTY&YOU India) 프로그램을 통해 현지 유망 스타트업을 발굴 및 지원할 예정이다. 인기 스킨케어 제품 분석 2025년 2월 3주차부터 5월 1주차까지 인도 아마존의 스킨케어 상위 10개 인기 제품을 분석한 결과, 클렌징 제품과 선케어 제품의 강세가 두드러졌다. 특히, 선케어 제품의 경우, 2월 3주차에는 3개, 5월 1주차에는 4개가 순위권에 올라 자외선 차단에 대한 인도 소비자들의 지속적인 관심을 확인할 수 있다. 5월 1주차에는 청량감과 쿨링 효과를 강조한 여름철 특화 선케어 제품이 새롭게 순위에 등장하면서, 계절 변화에 민감하게 반응하는 소비 트렌드를 보여줬다. 국가별 브랜드 분포를 살펴보면, 2025년 2월 3주차와 5월 1주차 Top 10 중 각각 7개, 6개를 인도 브랜드가 차지해 자국 브랜드에 대한 인도 소비자들의 신뢰가 돋보인다. 또한, 스위스 브랜드 세타필, 영국 브랜드 심플과 데톨이 6주 간의 분석 기간 내내 10위권을 유지해 특정 글로벌 브랜드에 대한 인도 소비자들의 선호도가 꾸준함을 입증했다. 비누 1위, 가르 솝 매직 솝 가르 솝(Ghar Soap)은 2019년 의붓형제인 라지브 쿠마르(Rajeev Kumar)와 로힛 쿠마르(Rohit Kumar)가 인도에서 창업한 스킨케어 브랜드다. 천연 비누에 담긴 철학과 비전을 진정성있게 전닿하며 대중의 마음을 사로잡았고, 그 후 브랜드 인지도와 매출이 가파르게 상승하며 인도에서 클린뷰티를 대표하는 스킨케어 브랜드로 자리잡았다. 가르 솝의 매직 솝은 샤프론, 샌달우드, 코코넛 오일 등 엄선한 자연유래 성분만 담았고, 제조과정은 100% 수작업으로 이뤄진다. 동물실험을 하지 않는 윤리적인 철학으로 소비자의 신뢰를 얻고 있다. 인도 소비자들의 후기를 분석한 결과, 대부분 일주일 이내에 피부 톤 개선을 체험했다는 평이 많았다. 인기 메이크업 제품 분석 2025년 2월 3주차부터 5월 1주차까지 인도 아마존의 메이크업 상위 10개 인기 제품을 분석한 결과, 립 메이크업과 아이라이너가 강세를 보였다. 특히, 메이블린의 아이라이너와 매트 립 시리즈는 6주 간의 분석 기간 내내 상위권을 유지해 지속력이 좋고 매트한 마무리감을 가진 제품들에 대한 소비자 선호도가 높음을 입증했다. 또한, 2월 3주차에는 파운데이션과 스트롭 크림이 순위에 포함된 반면, 5월 1주차에는 파우더 제품의 순위가 상승하는 등 계절에 따른 베이스 메이크업 제품에 대한 소비자 선호도 변화가 나타났다. 국가별 브랜드 분포를 살펴보면, 미국과 인도 브랜드가 균형을 이루고 있다. 미국 브랜드 메이블린이 단독으로 주차별 순위의 과반을 차지하는 압도적인 점유율을 보였다. 반면, 인도 브랜드로는 슈가 코스메틱, 르네, 라끄메, 스위스 뷰티 등 다양한 브랜드가 고르게 분포됐다. 특히, 슈가 코스메틱의 매트 립스틱은 집계 기간 내 세 차례 1위를 차지하는 등 높은 인기를 보여줬다. 립스틱 인기 1위, 슈가 코스메틱 슈가 코스메틱(SUGAR Cosmetics)은 2015년 비니타 싱(Vineeta Singh)이 설립한 뷰티 브랜드다. 창립자는 뷰티 구독 서비스 '팹 백(Fab Bag)'을 통해 20만 명 이상의 여성들과 소통하며 인도 여성들의 다양한 피부 톤에 맞는 제품이 부족하다는 문제를 발견했고, 이를 바탕으로 22가지 색상의 파운데이션 스틱을 포함한 다양한 메이크업 제품을 개발했다. 전 직원의 75%를 여성으로 구성하는 등 다양성과 포용의 가치를 실천하고 있으며, 여성의 자립과 사회 참여를 독려하는 다채로운 활동으로 브랜드 철학을 다져왔다. 슈가 코스메틱의 매트 애즈 헬 크래용 립스틱은 레드, 누드, 핑크, 퍼플 등 총 30가지 이상의 다채로운 색상으로 출시됐다. 인기 헤어케어 제품 분석 2025년 2월 3주차부터 5월 1주차까지 인도 아마존의 헤어케어 상위 10개 인기 제품을 분석한 결과, 헤어 세럼, 샴푸, 염모제 등 다양한 제품군이 고르게 포함됐다. 특히, 모발에 영양을 공급하고 수분을 유지해주는 기능성 제품들의 강세가 두드러졌다. 그 외에도 모발 성장과 비듬 개선 효과를 강조하는 제품들이 꾸준히 순위에 들어가 두피 건강 중심의 헤어케어가 주요 트렌드로 자리잡았다. 국가별 브랜드 분포를 살펴보면, 프랑스 브랜드 로레알이 2025년 2월 3주차에 5개, 5월 1주차에 6개 제품을 상위 10위에 올려 인도 헤어케어 시장에서 압도적인 영향력을 보여줬다. 헤어 세럼 인기 제품, 위시케어 위시케어(WishCare)는 2019년에 인도에서 출범한 뷰티 스타트업이다. 위시케어는 제품 출시 전부터 인도 소비자들로부터 피드백을 적극 수집 및 분석해 수요를 파악하고, 이를 제품 성분, 효능, 사용감을 개선하는데 활용해 브랜드 신뢰도를 높이고 있다. 3개월 이상 제품을 사용한 소비자들의 후기를 분석한 결과, 눈에 띄게 탈모가 줄고 새로운 모발이 자라기 시작했다는 경험담이 다수 확인됐다. 두피 가려움증 완화와 모발 굵기 개선에 대한 만족도가 높았다.",2025-07-09 09:49:15,ko,WEB,,,,e0960058a619f4af08f403016aae70b2,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This is a

17868406239331253,"  #sheglam #sheglamglacierglosmoothingprimer #faceprimer #sheglamfam I bought the sheglam ""glacier glo"" smoothing primer off Amazon. It is $8.99. The primer comes with a little spatula. It claims to hydrate & smooth pores & control oil. The texture of this primer reminds me of the huda beauty ""blur jam"" & the touchinsol ""icy sherbet"" primers. I have both. Both of those are silicone primers & are thick to apply. I assumed this one would be the same,  but surprisingly it melted right into my skin & is lightweight. I was honestly shocked by this primer. It was not what I expected when I applied it. It did give me some hydration. It's not a crazy amount of hydration,  but definitely some. It does give you a smooth base. I can't speak to the oil control bc I am not oily. I lean more dry. I honestly think this is a great affordable primer. It's fun to play with too. If you're in the market for a new primer, I'd give this one a try #makeup #makeupjunkie #makeuplover #makeupaddict #makeupartist #mua #selftaughtmua #undiscoveredmuas #bblogger #beautyblogger #makeupblogger #beauty #cosmetics #microinfluencer #makeupinfluencer #newmakeup #makeupnews ##review #reviewer #makeupreview #makeupreviewer #beautyreview","I bought the sheglam ""glacier glo"" smoothing primer off Amazon.
