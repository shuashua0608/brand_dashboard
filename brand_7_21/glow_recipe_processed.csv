Anyway, here's a lime recipe perfect for summer. I have no idea if it glows. **Ingredients:** ‚Ä¢ 12 ounces milk (1%) ‚Ä¢ 2 scoops vanilla protein powder (60g). I use [Metabolic Drive](https://go.biotest.net/MDatAmazon). ‚Ä¢ 1.5 teaspoons lime gelatin, sugar-free ‚Ä¢ 2 tablespoons key lime juice (or regular lime) **Directions:** 1. Whisk everything together and freeze. 2. Spin on the Lite setting. 3. For a soft-serve texture, re-spin with a tablespoon of extra milk. Pics show both options. **Notes:** 1. For a variation, mix in coconut flakes. 2. Works great in push-up pop molds, often sold as ""cake pop"" molds on Amazon. See my orange push-pop recipe [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ninjacreami/comments/1luq8kr/orange_pushup_pop_16_oz_high_protein/). 3. I tried several variations, and this is my favorite, but play around by using half a teaspoon more or less of the lime gelatin. 4. I found bottled key lime juice at Walmart. Handy. Pic in comments. 5. Key lime is sharper, tangier, and more intense than standard lime, but also slightly sweeter. Both work in this recipe. 6. If your gelatin sticks to the sides during freezing, run a butter knife or pastry spatula down the side after the first spin, then re-spin or remix."

mov_A2A94AC2A434396E1B3BCF285FD202B7,2025-07-15 16:32:56,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Starbucks has turned years of customer hacks and social‚Äëmedia lore into a permanent feature: a branded Secret Menu that now lives in the Starbucks app. The rollout went live on July 14, giving the chain's 32 million U.S. Rewards members one‚Äëtap access to pre‚Äëcustomized drinks and a shot at a cash prize for inventing the next viral beverage. One‚ÄëTap Ordering for Cult‚ÄëFavorite Hacks Locating the Secret Menu is simple: open the app, head to the ‚ÄúOffers‚Äù tab, and tap a drink. All ingredient tweaks, e.g., extra pumps, foam swaps, and toppings, auto-populate in the cart, sparing baristas (and customers) a recital of modifications at the counter. Starbucks says the move streamlines throughput while letting fans ‚Äúorder exactly what they see on Instagram without memorizing a recipe.‚Äù The Opening Lineup: Four Social‚ÄëMedia Stars To mark launch day, Starbucks highlighted four custom beverages drawn from fan requests and its own ‚ÄúNot‚ÄëSo‚ÄëSecret Menu‚Äù Instagram broadcast channel: Cookies on Top ‚Äì Cold Brew, vanilla syrup, Vanilla Sweet Cream Cold Foam, cookie‚Äëcrumble topping. Dragonfruit Glow‚ÄëUp ‚Äì Mango Dragonfruit Lemonade Refresher blended with peach juice, finished with Sweet Cream Cold Foam. Lemon, Tea & Pearls ‚Äì Black tea lemonade plus raspberry popping pearls. Just Add White Mocha ‚Äì Brown Sugar Oatmilk Shaken Espresso upgraded with white‚Äëchocolate mocha sauce and Sweet Cream Cold Foam. The company promises fresh rotations ‚Äúregularly,‚Äù so the list is expected to evolve as trends bubble up. A $25,000 Contest to Crowd‚ÄëSource the Next Hit Innovation isn't limited to corporate R&D. From July 14 to 20, customers and employees can submit their own drink recipes at Starbucks' contest site. Judges will narrow down entries to four finalists, whose drinks will appear on the Secret Menu from August 18 to 25 and earn each creator $5,000. Instagram voting during that window will crown one grand‚Äëprize winner, worth an extra $25,000. Why Starbucks Is Doing This The Secret Menu aligns with two priorities outlined in CEO Laxman Narasimhan's ‚ÄúBack to Starbucks‚Äù strategy: simplifying the core menu to expedite service and then utilizing digital channels to introduce limited-time innovations. By embedding fan inventions directly in the app, Starbucks captures social buzz and directs it to its highest‚Äëmargin ordering channel. What It Means for Customers and Baristas For customers, the appeal is obvious: no more guesswork or gray‚Äëarea modifications at the register. For baristas, recipes are standardized and appear on the ticket, reducing errors. The company also avoids stocking new ingredients; every Secret Menu drink relies on SKUs already behind the bar. Starbucks says this ‚Äúbalance of creativity and operational sanity‚Äù is key to keeping wait times down."

mov_5A68035497E0447CCB302A815C6E4992,2025-07-16 03:38:02,en,WEB,"‚Äâ The future fairy queen of Celestia bakes lavender tarts in an opening scene and that special recipe is included in the back of the book ""The Amulet of Undoing"" by Kasey Safford. The same lavender tarts her grandmother makes will be served at the book signing on Sunday, July 20 at 4 to 6 p.m. at Understory Book Shop, 111 Railroad Ave., Cashmere. The floral dessert becomes even sweeter as the center of a conflict between Princess Luna of Celestia and a earthy sprite from Durand, who she will later need for help on a quest to save the two kingdoms. In an enemies to lovers trope, they first meet at a coronation ball, where Luna lurks in her mother's shadow as the fairy folk's beloved ruler despite her trained upbringing. Not until her limits are put to the test in the Bog with three companions saving the world does she rise to the occasion to fill the queen's huge shoes. Self-acceptance is a key theme Safford worked into the book, she said, also that people who are different can unite for something important to the common good. Kasey Safford.jpg Kasey Safford ""You see her face all these different challenges and come to a moment where she realizes 'I did all of this. Why can't I do that too?'"" Safford said of Luna, a character who she made up of some of her toughest tendencies. The supporting character Rhea reflects the author's fun side, her witty banter and charisma, which some friends noticed after reading the self-published book. As backstory, Rhea snuck into the palace to steal food as an orphan and bonded with the princess in close friendship. Another sprite on the quest is Atlas, a nerdy fellow with a big heart, the only one in the group smart enough to read the journal in a foreign language for clues to find three items. Those important, illusive items can be traded to an undead monster for the spell to undo an evil curse. The book's dedication goes out to Safford's father, who once offered her a check to stop reading fantasy books, which she refused for any amount. ""Sorry father, but I'm not just reading them anymore. This is priceless,"" it says. After first trying to write a fiction book in high school for NaNoWriMo, Safford found the idea for a young adult romantasy novel ""The Amulet of Undoing"" while in college at Arizona State University. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in English in 2023, as well as gaining an online certificate in Digital Humanities from Harvard University. Safford's obsession with fairies began as a child when her mother left a shimmery pop-up book about fairies under her pillow instead of money for a lost tooth. She'd make tiny furniture to leave in gardens for the fae, and believed (believes) in fairy circles. Book Cover.jpg ""The Amulet of Undoing"" by Kasey Safford. After a year of writing and a year of editing, Safford queried some agents for publication but ultimately self-published and said, ""It started driving me crazy keeping it to myself, I was like 'I'm just dying to share this with everyone because it's my proudest creative accomplishment.'"" Writing the novel was not a lonely experience for her, Safford said, since she had so much support, especially from her best friend, Tori Morgan, a second grade teacher at Cascade Christian Academy who read the book weekly as it was being written to make critiques and give compliments. Practicing fight choreography moves for accuracy and quoting Casper's sassy lines back to his wife, Caiden Safford, owner of Caiden's Carpet Cleaning, is also a major supporter. He easily understands when she wakes at 2 a.m. to bolt up to type in her phone with an idea for the next book she's writing, a holiday romance which is halfway done. It's about six friends working at Sea-Tac Airport who all find love the week of Christmas in all different romance tropes of enemies to lovers, friends to lovers, fake romance to real romance, forbidden love and more. In Celestia, fairies don't blush, their cheeks shimmer, and when they're kissed, their wings glow. They dance the gaiety at every ball and believe that the more special an occasion is the sweeter the food should be, especially the lavender tarts. Copyright (C) 2025, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

DCB408E56108BB666B94FDF30CE770DF,2025-07-16 07:23:54,en,PRINT,"‚Äâ You asked, we answered: Here's everything you'll want to know about making great meals in the great outdoors. Some dinners are just better eaten outside. Cooked over a crackling fire, surrounded by pitch pines, lightning bugs and scurrying squirrels, even something simple like a skillet of nachos can go from good to remarkable. The smoke of a wood fire swirls into the beans. The cheese sizzles crisp. Some chips toast to an admirable char. Campfire cooking can seem complicated, what with the planning, packing and schlepping involved in fashioning a temporary kitchen in the great outdoors. But keep the meal ideas, tools and setup simple and campfire cooking might just be more enjoyable than cooking at home. My partner and I have twice circled the United States in our camper van, but we knew very little when we set out. We learned as we went. There were many nights of cooking out in the wind and rain and jet-black sky, a lot of ramen. Not every night was dreamy, but every morning we were glad to wake up where we were. There's nothing quite like cooking over live fire -- and no two times are ever the same -- but with this basic intel, you might just do it again and again. The questions below were submitted by readers and Food staff alike. If you're camp cooking-curious and don't know where to start, you're in the right place. For more good eating, see this collection of camping recipes. How do I build a campfire? Humans have been cooking food over fire for at least 780,000 years, so there are many ways to effectively start one. I typically prepare dinner while my partner gets the fire going (Camping Lesson 1: Divide and conquer), but he taught me a method that even newbies like me can pull off -- on camera! (Watch above.) Some Safety Notes Always be sure to follow local rules and regulations. Some campsites will have pits with grates for you; others may have a fire ban (in which case, it's sandwiches for dinner). Use wood that was bought or acquired locally to avoid transporting invasive species. Keep a bucket of water near for emergencies -- and to put out the fire before going to bed. Be sure to stir the water with the embers so they're all drenched. What kind of equipment is especially helpful? The tools you'll use to cook over a campfire aren't that different from what you use at home, save for long tongs and a dish bin, so bring a curated selection of what you already have in your kitchen. When we were packing, whatever tool I used when cooking over the course of a week went into a box for the van. If I'd used it at home, chances were I'd want it camping, too. You probably need only one skillet; I use a large, carbon-steel skillet for most things. And certain tools have multiple uses. For instance, a sheet pan can be a table to put tools on, a tray for prepped ingredients, a platter for finished food, a lid for your skillet, a fan to get the fire roaring. (During one winter in Montana, I even used it as a sled.) How do I keep my food from burning right up? It can be tempting to cook directly over big, glowing, roaring flames, but they'll end up charring your food completely. Instead, wait for the flames to die down a bit: A fire is ready to cook on when the logs have broken down into coals that glow orange and are covered with a layer of gray ash. That's your cue to arrange a grill grate over the coals and let it heat, then add your food, preferably in a skillet, which can be a safer bet than cooking over the grates at the campsite. If you do find your food consumed by flames, move it to a cooler part of the fire. Look for areas where the coals aren't as red or bright, or hold your hand a few inches above different parts of the coals to feel their temperature. Avoid spraying the flames with water, which will spray the ash onto your food. Essential Tips for Camp Cooking Go easy on yourself when building a campfire, and feel free to use supermarket fire starters. A carbon-steel skillet can be much easier to use (and lighter to pack!) than a cast-iron skillet. Tongs can do double-duty, moving food and wood around. Kitchen shears are your friend: Cut ingredients like kimchi right in the jar, or scallions right over your bowl to avoid cleaning a messy cutting board. Choose meals that don't require a lot of measurements: Eyeballing ingredients means less dishwashing. How do I build a meal in a foil packet? When you're camping, a foil packet -- aluminum foil envelopes of ingredients -- can be especially helpful...."

Please look at the last photo so you could see the sunburn on my chest. I have no idea why I have all these dark patches in my face just looks absolutely dirty and it's not I'm gonna go home and take off my make up and post another picture. It started about three months ago, where I had that patch of hyper pigmentation on my forehead. I feel that things have been getting darker. This is my skin care regimen.
