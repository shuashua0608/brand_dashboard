B31196853518497590978B9CEF70CBB6,2025-07-14 06:31:21,en,PRINT,"  MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage (I charge from £1,150 for mine). Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 (£19.55, www.amazon.co.uk), Olaplex No.8 (£22.40, www.sephora.co.uk) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer (£21, www.boots.com). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner (£27, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner (£26, www.harrods.com). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now £17.99, sha op.toni www.ndguy.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now £12, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo (£24.50, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment (£25). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist...."

mov_2E46CFEB3B519CDA92E98402581AEA5C,2025-07-14 12:30:10,ro,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[ro]Levi Strauss a anunţat că va reduce numărul modelelor mai puţin populare disponibile în perioada sărbătorilor, ca strategie de protejare împotriva tarifelor impuse de SUA. Producătorul de jeans îşi propune astfel să evite reducerile de preţ necesare pentru a lichida stocurile greu vandabile, relatează Reuters. Joi, compania a ridicat estimările privind veniturile şi profitul anual, mizând pe cererea crescută pentru colecţii noi care includ rochii, fuste şi jeanşi cu croială largă, în ciuda faptului că mulţi cumpărători americani devin mai prudenţi în faţa creşterii generale a preţurilor. ”Analizăm strict productivitatea ofertelor noastre”, a declarat Harmit Singh, directorul financiar Levi Strauss, pentru Reuters. El a explicat că se elimină din portofoliu culorile şi modelele care nu se vând, pentru a face loc produselor noi. ”Reducem astfel şi discounturile”, a spus Singh. Alte companii americane, precum producătorul de jucării Hasbro, au adoptat tactici similare, tăind liniile de produse mai puţin performante, o strategie folosită şi în timpul pandemiei, de exemplu de Nike. Levi Strauss a implementat o strategie de ”asortiment comun”, producând articole identice sau similare în mai multe pieţe, pentru a avea flexibilitatea de a redistribui rapid stocurile la nivel global. Tarifele vamale impuse de administraţia Trump ţărilor precum China, Cambodgia, Vietnam şi Bangladesh au determinat companiile să-şi regândească lanţurile de aprovizionare. Costurile suplimentare pentru vămuirea unui container de jeans pot atinge zeci de mii de dolari, ceea ce va creşte preţurile de vânzare cu amănuntul, mai ales în perioada critică a cumpărăturilor de sărbători. Marja operaţională a Levi Strauss a crescut la 7,5% în ultimul trimestru, faţă de 1,5% în aceeaşi perioadă a anului trecut. Analiştii au salutat decizia companiei de a reduce drastic numărul codurilor de produs (SKU), o măsură considerată eficientă şi sustenabilă. ”Decizia Levi de a reduce SKU-urile neproductive este una inteligentă şi sustenabilă”, a comentat Angeli Gianchandani, lector la NYU. ”Nike a aplicat o strategie similară – 'mai puţine, mai mari, mai curajoase' – iar branduri precum Coach şi Uniqlo au avut succes concentrându-se pe produsele-vedetă.” Şi Hasbro a anunţat în aprilie o reducere semnificativă a SKU-urilor şi o scădere a importurilor din China, favorizând în schimb produse fabricate în India, considerate mai stabile. Inclusiv comercianţii mai mici, care vând prin Amazon, şi-au redus oferta pentru a compensa impactul tarifelor şi al comisioanelor. Mulţi dintre ei preferă să participe la evenimente de discounturi precum Black Friday şi Cyber Monday. Firma de consultanţă Front Row, specializată în marketing e-commerce pentru branduri de frumuseţe precum Tatcha (Unilever) şi Ouai (Procter & Gamble), a menţionat că mai mulţi clienţi au redus numărul produselor oferite în cadrul Prime Day, care s-a desfăşurat pe parcursul a 98 de ore. Potrivit Adobe Analytics, retailerii americani au înregistrat vânzări de 7,9 miliarde de dolari doar în prima zi a evenimentului Prime Day, marcând cel mai mare volum de cumpărături online din acest an. ”Tot mai multe branduri se gândesc să reducă din SKU-uri. Încearcă să optimizeze acel 20% din portofoliu care generează 80% din vânzări”, a spus Alexandra Carmody, vicepreşedinte comercial la Front Row. Chiar şi Bogg Bag, companie care vinde genţi de plajă din plastic la 80 de dolari în magazinele Dick's Sporting Goods şi pe Amazon, a redus numărul articolelor disponibile pentru sezonul de iarnă, pentru a se concentra exclusiv pe cele mai bine vândute produse, a declarat CEO-ul Kim Vaccarella."

Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen.

Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 ((EURO)29.50, www.brownthomas.com), Olaplex No.8 ((EURO)29.50, www.arnotts.ie) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer ((EURO)24.45, www.lookfantastic.ie). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair.

THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now (EURO)22.49, www.cloud10beauty.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now (EURO)14, www.sephora.co.uk). 5.

I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo ((EURO)28.20, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment ((EURO)28). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky!

I find these hold my hair well and doesn't make it greasy. OUAI wave spray - after towel drying my hair, I spray this in at the root and use my hands to get it all through my hair. Then blow dry my hair with a brush at first. I try to brush it up and back to get some volume. Then I use my hands to get it in the shape I want. I like the smell of this but it's not really a masculine scent haha. My wife told she can't smell it on me, if that helps. BLUMAAN Matte Cream Clay - I rub a dime sized amount between my palms and work it into my hair, starting on the back of my head so I don't get too much product gunked on the front. Work it all into my hair and then use my hands to style it. Not much scent on this. I just started this a month ago and have received 4 compliments so far lol. And it's easy to keep track because I don't think I've ever received a compliment on my hair before. I'm also on oral fin and min but that's another story."
