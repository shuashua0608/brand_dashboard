Opfer jagen. Menschen töten. Die Teenager Simon und Mark können sich keinen größeren Horror vorstellen, als aus der Metropole Berlin in die Einöde Brandenburgs zu ziehen. Das Einzige, worauf sie sich freuen, sind sechs Wochen Sommerferien, doch auch hier macht ihnen ihr Vater einen Strich durch die Rechnung. Er nimmt sie mit auf einen Ausflug zu einer ganz besonderen Schule. Gelegen mitten im Wald auf einer einsamen Insel. Mit einem grausamen Lehrplan, nach dem sonst nur in der Hölle unterrichtet wird ...          Die Geschichte beginnt mit einem Auszug aus einem Patiententagebuch: Simon Zambrowski schreibt – auf Anraten seines „Seelenklempners“ – in einer geschlossenen psychiatrischen Anstalt ein Erinnerungstagebuch. Er beginnt mit seiner Rückschau am 2. Juli 1993. Nachdem die Holz- und Bautenschutzfirma seines Vaters, Vitus Zambrowski, unverschuldet in die Pleite geraten ist, zieht die Familie von Berlin ins brandenburgische Wendisch Rietz im Landkreis Oder-Spree. Dort steht seit Jahren das ehemalige Elternhaus von Vitus leer – ein Erbe, das ihm nach der Wende zurückübertragen wurde. In den letzten vier Wochen hat er das marode Gebäude zumindest so weit aufgehübscht und renoviert, dass es wieder bewohnbar ist. Es befindet sich zwar noch immer in einem katastrophalen Zustand, aber daran lässt sich ja arbeiten – vor allem, wenn man erst einmal darin lebt. In Wendisch Rietz lernen Simon, damals 13, und sein Bruder Mark, 12, schon kurz nach dem Einzug ihren Nachbarn Stotter-Peter kennen – lt. Polizei handelt es sich um einen verurteilten pädophilen Straftäter, seinen Hund Gismo sowie Sandy und ihre Clique. Diese Begegnungen sind der Auslöser für das, was Simon und Mark in den Sommerferien auf einer Insel mitten im Storkower See erleben (müssen). Es ist nicht schön. Und es ist blutig …         Ich habe dieses Buch schon seit Ewigkeiten in meinem Regal stehen und da ich kein großer Fitzek-Fan bin, ging ich davon aus, dass es auch noch weitere Ewigkeiten dort stehenbleiben würde. Von mehreren Seiten habe ich dann jedoch gehört/gelesen, dass es sich hier nicht um einen typischen Fitzek handeln würde - also habe ich es im Rahmen meiner SuB-Abbau-Challenge [Buchlotto 2025] Überraschung aus dem SuB im März 2025 zur Hand genommen. Zur Vorgeschichte, warum Sebastian Fitzek ein Buch unter dem Pseudonym Max Rhode schreibt, habe ich folgende Informationen gefunden - da ich, wie gesagt, kein Fitzek-Fan bin, war mir diese Information nicht geläufig. :-) Max Rhode ist der Hauptcharakter seines Buches ""Das Joshua Profil"", Rhode ist ein erfolgloser Schriftsteller und sein Werk ist ""Die Blutschule"". Da lag es für Fitzek nahe, dieses Buch im Namen seines Protagonisten zu schreiben und zu veröffentlichen. Die Handlung des Buches ist nicht offiziell in zwei unterschiedliche Handlungsstränge unterteilt, aber die Geschichte ändert sich genau an dem Punkt, an dem Vitus nach einem Badeunfall jemanden wiederbeleben muss und bei der Mund-zu-Mund-Beatmung ""der Kontakt"" auf ihn überspringt. Von dem Zeitpunkt an ist Vitus vom Bösen besessen - und seine Söhne werden es in naher Zukunft am eigenen Leib erfahren. ""Der Kontakt"" ist eine Wesensveränderung, die aus einem Blick in einen Spiegel resultiert. Der Spiegel wurde zwischenzeitlich zerstört, es gibt aber Lebewesen, in denen der Kontakt seit Jahren innewohnt. ""Lass es mich so formulieren: Alles, was an dir gut und liebenswert war, verkehrt sich in sein Gegenteil. Und alles schlechte wird gut. Aus negativ wird positiv und umgekehrt. Äußerlich bleibst Du ganz der Alte, doch innerlich ist Deine Seele komplett umgekrempelt"". (Seite 59/60)      „Der Kontakt“ bringt außerdem eine wesentliche Veränderung mit sich: Er macht das befallene Lebewesen unsterblich...     Diesen Teil der Handlung muss ich leider spoilern, denn nur so ergibt meine Aussage Sinn: Für mich hatte dieser Teil der Geschichte etwas von Stephen Kings Friedhof der Kuscheltiere. Das Buch ist mit 257 Seiten nicht sehr umfangreich, weswegen ich eine rasante Handlung erwartet hatte. Stattdessen plätschert die Handlung auf den ersten 129 Seiten eigentlich nur so vor sich hin. Nachdem Vitus sich im Wesen verändert hat, kommt langsam etwas Fahrt in die Geschichte und ab Seite 130 befinden sich Vitus, Simon und Mark nun endlich auf der Insel im Storkower See. Sie ist zwar unbewohnt, es findet sich jedoch eine alte Holzhütte im Dickicht, die für die beiden Brüder von nun ab zum Klassenzimmer werden wird. Vitus bezeichnet es als den wichtigsten Ort ihres jungen Lebens. Denn dort werden sie nun lernen, was ihnen die normale Schule nicht beigebracht hat: Töten. Aber bevor man töten kann, braucht man zunächst ein Opfer. Deshalb erhalten Simon und Mark täglich Lektionen im Fährtenlesen, Fallenstellen, Jagen, Einfangen – und schließlich Töten. Für jede dieser Lektionen steht ihnen eine bestimmte Zeitspanne zur Verfügung. Gelingt ihnen die Aufgabe nicht innerhalb dieser Frist, werden sie hart und unnachgiebig bestraft. Im zweiten Teil des Buches geht es nun endlich stramm weiter, denn das rasante Vorgehen von Vitus lässt dem Leser nur wenig Zeit, sich von den Grausamkeiten zu erholen. Vielleicht ist das ganz gut so, denn bei geringerer Geschwindigkeit hätte mein Hirn sich wahrscheinlich geweigert all die Grausamkeiten zu lesen, die von Simon und Mark begangen werden müssen, denn ihr Vater kennt keine Erbarmen, sollten sie versagen. Für einen Thriller ist mir dieser Part deutlich zu brutal, ich würde es eher im Genre Horror einordnen - und hätte ich das gewusst, hätte ich das Buch ungelesen in eine öffentliche Bücherzelle gestellt. Mein Fazit:  Die ersten 130 Seiten ziehen sich extrem in die Länge. Es passiert zwar etwas, aber es ist nicht herausragend spannend und die Protagonisten sind mir auch nicht sympathisch, was sich auch im Verlauf der Geschichte nicht ändert. Die restlichen 127 Seiten sind gefüllt mit den grausamsten Grausamkeiten, so dass ich für mich das Fazit gezogen habe: Ich hätte nichts verpasst, hätte ich das Buch nicht gelesen. Ein Buch mit verstörender Härte, schwachen Charakteren und einer Story, die mich weder fesseln noch überzeugen konnte – und das mir endgültig klar gemacht hat: Fitzek ist einfach nichts für mich."
mov_32F08FD55A571CB94CA4F952CC6CF0F7,2025-07-14 09:35:00,en,WEB,"  Demonstrators outside the U.S. Supreme Court as justices heard arguments in a case about abortion medication in March 2024. This year, lawmakers in at least eight states tried and failed to restrict access by classifying the drugs as controlled substances, and abortion opponents are still pushing for more federal restrictions. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/) Though many legislative sessions have concluded for the year, states could soon see more changes to reproductive health care access with new federal legislation that might lead to clinic closures, as well as pending health policies on abortion pills. Reduced access to abortion and reproductive health care are expected following the reconciliation budget bill President Donald Trump signed on July 4. It strips Medicaid funds from certain reproductive health care providers that also offer legal abortions, especially affecting Planned Parenthood. The largest nonprofit network of reproductive health clinics says an estimated 1 million Medicaid patients would likely lose access to services like birth control, cancer screenings and STI testing, and that it could end up closing 200 of its 600 clinics around the country, primarily in rural areas and in states where abortion is legal. Planned Parenthood sued the Trump administration, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the provision. Though the administration on Friday argued the temporary restraining order should not have been allowed and asked the judge to reverse course. Federal changes to medication abortion rules could also be coming soon, depending on how multiple lawsuits play out. This week one of those lawsuits, Washington v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, ended in a loss in federal district court for the mostly Democratic-led states that sued to eliminate prescriber certification requirements they argue are burdensome. Just halfway through its first year in power, the Trump administration has already fulfilled many  requests from national anti-abortion groups. These groups are urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to add new requirements for medication abortion after Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he would review abortion opponents' claims, based on unpublished papers, that abortion-inducing drugs are unsafe. With federal policy changes poised to reshape the reproductive health care access landscape once again, it's a good time to get the lay of the land by taking a look at recent legislation that made its way into state code. In the first half of 2025, states with abortion bans considered making their bans even stricter. Many focused on limiting access to abortion pills, which dominates as the most widely available form of pregnancy termination. The vast majority of these new measures died in committee. But Louisiana passed a new law to further crack down on medication abortion access that's about to take effect in the coming weeks. Other abortion ban states clarified health exceptions and codified a right to birth control, while those with abortion access are working to pass privacy protections for providers and consumers. Attempts to restrict abortion pills Despite bans in nearly half the states, abortion rates are rising, according to organizations tracking the numbers, such as the Society of Family Planning, which found that 1 in 10 abortions were provided by online-only clinics in the first year after Roe v. Wade was overturned. This was largely made possible by federal policy that allows telehealth abortion care and for pharmacies to dispense the drugs directly to patients. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, 18 states and the District of Columbia have laws shielding doctors who provide abortion care to patients from states where abortion is not legal. But according to UCLA Center for Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy, only California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington protect providers regardless of patient location. Meanwhile, officials in ban states have been working on legislation to try to prevent the mailing or distribution of the abortion drugs into their states, with Louisiana paving the way. This year Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law House Bill 575, or the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act,” which goes into effect Aug. 1 and allows families to sue over suspected abortions. It expands liability to include a pregnant person's parents, the person who impregnated her, and anyone who causes or “substantially facilitates” an abortion. The new law also allows a judge to award at least $100,000 in damages if the defendant is not licensed to practice medicine or dispense medication in Louisiana. Attorney General Liz Murrill, who is prosecuting at least two cases involving New York-based Dr. Margaret Carpenter, said this law is “another tool in the toolbox” to use against out-of-state doctors who prescribe abortion medication to Louisianans via telemedicine. Last year, Louisiana became the first state to reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled dangerous substances, with Act 246, which is being challenged in court. Both drugs are also used to manage miscarriages and postpartum hemorrhage, as well as other conditions. The Louisiana Illuminator reported that some hospitals have started locking up these medications, making them more difficult for doctors to access for timely procedures. This year several states considered but failed to pass similar bills to reclassify abortion drugs as controlled substances, including Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. In a special session in Texas — which is also suing Carpenter for allegedly prescribing medication abortion to a state resident — lawmakers are considering a bill that, like Louisiana's, would give the state new tools for cracking down on telehealth abortion. Senate Bill 2880 would allow anyone who manufactured, distributed, prescribed or provided abortion pills to be sued for $100,000; expand the wrongful death statute; and empower the attorney general to sue on behalf of  “unborn children of residents of this state.” Last session, the measure passed the state Senate but stalled in the House, Several other legislatures saw unsuccessful bills that would have banned the delivery and distribution of abortion-inducing drugs, including Arkansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia. A bill that would have required in-person visits for medication abortion failed in Nebraska. Clarifying abortion bans In a year when the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era policy protecting the right to a medically necessary abortion in an emergency room and stories about health care denials continue to emerge, at least one state clarified the health exceptions in its law. Last month, Texas passed SB 31, titled the “Life of the Mother Act,” which allows abortion if the pregnant woman has a “life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.” The law notes that “a life-threatening physical condition is not necessarily one actively injuring the patient.” Proposed bans in states where voters approved abortion-rights amendments Lawmakers in Michigan and Ohio, where sessions are ongoing, have introduced total abortion bans to challenge voter-approved state constitutional amendments to protect reproductive rights. In Michigan, recently introduced House Bills 4670 and 4671 would create the “justice for babies in the womb act.” The bills, which are unlikely to pass, seek to extend legal personhood..."

(AP) — Multiple people have died in a fire at an assisted living facility in Massachusetts, where people were hanging out of windows screaming for help, authorities said Monday. Firefighters responded to the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River at about 9:50 p.m. Sunday and were met with heavy smoke and flames at the front of the building, with occupants trapped inside, the state Department of Fire Services said in a news release. About 70 people live in the house. Firefighters were able to get inside and rescue numerous occupants, but several were declared dead at the scene, the news release said.

(AP) — After driving through a downpour to take her son to day camp, Darleen Reyes told camp administrators the rain would have kept her away but her son insisted on going. As she marked her son's name present on a clipboard at the Boys and Girls Club camp, she laughed about braving a flash flood warning to get there. Before kissing his mother goodbye, Aiden Cazares, 8, explained to a reporter, “I wanted to see my friends and not just sit at home.” Then he ran off to play. Aiden's one of 1.4 million children and teenagers around the country who have been attending after-school and summer programming at a Boys and Girls Club, the YMCA or a public school for free thanks to federal taxpayers. Congress set aside money for the programs to provide academic support, enrichment and child care to mostly low-income families, but President Donald Trump's administration recently froze the funding. The money for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers is among more than $6 billion in federal education grants Trump's Republican administration has withheld, saying it wants to ensure recipients' programs align with the president's priorities. After-school programs for the fall are in jeopardy In Rhode Island, the state stepped in with funding to keep the summer programs running, according to the Boys and Girls Club of East Providence. Other Boys and Girls Clubs supported by the grants have found ways to keep open their summer programs, said Sara Leutzinger, vice president for communications for the Boys and Girls Club of America. But there isn't the same hope for the after-school programming for the fall. Some of the 926 Boys and Girls Clubs nationwide that run 21st Century Community Learning summer and after-school programs stand to close if the Trump administration doesn't release the money in the next three to five weeks, Leutzinger said. The YMCA and Save the Children say many of the centers they run are also at risk of shuttering. “Time is of the essence,” said Christy Gleason, executive director of Save the Children Action Network, which provides after-school programming for 41 schools in rural areas in Washington state and across the South, where school will begin as soon as August. “It's not too late to make a decision so the kids who really need this still have it.” Schools in Republican-led areas are particularly affected by the freeze in federal education grants. Ninety-one of the 100 school districts that receive the most money from four frozen grant programs are in Republican congressional districts, according to an analysis from New America, a left-leaning think tank. Of those top 100 school districts, half are in four states: California, West Virginia, Florida and Georgia. New America's analysis used funding levels reported in 2022 in 46 states. Republican officials have been among the educators criticizing the grant freeze. More in U.S. “I deeply believe in fiscal responsibility, which means evaluating the use of funds and seeking out efficiencies, but also means being responsible — releasing funds already approved by Congress and signed by President Trump,"" said Georgia schools superintendent Richard Woods, an elected Republican. “In Georgia, we're getting ready to start the school year, so I call on federal funds to be released so we can ensure the success of our students.” The Office of Management and Budget said some grants supported left-wing causes, pointing to services for immigrants in the country illegally or LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts. Summer clubs provide instruction for children At the East Providence summer camp, Aiden, a rising third grader, played tag, built structures with magnetic tiles, played a fast-paced game with the other kids to review addition and subtraction, learned about pollination, watched a nature video and ate club-provided chicken nuggets. Veteran teachers from his school corrected him when he spoke without raising his hand and offered common-sense advice when a boy in his group said something inappropriate. “When someone says something inappropriate, you don't repeat it,” teacher Kayla Creighton told the boys between answering their questions about horseflies and honeybees. Indeed, it's hard to find a more middle-of-the road organization in this country than the Boys and Girls Club. Just last month, a Republican and a Democrat sponsored a resolution in the U.S. House celebrating the 165-year-old organization as a “beacon of hope and opportunity.” The Defense Department awarded the club $3 million in 1991 to support children left behind when their parents deployed for the Persian Gulf. And ever since, the Boys and Girls Club has created clubs on military installations to support the children of service members. Military families can sign up their kids for free. “I suspect they will realize that most of those grants are fine and will release them,” said Mike Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative education policy think tank, speaking of the Trump administration's review of the 21st Century Community Learning Center grants. But not everyone is so sure. Families see few affordable child care alternatives Aiden's mother has started looking into afternoon child care for September when kids return to school in Rhode Island. “It costs $220 a week,” Reyes said, her eyes expanding. “I can't afford that.” The single mother and state worker said she'll probably ask her 14-year-old son to stay home and watch Aiden. That will mean he would have to forgo getting a job when he turns 15 in the fall and couldn't play basketball and football. “I don't have any other option,” she said. At home, Aiden would likely stay inside on a screen. That would be heartbreaking since he's thrived getting tutoring and “learning about healthy boundaries” from the Boys and Girls Club program, Reyes said. Fernande Berard learned about the funding freeze and possible closure from a reporter after dropping off her three young boys for summer camp. “I would be really devastated if this goes away,” said the nurse. “I honestly don't know what I would do.” Her husband drives an Uber much of the day, and picking up the kids early would eat into his earnings. It's money they need to pay the mortgage and everything else. If her boss approves, she'd likely have to pick up her children from school and take them to the rehabilitation center where she oversees a team of nurses...."

mov_0CA70DB83286CD5D82D2D2C6AC49E686,2025-07-14 11:09:56,en,WEB,"  NORFOLK, Va. – The Littoral Combat Ship USS Billings (LCS 15) was involved in a minor allision on July 4 while anchored in Rhode Island, striking a Collection Holding and Transfer (CHT) barge, a vessel used for collecting, holding, and transferring sewage and wastewater from ships. An allision occurs when a moving vessel strikes a stationary object, such as a dock, bridge, or another vessel at anchor. This differs from a collision, which involves two moving vessels. The incident prompted a swift response from Ship's Force personnel, who temporarily patched a hole just above the waterline to minimize flooding. Mid-Atlantic Regional Maintenance Center (MARMC) received the call to render aid and immediately began leading planning efforts for assessment and inevitable repairs. MARMC readied its Fly-Away Team, James Hopper, sheet metal zone manager, Caleb Grimes, ship fitter/welder and Hull Technician Second-Cass Petty Officer, Dakota Hamilton, who worked around the clock planning their approach for the emergent repair. MARMC's Fly-Away Team was accompanied by structural engineers from Southeast Regional Maintenance Center (SERMC) and Naval Surface Warfare Center (NSWC). MARMC's task was to take the lead and provide repair recommendations by July 5, just a day after the collision. ""On the morning of July 5, the MARMC Fly-Away Team fabricated a temporary hull patch and deployed to Rhode Island that evening,"" Hopper said. The team arrived at the Coast Guard station in Bristol, R.I., early on the morning of July 6 and was ferried out to the ship at anchor. Once onboard, the Fly-Away Team briefed Ship's Force on the patch installation procedure and immediately began the work. A temporary hull patch was successfully installed, enabling Billings to transit to Joint Expeditionary Base Little Creek in Virginia Beach, Va. for more durable and permanent repairs. “The damage control efforts implemented by Ship's Force were sufficient to minimize flooding onboard Billings; however, they were not deemed adequate for getting the ship underway,” said Hopper. Upon Billing's arrival at Little Creek, July 7, MARMC's Production Department was standing by on the pier to begin installation of a doubler-plate on the ship's hull. This installation enabled the ship to resume its operational commitments, unrestricted. Hopper added, “MARMC's Fly Away Team's swift fabrication and deployment clearly demonstrated the value of specialized mobile support teams. It's no small feat to go from patch design to install within 24 hours, especially when transit viability hinges on it.” “This response showcases exactly why our regional maintenance centers exist, to move fast, solve complex problems, and keep ships in the fight. MARMC and its partners delivered under pressure, and I'm proud of the team's speed, skill, and commitment to the fleet,” said Commander, Navy Regional Maintenance Center Rear Adm. Dan Lannamann. MARMC is renowned for answering both routine and emergent calls to “fix ships.” MARMC, a field activity under Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), provides surface ship maintenance, management and oversight of private sector maintenance and fleet technical assistance to ships in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States.

She is the only woman artist in this year's lineup of the annual tour. It features Little Anthony and the current iterations of the Turtles, Jay and the Americans, Gary Puckett & The Union Gap, the Vogues and the Cowsills, the group with which Susan Cowsill rose to fame in the second half of the 1960s. At 66, she is the youngest featured musician on this year's tour. Little Anthony is 84, Gary Puckett is 82. Cowsill is the only Happy Together Tour participant who is also a key member of another veteran band — the proudly rootsy Continental Drifters — which appeals to a younger and almost entirely different audience than any other Happy Together Tour acts. And she is the only one who, as an in-demand studio musician, has sung on albums by such diverse artists as Nanci Griffith, Hootie & the Blowfish, Dwight Twilley, Giant Sand, Red Kross and such Louisiana-bred acts as the Radiators and Zachary Richard. “I was a 'singer/entertainer' up until I was 30, which is when I learned to play guitar,” said Cowsill, speaking from her New Orleans home. “Then, I learned to be a musician and a songwriter, and that changed everything for me. It added to my already rich and wonderful life musical life.” Cowsill's musical life began unusually early by almost any standards. She was barely seven in 1966 when she joined her family's band, the Cowsills, which served as the real-life inspiration for the hit 1960s TV show “The Partridge Family.” The Cowsills featured her five older brothers — John, Paul, Barry, Bob and Bill — and their mother, Barbara. Their father, William “Bud” Cowsill, was their manager until a year after Susan became a member. The group made six albums between 1966 and 1971. Their hit singles included “The Rain, The Park and Other Things,” “Indian Lake” and the chart-topping “Hair,” the title track from the musical of the same name. “It obviously wasn't everyday life, but I didn't view being in the Cowsills as anything other than being in my family,” Susan Cowsill recalled. “We made life on the road very entertaining for ourselves. One year we had an early concert on Halloween and my dad arranged for me to go trick-or-treating in whatever city we were in. “We had a tutor on the road with us for really only one year. We went to 'professional schools' for a year in New York and in Los Angeles. They both had (options) where we could send in our work from the road, and that's what we did. Nobody learned anything! We were filling in each other's notebooks like crazy. It wasn't normal in any way shape or form.” With their wholesome image, rich vocal harmonies and well-crafted but unthreatening songs, the Cowsills were embraced as a clean-cut pop alternative to the increasingly more edgy rock music of the 1960s. Were Susan and her brothers eager to rebel and create less commercial, more challenging music than their record company would allow? “One hundred percent, but mostly my brothers,” she said. “I was the youngest and was more tagging along but paying attention. My brothers were amazing musicians and songwriters. They started as an R&B band and were very serious about what they were doing. As often happens, the image of the band was taken over by the record company and they went with the 'wholesome family' thing. That's okay, but the music got hijacked.” 'The band was done' The Cowsills disbanded after the release of their arresting 1971 album, the Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young-inspired “On My Side.” Susan was all of 12. At 14, she signed a record deal as a solo artist with Warner Bros. but released only two singles for the label. The first was “I Think of You,” the first cover version by any artist of any song by Sixto “Sugarman” Rodriguez. “When the band was done, the band was done,” Cowsill said. “I didn't know what I was to do. I was left to my own devices. We weren't really prepared for life when we left the Cowsills. I was the youngest and trying to figure out what kind of music would I do, or if I would even make music. Or would I become a schoolteacher?” The all-in-the-family band first reunited in 1978, then again in 1989, 1993 and 1998. “The Cowsills never break up, we just take breaks. And then we all show up,” Cowsill said. Both parents have passed away; mom Barbara in 1985 and dad William in 1992...."

Twenty-seven-year-old Aldino Centeio and 31-year-old Valdir Centeio had allegedly been fishing on Warren Beach in Little Compton on Saturday morning. Police said they received the 911 call around 8:30 a.m. at the Warren's Point Beach Club on Atlantic Drive. One of the brothers fell into the water, then the other jumped in to save him, according to police. A third fisherman also jumped in to save them, but was soon rescued by lifeguards. The third fisherman has not been identified. “We saw one gentleman standing on top of the rock behind me, screaming and yelling, waving his hands, sort of prostrating himself on the rock, crying. We figured obviously, someone had gone over into the water,” witness Bill Lancaster said. First responders, including the U.S. Coast Guard, searched for the brothers during the day on Saturday while the family watched, according to WPRI. The Little Compton Fire Department thanked the Warren's Point Beach Club and first responders from nearby towns for assisting them. The search was suspended overnight and picked back up on Sunday morning. Their bodies were eventually found around 11:15 a.m., not far from where they had gone missing, police say.

Twenty-seven-year-old Aldino Centeio and 31-year-old Valdir Centeio had allegedly been fishing on Warren Beach in Little Compton on Saturday morning. Police said they received the 911 call around 8:30 a.m. at the Warren's Point Beach Club on Atlantic Drive.

(WWLP) – Nine people have died and at least 30 others were injured in a fire at an assisted living facility in Massachusetts. According to the Massachusetts Department of Fire Services, the fire occurred at the Gabriel House assisted living facility in Fall River at about 9:50 p.m. Sunday. When crews arrived, heavy smoke was seen coming from the front of the building, with people trapped inside. Firefighters were able to rescue many of the occupants while battling the fire, which was out by Monday morning. About 70 people live in the house. About 50 firefighters responded, including 30 who were off-duty. “This is an unfathomable tragedy for the families involved and the Fall River community,” said Chief Jeffrey Bacon. “On behalf of the Fall River Fire Department, I want to express our heartfelt condolences to the loved ones who are grieving this morning.” He told reporters that “multiple people were hanging out the windows looking to be rescued.” Family members who showed up said police were trying to break windows.

My heart goes out to those who are waking up to the most horrific news imaginable about their loved ones this morning,"" Healey said.

mov_C3252C465A7B551E6DD2A3A88F94F497,2025-07-14 17:01:13,en,WEB,"  Demonstrators outside the U.S. Supreme Court as justices heard arguments in a case about abortion medication in March 2024. This year, lawmakers in at least eight states tried and failed to restrict access by classifying the drugs as controlled substances, and abortion opponents are still pushing for more federal restrictions. (Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/) Though many legislative sessions have concluded for the year, states could soon see more changes to reproductive health care access with new federal legislation that might lead to clinic closures, as well as pending health policies on abortion pills. Reduced access to abortion and reproductive health care are expected following the reconciliation budget bill President Donald Trump signed on July 4. It strips Medicaid funds from certain reproductive health care providers that also offer legal abortions, especially affecting Planned Parenthood. The largest nonprofit network of reproductive health clinics says an estimated 1 million Medicaid patients would likely lose access to services like birth control, cancer screenings and STI testing, and that it could end up closing 200 of its 600 clinics around the country, primarily in rural areas and in states where abortion is legal. Planned Parenthood sued the Trump administration, and a federal judge temporarily blocked the provision. Though the administration on Friday argued the temporary restraining order should not have been allowed and asked the judge to reverse course. Federal changes to medication abortion rules could also be coming soon, depending on how multiple lawsuits play out. This week one of those lawsuits, Washington v. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, ended in a loss in federal district court for the mostly Democratic-led states that sued to eliminate prescriber certification requirements they argue are burdensome. Just halfway through its first year in power, the Trump administration has already fulfilled many  requests from national anti-abortion groups. These groups are urging the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to add new requirements for medication abortion after Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he would review abortion opponents' claims, based on unpublished papers, that abortion-inducing drugs are unsafe. With federal policy changes poised to reshape the reproductive health care access landscape once again, it's a good time to get the lay of the land by taking a look at recent legislation that made its way into state code. In the first half of 2025, states with abortion bans considered making their bans even stricter. Many focused on limiting access to abortion pills, which dominates as the most widely available form of pregnancy termination. The vast majority of these new measures died in committee. But Louisiana passed a new law to further crack down on medication abortion access that's about to take effect in the coming weeks. Other abortion ban states clarified health exceptions and codified a right to birth control, while those with abortion access are working to pass privacy protections for providers and consumers. Attempts to restrict abortion pills Despite bans in nearly half the states, abortion rates are rising, according to organizations tracking the numbers, such as the Society of Family Planning, which found that 1 in 10 abortions were provided by online-only clinics in the first year after Roe v. Wade was overturned. This was largely made possible by federal policy that allows telehealth abortion care and for pharmacies to dispense the drugs directly to patients. According to the Center for Reproductive Rights, 18 states and the District of Columbia have laws shielding doctors who provide abortion care to patients from states where abortion is not legal. But according to UCLA Center for Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy, only California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington protect providers regardless of patient location. Meanwhile, officials in ban states have been working on legislation to try to prevent the mailing or distribution of the abortion drugs into their states, with Louisiana paving the way. This year Republican Gov. Jeff Landry signed into law House Bill 575, or the “Justice for Victims of Abortion Drug Dealers Act,” which goes into effect Aug. 1 and allows families to sue over suspected abortions. It expands liability to include a pregnant person's parents, the person who impregnated her, and anyone who causes or “substantially facilitates” an abortion. The new law also allows a judge to award at least $100,000 in damages if the defendant is not licensed to practice medicine or dispense medication in Louisiana. Attorney General Liz Murrill, who is prosecuting at least two cases involving New York-based Dr. Margaret Carpenter, said this law is “another tool in the toolbox” to use against out-of-state doctors who prescribe abortion medication to Louisianans via telemedicine. Last year, Louisiana became the first state to reclassify mifepristone and misoprostol as controlled dangerous substances, with Act 246, which is being challenged in court. Both drugs are also used to manage miscarriages and postpartum hemorrhage, as well as other conditions. The Louisiana Illuminator reported that some hospitals have started locking up these medications, making them more difficult for doctors to access for timely procedures. This year several states considered but failed to pass similar bills to reclassify abortion drugs as controlled substances, including Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma and Texas. In a special session in Texas — which is also suing Carpenter for allegedly prescribing medication abortion to a state resident — lawmakers are considering a bill that, like Louisiana's, would give the state new tools for cracking down on telehealth abortion. Senate Bill 2880 would allow anyone who manufactured, distributed, prescribed or provided abortion pills to be sued for $100,000; expand the wrongful death statute; and empower the attorney general to sue on behalf of  “unborn children of residents of this state.” Last session, the measure passed the state Senate but stalled in the House, Several other legislatures saw unsuccessful bills that would have banned the delivery and distribution of abortion-inducing drugs, including Arkansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia. A bill that would have required in-person visits for medication abortion failed in Nebraska. Clarifying abortion bans In a year when the Trump administration rescinded a Biden-era policy protecting the right to a medically necessary abortion in an emergency room and stories about health care denials continue to emerge, at least one state clarified the health exceptions in its law. Last month, Texas passed SB 31, titled the “Life of the Mother Act,” which allows abortion if the pregnant woman has a “life-threatening physical condition aggravated by, caused by, or arising from a pregnancy that places the female at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function.” The law notes that “a life-threatening physical condition is not necessarily one actively injuring the patient.” Proposed bans in states where voters approved abortion-rights amendments Lawmakers in Michigan and Ohio, where sessions are ongoing, have introduced total abortion bans to challenge voter-approved state constitutional amendments to protect reproductive rights. In Michigan, recently introduced House Bills 4670 and 4671 would create the “justice for babies in the womb act.” The bills, which are unlikely to pass, seek to extend legal personhood..."

mov_A96558E4CB3A6FCFC8543DD2B04C6258,2025-07-14 17:15:59,en,WEB,"  PROVIDENCE — Twenty-three states plus the District of Columbia have filed suit over the Trump administration's decision to withhold billions in funding for after-school and summer programs, adult education, English language acquisition and more, claiming the money was “unlawfully frozen” earlier this month and has caused “chaos” in plans to fund the upcoming school year. The suit was filed Monday in federal court in Providence against the US Department of Education, the Office of Management and Budget, and President Trump. All New England states except New Hampshire joined as plaintiffs. More than $100 million in education funding was withheld from Massachusetts on July 1, while $29 million was withheld from Rhode Island. More than $50 million was held back from Connecticut, and more than $25 million was withheld each from Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The lawsuit adds to a pile of legal challenges from mostly Democrat-led states over the Trump administration's actions, many of them involving frozen funding. Federal judges have ordered the administration to release funds in several of those cases. All of the states that signed on to Monday's lawsuit are led by Democratic governors other than Vermont, which is led by Republican Phil Scott. The US Department of Education unexpectedly withheld more than $6 billion in funds to all 50 states slated to be disbursed on July 1, writing in a three-sentence email after 5 p.m. on June 30 that the grants were under review to ensure “taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities.” The Office of Management and Budget later said in statement to the Globe that they were checking for funds that “subsidize a radical leftwing agenda,” including “illegal immigrant advocacy.” OMB has not responded to questions about when the review will be complete. The new lawsuit claims the Trump administration violated the Impoundment Control Act by failing to disburse money that was appropriated by Congress, which holds the power of the purse. The Trump administration has challenged the bounds of that law by repeatedly withholding funds during his second term, setting up a potential Supreme Court battle over impoundment. The six buckets of funding that were withheld on July 1 include money to educate the children of migrant workers, which in Massachusetts serves families who work in the agriculture and fishing industries. (Rhode Island does not receive any funds in this program.) It also includes funding for after-school and summer programs that are part of the 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which serve children in high-poverty, low-performing school districts. The money goes towards programs such as Boys & Girls Clubs, which offer activities before and after school, and run free or low cost summer camps. Families often rely on the programs as childcare while they are at work. “These funds go to the neediest students, where out-of-school time opportunities are lacking,” Andrew O'Leary, the superintendent of New Bedford Public Schools, said last week. He said if the funds aren't released, New Bedford would have to phase out a popular after-school program. Money for programs that help adults get a high school diploma or GED was also withheld, along with funding for students who are working towards becoming proficient in English. Teacher training money was also withheld. Summer programming for this year in Boston and Providence is largely unaffected because they are already funded, both cities' leaders have said, but the upcoming school year could see serious impacts if the money isn't released soon. “Significant cuts” are possible for after-school programming, said, Eric Gurna, the executive director of the Providence After-School Alliance, or PASA, which relies on the federal funding for half its $2 million annual budget. “In after-school, it's a chance for them to continue their learning, but it's also a chance for them to be active and healthy,” Gurna said. Rhode Island Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green said last week that layoffs are possible in the public school system, and decisions would need to be made in a matter of weeks. But she said she would first fight to get the funds released, including in court. “If I have to show up at the door of the Department of Education or OMB, wherever it is, I will do that,” Infante-Green said."

Maura Healey said following the deadly blaze. 7 minutes to read Share Close Send this article to your social connections. Send this article to your social connections. As a deadly blaze tore through a Fall River assisted living facility Sunday night, firefighters arrived to find flames erupting from the front door and some of the trapped residents hanging out of the windows, screaming and begging for help. Previously: Officials report 9 deaths in Fall River assisted living facility fire “That is something that none of us want to ever pull up to,” Fall River Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon told reporters Monday morning, describing the chaotic scene. “And unfortunately, … that happened here last night.” Nine people died and several more were injured in the five-alarm blaze at Gabriel House, one of them critically wounded. Five firefighters were also taken to the hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening, though Bacon said all five had been released by Monday morning. “We just pour our prayers out to the families of those who were hurt and killed,” Bacon told reporters. What happened? Firefighters responded to Gabriel House on Oliver Street at about 9:50 p.m. Sunday and found several residents trapped inside amid heavy smoke and flames, according to a news release from the state Fire Marshal's Office. The blaze drew about 50 firefighters to the scene, including 30 who were off-duty at the time, according to the release. Bacon said more than 30 people were transported from the scene, and “at least a dozen people [were] rescued over ladders.” “The police department, fire department, and EMS were able to enact dozens of rescues to save multiple lives in this case,” he explained during Monday's press conference. “So I applaud the efforts of them, but my heart goes out to the families of those who were injured, and especially the nine who lost their lives.” Bacon said the casualties were transported to several local hospitals, including Saint Anne's Hospital and Charlton Memorial Hospital in Fall River, St. Luke's Hospital in New Bedford, and Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. Some of the people who were killed died inside the facility, while others were pronounced dead after they were rushed from the scene, he said. “We're here to save lives, and any time that any life is lost, a single life that's lost is a tragedy in our minds. It's a failure of our job,” Bacon said. “But we know that there are forces beyond our control, and that things like this unfortunately happen. It still makes it difficult to talk about and to think about and to fathom, really, for anybody.” Appearing with Fall River officials at a later press conference, Gov. Maura Healey noted the impact on the facility's vulnerable residents. “It's horrifying to think about what happened in the middle of the night, in the dark,” she told reporters. “You had people just scrambling as best they could to get out through windows, the firefighters coming up ladders, you know, hauling people down in any way possible to get them out of the building. The panic. It's so heartbreaking and so sad, and something you never want to see.” What we know about the cause The fire's origin and cause are under investigation by Fall River police and fire officials, as well as Massachusetts State Police troopers with both the Fire Marshal's Office and the Bristol County District Attorney's Office. Asked about the status of the investigation Monday, Bacon had few details to offer. “It's all still under investigation,” he said during the press conference with Healey. “This is a very extensive investigation. It's going to take a lot of time, and we need to get the facts right before we release them.” The fire damage is limited to one wing, but Bacon said there is smoke damage throughout the assisted living facility. He confirmed the building had fire sprinklers, though he couldn't say whether they were activated during Sunday's blaze. “Smoke was everywhere in this building, from top to bottom and left to right,” he recalled during the press conference with Healey. The governor confirmed a “full investigation” into the fire is already underway and said she's been in contact with Fall River officials to express her condolences and offer state assistance. “My heart goes out to those who are waking up to the most horrific news imaginable about their loved ones this morning,” she said in an earlier statement. Authorities have not publicly named the people killed in the fire. “My heartfelt thanks and gratitude, deepest gratitude, to police, to fire, to EMS, and to all the first responders who showed up last night and worked through the night to save so many lives,” Healey added during the press conference. “We are so grateful to all of them.” Where are the survivors now? Soon after the fire, authorities set up a family notification center in the chapel of St. Anne's Hospital. Several Gabriel House residents have since been moved to the Timao Center, a shelter set up as a reunification site. “I was just hoping I was going to make it,” 78-year-old Neal Beck told The Boston Globe outside the center. “I was thinking about jumping out the bathroom window, but thank God I didn't because it's too high.”..."

I realised as soon as I placed the order and tried to go back and amend / cancel it, but that wasn't an option. I've emailed and dm'ed rhode about this to see if they can potentially change my address as I contacted them ASAP but I've read such bad reviews on their customer service that I'm feeling a bit hopeless since it was a very large order & placed on launch day.

Related video above: Maryland county expands child care amid possible federal funding cuts Aiden Cazares is one of 1.4 million children and teenagers around the country who have been attending after-school and summer programming at a Boys & Girls Club, the YMCA or a public school for free thanks to federal taxpayers. Congress set aside money for the programs to provide academic support, enrichment and child care to mostly low-income families, but President Donald Trump's administration recently froze the funding. The money for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers is among more than $6 billion in federal education grants Trump's Republican administration has withheld, saying it wants to ensure recipients' programs align with the president's priorities. After-school programs for the fall are in jeopardy In Rhode Island, the state stepped in with funding to keep the summer programs running, according to the Boys & Girls Club of East Providence. Other Boys & Girls Clubs supported by the grants have found ways to keep open their summer programs, said Sara Leutzinger, vice president for communications for the Boys & Girls Club of America. But there isn't the same hope for the after-school programming for the fall. Some of the 926 Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide that run 21st Century Community Learning summer and after-school programs stand to close if the Trump administration doesn't release the money in the next three to five weeks, Leutzinger said. The YMCA and Save the Children say many of the centers they run are also at risk of shuttering. “Time is of the essence,” said Christy Gleason, executive director of Save the Children Action Network, which provides after-school programming for 41 schools in rural areas in Washington state and across the South, where school will begin as soon as August. “It's not too late to make a decision so the kids who really need this still have it.” Schools in Republican-led areas are particularly affected by the freeze in federal education grants. Ninety-one of the 100 school districts that receive the most money from four frozen grant programs are in Republican congressional districts, according to an analysis from New America, a left-leaning think tank. Of those top 100 school districts, half are in four states: California, West Virginia, Florida and Georgia. New America's analysis used funding levels reported in 2022 in 46 states. Republican officials have been among the educators criticizing the grant freeze. “I deeply believe in fiscal responsibility, which means evaluating the use of funds and seeking out efficiencies, but also means being responsible — releasing funds already approved by Congress and signed by President Trump,"" said Georgia schools superintendent Richard Woods, an elected Republican. “In Georgia, we're getting ready to start the school year, so I call on federal funds to be released so we can ensure the success of our students.” The Office of Management and Budget said some grants supported left-wing causes, pointing to services for immigrants in the country illegally or LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts. Summer clubs provide instruction for children At the East Providence summer camp, Aiden, a rising third grader, played tag, built structures with magnetic tiles, played a fast-paced game with the other kids to review addition and subtraction, learned about pollination, watched a nature video and ate club-provided chicken nuggets. Veteran teachers from his school corrected him when he spoke without raising his hand and offered common-sense advice when a boy in his group said something inappropriate. “When someone says something inappropriate, you don't repeat it,” teacher Kayla Creighton told the boys between answering their questions about horseflies and honeybees. Indeed, it's hard to find a more middle-of-the road organization in this country than the Boys & Girls Club. Just last month, a Republican and a Democrat sponsored a resolution in the U.S. House celebrating the 165-year-old organization as a “beacon of hope and opportunity.” The Defense Department awarded the club $3 million in 1991 to support children left behind when their parents deployed for the Persian Gulf. And ever since, the Boys & Girls Club has created clubs on military installations to support the children of service members. Military families can sign up their kids for free. “I suspect they will realize that most of those grants are fine and will release them,” said Mike Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative education policy think tank, speaking of the Trump administration's review of the 21st Century Community Learning Center grants. But not everyone is so sure. Families see few affordable child care alternatives Aiden's mother has started looking into afternoon child care for September when kids return to school in Rhode Island. “It costs $220 a week,” Reyes said, her eyes expanding. “I can't afford that.” The single mother and state worker said she'll probably ask her 14-year-old son to stay home and watch Aiden. That will mean he would have to forgo getting a job when he turns 15 in the fall and couldn't play basketball and football. “I don't have any other option,” she said. At home, Aiden would likely stay inside on a screen. That would be heartbreaking since he's thrived getting tutoring and “learning about healthy boundaries” from the Boys & Girls Club program, Reyes said. Fernande Berard learned about the funding freeze and possible closure from a reporter after dropping off her three young boys for summer camp. “I would be really devastated if this goes away,” said the nurse. “I honestly don't know what I would do.” Her husband drives an Uber much of the day, and picking up the kids early would eat into his earnings. It's money they need to pay the mortgage and everything else. If her boss approves, she'd likely have to pick up her children from school and take them to the rehabilitation center where she oversees a team of nurses. The children would have to stay until her work day ends. “It's hard to imagine,” she said."

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island and alleges that the federal government illegally withheld money that was required, by law, to go to states on July 1. Other states joining Colorado — which is owed $80 million — include California, Rhode Island, North Carolina, Kentucky, and New Mexico. The District of Columbia is also part of the suit. “I am here appalled; I am here in disbelief,” Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said during a news conference announcing the lawsuit. “…We will have the backs of parents, teachers and kids.” The frozen K-12 funding was appropriated by Congress for students learning English, teacher training, and after-school and summer programs. But the U.S. Department of Education told state education officials earlier this month that the money was being withheld pending a review and hasn't said if it will be released. “Congress holds the power of the purse — not the president,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said during the news conference. “…Trump and (U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon) have no right to hold these funds back.” Colorado school districts expected to receive about $80 million, and many have already budgeted the funds, including hiring employees for the new academic year. School districts have already finalized their budgets for the 2025-26 academic year, which begins next month. Several districts have said they will have to cut jobs and programs in the coming weeks if they don't receive the money the federal government promised. Education leaders and advocates — from the state's largest teachers union to the Colorado Rural Schools Alliance — have urged the Trump administration to immediately release the money. Gov. Jared Polis and Democratic members of Colorado's congressional delegation echoed their calls. “The decision to delay the distribution of congressionally appropriated education funds is a dangerous overreach of executive authority and a direct affront to public education, especially for communities that rely most heavily on these supports,” said Denver Public Schools Superintendent Alex Marrero and Board of Education President Carrie Olson in a joint statement earlier this month.

The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island and alleges that the federal government illegally withheld money that was required, by law, to go to states on July 1. Other states joining Colorado — which is owed $80 million — include California, Rhode Island, North Carolina, Kentucky, and New Mexico. The District of Columbia is also part of the suit. “I am here appalled; I am here in disbelief,” Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said during a news conference announcing the lawsuit. “…We will have the backs of parents, teachers and kids.” The frozen K-12 funding was appropriated by Congress for students learning English, teacher training, and after-school and summer programs. But the U.S. Department of Education told state education officials earlier this month that the money was being withheld pending a review and hasn't said if it will be released. “Congress holds the power of the purse — not the president,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta said during the news conference. “…Trump and (U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon) have no right to hold these funds back.” Colorado school districts expected to receive about $80 million, and many have already budgeted the funds, including hiring employees for the new academic year.

(AP) — More than 20 states have sued President Donald Trump's administration over billions of dollars in frozen funding for after-school and summer programs and other programs. Aiden Cazares is one of 1.4 million children and teenagers around the country who have been attending after-school and summer programming at a Boys & Girls Club, the YMCA or a public school for free thanks to federal taxpayers. Congress set aside money for the programs to provide academic support, enrichment and child care to mostly low-income families, but President Donald Trump's administration recently froze the funding. The money for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers is among more than $6 billion in federal education grants Trump's Republican administration has withheld, saying it wants to ensure recipients' programs align with the president's priorities. On Monday afternoon, more than 20 Democratic-led states sued the Trump administration to force the release of the money. Led by California, the lawsuit alleges withholding the money violates the Constitution and several federal laws. Many low-income families will lose access to after-school programs if the money isn't released soon, according to the suit. In some states, school restarts in late July and early August. After-school programs for the fall are in jeopardy In Rhode Island, the state stepped in with funding to keep the summer programs running, according to the Boys & Girls Club of East Providence. Other Boys & Girls Clubs supported by the grants have found ways to keep open their summer programs, said Sara Leutzinger, vice president for communications for the Boys & Girls Club of America. But there isn't the same hope for the after-school programming for the fall. Some of the 926 Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide that run 21st Century Community Learning summer and after-school programs stand to close if the Trump administration doesn't release the money in the next three to five weeks, Leutzinger said. The YMCA and Save the Children say many of the centers they run are also at risk of shuttering. “Time is of the essence,” said Christy Gleason, executive director of Save the Children Action Network, which provides after-school programming for 41 schools in rural areas in Washington state and across the South, where school will begin as soon as August. “It's not too late to make a decision so the kids who really need this still have it.” Schools in Republican-led areas are particularly affected by the freeze in federal education grants. Ninety-one of the 100 school districts that receive the most money from four frozen grant programs are in Republican congressional districts, according to an analysis from New America, a left-leaning think tank. Of those top 100 school districts, half are in four states: California, West Virginia, Florida and Georgia. New America's analysis used funding levels reported in 2022 in 46 states. Republican officials have been among the educators criticizing the grant freeze. “I deeply believe in fiscal responsibility, which means evaluating the use of funds and seeking out efficiencies, but also means being responsible — releasing funds already approved by Congress and signed by President Trump,"" said Georgia schools superintendent Richard Woods, an elected Republican. “In Georgia, we're getting ready to start the school year, so I call on federal funds to be released so we can ensure the success of our students.” The Office of Management and Budget said some grants supported left-wing causes, pointing to services for immigrants in the country illegally or LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts. Summer clubs provide instruction for children At the East Providence summer camp, Aiden, a rising third grader, played tag, built structures with magnetic tiles, played a fast-paced game with the other kids to review addition and subtraction, learned about pollination, watched a nature video and ate club-provided chicken nuggets. Veteran teachers from his school corrected him when he spoke without raising his hand and offered common-sense advice when a boy in his group said something inappropriate. “When someone says something inappropriate, you don't repeat it,” teacher Kayla Creighton told the boys between answering their questions about horseflies and honeybees. Indeed, it's hard to find a more middle-of-the road organization in this country than the Boys & Girls Club. Just last month, a Republican and a Democrat sponsored a resolution in the U.S. House celebrating the 165-year-old organization as a “beacon of hope and opportunity.” The Defense Department awarded the club $3 million in 1991 to support children left behind when their parents deployed for the Persian Gulf. And ever since, the Boys & Girls Club has created clubs on military installations to support the children of service members. Military families can sign up their kids for free. “I suspect they will realize that most of those grants are fine and will release them,” said Mike Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a conservative education policy think tank, speaking of the Trump administration's review of the 21st Century Community Learning Center grants. But not everyone is so sure. Families see few affordable child care alternatives Aiden's mother has started looking into afternoon child care for September when kids return to school in Rhode Island. “It costs $220 a week,” Aiden's mother, Darleen Reyes, said, her eyes expanding. “I can't afford that.” The single mother and state worker said she'll probably ask her 14-year-old son to stay home and watch Aiden. That will mean he would have to forgo getting a job when he turns 15 in the fall and couldn't play basketball and football. “I don't have any other option,” she said. At home, Aiden would likely stay inside on a screen. That would be heartbreaking since he's thrived getting tutoring and “learning about healthy boundaries” from the Boys & Girls Club program, Reyes said. Fernande Berard learned about the funding freeze and possible closure from a reporter after dropping off her three young boys for summer camp. “I would be really devastated if this goes away,” said the nurse. “I honestly don't know what I would do.” Her husband drives an Uber much of the day, and picking up the kids early would eat into his earnings. It's money they need to pay the mortgage and everything else. If her boss approves, she'd likely have to pick up her children from school and take them to the rehabilitation center where she oversees a team of nurses...."

No, they cannot cure their awful 32-65 record by merely regrouping and catching their breath. Their campaign was over before Opening Day, at least from a competitive standpoint. What the beleaguered franchise can do now, however, is build for the future. The MLB Draft, which began Sunday night and wraps up on Monday, affords the front office an opportunity to seize hope. And according to a couple of baseball insiders, the White Sox may have made the most of it. Chicago grabbed 18-year-old shortstop Billy Carlson with the No. 10 overall selection. The prospect is garnering copious praise for his sensational defensive skills but also boasts offensive upside, prompting two ESPN writers to label him as a potential gem. One even mentioned Carlson in the same sentence as the 2024 American League runner-up, calling him the steal of the draft. “I'm going with Billy Carlson with the 10th pick — with the admitted caveat that the White Sox haven't exactly been stellar at developing hitters,” David Schoenfield notes. “But Carlson looks like an elite defensive shortstop with plus power, and that alone can make him a valuable major leaguer. If the hit tool comes along, we're looking at a potential star. OK, he's Bobby Witt Jr. lite? That's still an All-Star player.” The White Sox hope they scooped up an undeniable difference-maker Carlson shined at Corona High School, the same place that also helped develop right-handed pitcher and No. 6 overall pick Seth Hernandez (Pittsburgh Pirates). If he can complement his superb arm with a consistent bat, this young talent could become a vital component of the White Sox for the many years to come. Jesse Rogers, who covers the ballclub for ESPN, listed Carlson as his favorite pick of the night. “I'm loving Billy Carlson to the White Sox at No. 10,” he writes. “Though they lost 121 games last season, Chicago couldn't pick higher than this spot per CBA rules — but the Sox might have gotten a top-five player. Carlson's defense will play extremely well behind a sneaky good and young pitching staff that should keep the ball on the ground in the long term.” The onus is on general manager Chris Getz to take advantage of the team's fortuitous draft position and identify a potential franchise pillar. Chicago may have to wait several years to find out if Carlson is indeed a star-in-the-making, but the early feedback is incredibly encouraging. The White Sox are coming off a historically miserable 2024 campaign and presently sit 19 and a half games out of a playoff slot, so they have to celebrate victories whenever they can.

The lawsuit argues the Trump administration has violated the Constitution and several federal laws by stopping $6 billion in funding that goes to after-school programs, English lessons for non-native speakers, training for teachers, expansion of science and arts curricula and anti-bullying programs. The money, which is normally released on July 1, was held unexpectedly, with no timeline regarding when the government may release it. “The federal government cannot use our children's classrooms to advance its assault on immigrant and working families,” said New York Attorney General James. “This illegal and unjustified funding freeze will be devastating for students and families nationwide, especially for those who rely on these programs for childcare or to learn English. Congress allocated these funds, and the law requires they be delivered.

Initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda. In one case, NY public schools used English Language Acquisition funds to promote illegal immigrant advocacy organizations. In another, Washington state used funds to direct illegal immigrants towards scholarships intended for American students,” a spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said. The effects of this pause have been immediate, with the lawsuit alleging summer programs have already been canceled or are at risk, and classes for teacher development or English learners have been stalled or scaled back. The states say they had no time to make up the funding gap, as there was no heads-up on the pause. The states are seeking a preliminary injunction and for the judge to compel the federal government to release the funding.

(AP) — Más de 20 estados demandaron el lunes a la administración del presidente Donald Trump por miles de millones de dólares en fondos educativos congelados para el cuidado después de la escuela, programas de verano y más. Parte del dinero retenido financia programas después de la escuela y de verano en Boys & Girls Clubs, la YMCA o escuelas públicas, a los que asisten 1,4 millones de niños y adolescentes en todo el país. El Congreso reservó dinero para los programas con el fin de proporcionar apoyo académico, enriquecimiento y cuidado infantil a familias mayormente de bajos ingresos. Pero la administración de Trump congeló recientemente los fondos, diciendo que quiere asegurarse de que los programas de los beneficiarios se alineen con las prioridades del presidente republicano. Liderada por California, la demanda alega que retener el dinero viola la Constitución y varias leyes federales. Muchas familias de bajos ingresos perderán acceso a programas después de la escuela si el dinero no se libera pronto, según la demanda. En algunos estados, las clases escolares comienzan a finales de julio y principios de agosto.

Antes de despedirse de su madre con un beso, Aiden Cazares, de 8 años, explicó a un reportero: ""Quería ver a mis amigos y no solo quedarme en casa"". Luego salió corriendo a jugar. En Rhode Island, el estado intervino con fondos para mantener los programas de verano en funcionamiento, según el Boys & Girls Club de East Providence. Otros Boys & Girls Clubs apoyados por las subvenciones han encontrado formas de mantener abiertos sus programas de verano, declaró Sara Leutzinger, vicepresidenta de comunicaciones del Boys & Girls Club of America. Pero no hay la misma esperanza para los programas para el otoño. Algunos de los 926 Boys & Girls Clubs en todo el país que ejecutan programas de verano y después de la escuela del 21st Century Community Learning están en riesgo de cerrar si la administración de Trump no libera el dinero en las próximas tres a cinco semanas, indicó Leutzinger.

""No es demasiado tarde para tomar una decisión para que los niños que realmente necesitan esto aún lo tengan"". Las escuelas en áreas lideradas por republicanos están particularmente afectadas por la congelación de subvenciones federales para la educación. Noventa y uno de los 100 distritos escolares que reciben más dinero de cuatro programas de subvenciones congelados están en distritos congresionales republicanos, según un análisis de New America, un grupo de expertos de tendencia izquierdista. De esos 100 principales distritos escolares, la mitad están en cuatro estados: California, Virginia Occidental, Florida y Georgia. El análisis de New America utilizó niveles de financiamiento reportados en 2022 en 46 estados. Los funcionarios republicanos han estado entre los educadores que critican la congelación de las subvenciones. ""Creo profundamente en la responsabilidad fiscal, lo que significa evaluar el uso de los fondos y buscar eficiencias, pero también significa ser responsable: liberar fondos ya aprobados por el Congreso y firmados por el presidente Trump"", sostuvo Richard Woods, superintendente de escuelas de Georgia, un republicano electo. ""En Georgia, nos estamos preparando para comenzar el año escolar, por lo que hago un llamado a que se liberen los fondos federales para que podamos asegurar el éxito de nuestros estudiantes"".

Los maestros veteranos de su escuela lo corrigieron cuando habló sin levantar la mano y ofrecieron consejos de sentido común cuando un niño de su grupo dijo algo inapropiado.

mov_4371B4BAEFD1046D3B1C21244FA730F6,2025-07-14 19:20:54,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]EAST PROVIDENCE, Rhode Island, EE. UU. (AP) — Más de 20 estados demandaron el lunes a la administración del presidente Donald Trump por miles de millones de dólares en fondos educativos congelados para el cuidado después de la escuela, programas de verano y más. Parte del dinero retenido financia programas después de la escuela y de verano en Boys & Girls Clubs, la YMCA o escuelas públicas, a los que asisten 1,4 millones de niños y adolescentes en todo el país. El Congreso reservó dinero para los programas con el fin de proporcionar apoyo académico, enriquecimiento y cuidado infantil a familias mayormente de bajos ingresos, pero la administración de Trump congeló recientemente los fondos, diciendo que quiere asegurarse de que los programas de los beneficiarios se alineen con las prioridades del presidente republicano. Liderada por California, la demanda alega que retener el dinero viola la Constitución y varias leyes federales. Muchas familias de bajos ingresos perderán acceso a programas después de la escuela si el dinero no se libera pronto, según la demanda. En algunos estados, las clases escolares comienzan a finales de julio y principios de agosto. Darleen Reyes condujo bajo una lluvia torrencial la semana pasada para llevar a su hijo a un campamento diurno gratuito de Boys & Girls Club en East Providence, Rhode Island. Ella les dijo a los administradores del campamento que la advertencia de inundación repentina la habría mantenido alejada, pero su hijo insistió en ir. Antes de despedirse de su madre con un beso, Aiden Cazares, de 8 años, explicó a un reportero: ""Quería ver a mis amigos y no solo quedarme en casa"". Luego salió corriendo a jugar. Los programas para el otoño están en peligro En Rhode Island, el estado intervino con fondos para mantener los programas de verano en funcionamiento, según el Boys & Girls Club de East Providence. Otros Boys & Girls Clubs apoyados por las subvenciones han encontrado formas de mantener abiertos sus programas de verano, declaró Sara Leutzinger, vicepresidenta de comunicaciones del Boys & Girls Club of America, pero no hay la misma esperanza para los programas para el otoño. Algunos de los 926 Boys & Girls Clubs en todo el país que ejecutan programas de verano y después de la escuela del 21st Century Community Learning están en riesgo de cerrar si la administración de Trump no libera el dinero en las próximas tres a cinco semanas, indicó Leutzinger. La YMCA y Save the Children dicen que muchos de los centros que administran también están en riesgo de cerrar. ""Se nos está agotando el tiempo"", señaló Christy Gleason, directora ejecutiva del brazo político de Save the Children, que proporciona programas después de la escuela para 41 escuelas en áreas rurales en el estado de Washington y en todo el sur, donde la escuela comenzará tan pronto como en agosto. ""No es demasiado tarde para tomar una decisión para que los niños que realmente necesitan esto aún lo tengan"". Las escuelas en áreas lideradas por republicanos están particularmente afectadas por la congelación de subvenciones federales para la educación. Noventa y uno de los 100 distritos escolares que reciben más dinero de cuatro programas de subvenciones congelados están en distritos congresionales republicanos, según un análisis de New America, un grupo de expertos de tendencia izquierdista. De esos 100 principales distritos escolares, la mitad están en cuatro estados: California, Virginia Occidental, Florida y Georgia. El análisis de New America utilizó niveles de financiamiento reportados en 2022 en 46 estados. Los funcionarios republicanos han estado entre los educadores que critican la congelación de las subvenciones. ""Creo profundamente en la responsabilidad fiscal, lo que significa evaluar el uso de los fondos y buscar eficiencias, pero también significa ser responsable: liberar fondos ya aprobados por el Congreso y firmados por el presidente Trump"", sostuvo Richard Woods, superintendente de escuelas de Georgia, un republicano electo. ""En Georgia, nos estamos preparando para comenzar el año escolar, por lo que hago un llamado a que se liberen los fondos federales para que podamos asegurar el éxito de nuestros estudiantes"". La Oficina de Administración y Presupuesto dijo que algunas subvenciones apoyaban causas de izquierda, señalando servicios para inmigrantes en el país ilegalmente o esfuerzos de inclusión LGBTQ+. En el campamento de verano de East Providence, Aiden, un estudiante que pasará a tercer grado, jugó a las atrapadas, construyó estructuras con baldosas magnéticas, jugó un juego rápido con los otros niños para repasar sumas y restas, aprendió sobre la polinización, vio un video de naturaleza y comió nuggets de pollo proporcionados por el club. Los maestros veteranos de su escuela lo corrigieron cuando habló sin levantar la mano y ofrecieron consejos de sentido común cuando un niño de su grupo dijo algo inapropiado. ""Cuando alguien dice algo inapropiado, no lo repites"", afirmó la maestra Kayla Creighton a los niños entre responder sus preguntas sobre tábanos y abejas. De hecho, es difícil encontrar una organización más moderada en este país que el Boys & Girls Club. El mes pasado, un republicano y un demócrata patrocinaron una resolución en la Cámara de Representantes celebrando a la organización de 165 años como un ""faro de esperanza y oportunidad"". El Departamento de Defensa otorgó al club US$3 millones en 1991 para apoyar a los niños que quedaron atrás cuando sus padres fueron desplegados para el Golfo Pérsico. Y desde entonces, el Boys & Girls Club ha creado clubes en instalaciones militares para apoyar a los hijos de los miembros del servicio. Las familias militares pueden inscribir a sus hijos de forma gratuita. ""Sospecho que se darán cuenta de que la mayoría de esas subvenciones están bien y las liberarán"", aseveró Mike Petrilli, presidente del Thomas B. Fordham Institute, un grupo de expertos en políticas educativas conservadoras, hablando sobre la revisión de la administración Trump de las subvenciones del 21st Century Community Learning Center. Pero no todos están tan seguros. La madre de Aiden ha comenzado a buscar cuidado infantil por la tarde para septiembre, cuando los niños regresen a la escuela en Rhode Island. ""Cuesta US$220 a la semana"", expresó Reyes, con los ojos muy abiertos. ""No puedo permitírmelo"". La madre soltera y trabajadora estatal dijo que probablemente pedirá a su hijo de 14 años que se quede en casa y cuide de Aiden. Eso significará que tendría que renunciar a conseguir un trabajo cuando cumpla 15 años en el otoño y no podría jugar baloncesto y fútbol. ""No tengo otra opción"", manifestó la madre. En casa, Aiden probablemente se quedaría dentro frente a una pantalla. Eso sería desgarrador, ya que ha prosperado recibiendo tutoría y ""aprendiendo sobre límites saludables"" del programa del Boys & Girls Club, destacó Reyes. Fernande Berard se enteró de la congelación de fondos y el posible cierre por un reportero después de dejar a sus tres hijos pequeños en el campamento de verano. ""Realmente estaría devastada si esto desaparece"", expresó la enfermera. ""Honestamente, no sé qué haría"". Su esposo conduce un Uber gran parte del día, y recoger a los niños temprano reduciría sus ganancias. Es dinero que necesitan para pagar la hipoteca y todo lo demás...."

Photo: Parents / Ethan Miller via NFL star Christian McCaffrey and his wife, model Olivia Culpo, announced the birth of their first child, a baby girl named Colette Annalise McCaffrey, in an Instagram post on July 13, 2025. A carousel of black and white photos taken at birth is captioned with the baby's name and a simple white heart. Culpo, 33, also shared birth photos on her story where she described her C-section delivery as “the scariest and most rewarding of all experiences.” The couple recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary after getting married in Rhode Island last summer and announced this next chapter in March. The new mom had previously told People she was excited and grateful to be pregnant, having dreamed of it for a long time. She also said she was keeping an open mind about her parenting style, already knowing some things are out of her control, after watching so many friends and family members parent. Her pregnancy journey was complicated in the first trimester, and she spoke openly of early bed rest and a bout with pneumonia that lasted for two weeks. She is also an advocate for others facing endometriosis, a condition she shares. After facing these early challenges, the arrival of a healthy baby girl is all the sweeter. McCaffrey and Culpo chose a unique and elegant name for their little one, reflecting a chic French aesthetic. Here are all of the details: Origin: French, derived from Greek Meaning: “People of Victory,” according to Nameberry. Similar Names and Variations: Nicole, Nicolette Famous Namesakes: This is a rarer name among notables and most closely associated with French author Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette, famous for the novella Gigi. Peak Popularity: Colette debuted on the Social Security Administration's (SSA) top 1000 baby girl names in 1928 but disappeared off the chart in the mid-1980s. Rediscovered in 2012 and trending upward since, it reached its peak in 2024 at number 400. Origin: German, a combination of Anna and Lise. Meaning: “Grace and pledged to God,” according to Nameberry. Similar Names and Variations: Anneliese, Lisa, Liese, Anna, Elizabeth Famous Namesakes: American actress Annalise Basso, Irish sailor and silver medalist at the 2016 Olympics, Annalise Murphy. Peak Popularity: This name peaked recently in 2021 when it jumped to 385 on the SSA's top baby girl names. It has held steady in the top 500 since then and ended 2024 in the 462nd spot. Little Colette Annalise makes her arrival just before the start of a new football season for McCaffrey, 28, who ended his season in the Super Bowl last year with the San Francisco 49ers. Speaking of the running back as a new dad, Culpo described the bond as a “love like no other.”"

mov_8E2957581C028812DED904E81796F059,2025-07-14 19:37:34,en,WEB,"  RALEIGH, N.C. (WNCN) — North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined two dozen other states in a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Monday, seeking to restore access to $165 million in state education funds. Jackson, along with attorneys general and governors from 24 other states nationwide, sued in federal court to challenge a move by the executive branch to withhold $6.8 billion in congressionally approved federal funding for K-12 schools. The suit, which was filed in the U.S. District Court of Rhode Island, argued that the decision to freeze these funds resulted in “chaos” for schools across the country. Jackson said almost 1,000 educators in North Carolina would lose their jobs, with the cuts making up nearly 10% of federal educational funding intended for the state. “Public schools across North Carolina, especially in rural areas, need this money to keep teachers in the classroom and keep kids safe while they learn,” Jackson said in a released statement. “It's unlawful and unconstitutional for the Department of Education to withhold money that Congress has appropriated. I'm going to court to get this money for our students, our schools, and North Carolina families.” “Today, North Carolina is taking action to unfreeze funding for North Carolina public schools that was appropriated by Congress,” North Carolina Governor Josh Stein said. “Without these funds, nearly 1,000 teachers will have their jobs taken from them. The money also provides after-school programs, supports children learning English, and helps adults learn how to read. “Schools are counting on these funds; without them, they will be left scrambling as kids return to classrooms,” Stein added. “I thank Attorney General Jackson for bringing his action and call on the U.S. Department of Education to release the funds that North Carolina is owed.” North Carolina leaders said the federal grant funding at stake in this lawsuit supports state school budgets, teacher salaries, before and after-school programs for students, community learning centers and teacher development programs, among others. “While the N.C. Department of Public Instruction respects the federal administration's right to review programs, I must emphasize that our legal obligations to serve these students remain unchanged, and the timing creates significant and unnecessary challenges for schools, community organizations, and most importantly, the children who depend on these services,” North Carolina Superintendent of Public Instruction Maurice (Mo) Green said in a statement. “I support efforts, including this nationwide lawsuit, to resolve this situation quickly and ensure that North Carolina students receive the support they need and deserve and that our federal government agreed to provide them.” The states that united in Monday's legal action included the following: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

mov_6D67D8EEC27198ECAF9C56FF416A73BF,2025-07-14 20:04:16,en,WEB,"  NEWPORT, R.I. – Roughly 250 youngsters, ages 9 to 17, and 150 parents and guardians participated in Bring a Child to Work Day, which is designed to introduce family members of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC) Division Newport employees to the science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) work conducted on a daily basis at the warfare center. “The displays and interactions with our future scientists and engineers are critical to inspiring the next generation,” Commanding Officer Capt. Chad Hennings said about the annual event. “The effort that NUWC Division Newport puts into this day is second to none in my experience.” The event kicked off with morning colors, a military tradition that dates back to 1797 with the Royal Navy and was adopted by the U.S. Navy in 1843, Hennings explained. Members of Division Newport's Military Detachment raised the American flag before the playing of “The Star-Spangled Banner” at 8 a.m. sharp. A popular event was a visit to the Submarine Bridge Trainer, a state-of-the-art system that allows Sailors to virtually navigate harbors worldwide from atop the submarine sail. Located in a two-story space, the IMAX theater-like trainer provides a 360-degree horizontal and 70-degree vertical dynamic visual simulation for users, with a real-life sea state aboard a submarine. Adam Dai, a software engineer in the Undersea Warfare Electromagnetic Systems Department, invited his daughter to Bring a Child to Work Day and said the event is beneficial not only for children, but also adults. Other stops for Dai and his daughter included the Materials Laboratory, the Anechoic Chamber, and an annual favorite, the Acoustic Wind Tunnel. “I think it's awesome because we work on our own thing and we don't often get a chance to see other departments' stuff, whether we're too busy or have too many meetings,” Dai said. Dr. Lynn Antonelli, an engineer in the Sensors and Sonar Systems Department, led a laser demonstration, where attendees learned about refraction, diffraction and polarization. Marian Lee, a technician in Undersea Warfare Electromagnetic Systems Department, brought his two sons, who said they enjoyed the experience. Jacob Lee, age 14, particularly enjoyed seeing his pulse being measured on a large screen by a laser after engineer Nicole Dusang, an employee in the Sensors and Sonar Systems Department, placed a small piece of reflective tape on his neck that bounced the light back to an interferometer. “It's really cool because you get to see the vibrations when people are talking or swallowing, which is projected on the screen,” said Jacob, a rising ninth-grader at Ledyard High School in Connecticut. In terms of future plans, Jacob said he might follow in his dad's footsteps. “I'm thinking about possibly working here, or possibly at Electric Boat,” he said. Another highlight was the laser maze, where participants attempted to get through the course unscathed while the theme from James Bond movies played in a darkened room. Mindy Darosa and Maddy Doherty, engineers in the Undersea Warfare Platforms and Payload Integration Department, provided an overview of the differences between the Tomahawk and Harpoon missiles. Bill Santosuosso of the Undersea Warfare Platforms and Payload Integration Department explained the work done with the Submarine Launcher System Test Facility, and support contractor Jason Valdes offered a demonstration of how the three-inch countermeasure launcher works. Before firing the launcher, Valdes warned attendees the machine emits a booming noise that rattles the building and cautioned them to plug their ears with their fingers. But the blast wasn't too bad, said some of the attendees. It was a family affair at the Missile Electronic Simulator Engineering Facility for Sarah Brown, an engineer in the Undersea Warfare Platforms and Payload Integration Department, who brought four children, including her son Isaac, age 17. The family spent a significant amount of time with the Embedded Systems team exploring the basic electronics and software used for testing equipment. Isaac took a particular interest in the Tomahawk Missile Simulator, used to mimic missiles before they are launched. “I'm looking at that thing right there and wondering how much data you need with a ribbon cable that big,” he said, pointing at the simulator. Children also got to see some of the simulation software used by the U.S. Navy to train Sailors and build prototypes. The Virtual Worlds exhibit was designed like a video game, where participants were represented by an avatar in search of hidden pieces to build a submarine model. There was also an opportunity to learn how whales, dolphins and other marine mammals interact with the environment. Several members of the Environmental Branch of the Corporate Operations Department guided attendees through multiple stations to view skulls, vertebrae, ribs and fins and encouraged hands-on interaction with various activities to help understand the point of view of marine mammals. NUWC Newport is the oldest warfare center in the country, tracing its heritage to the Naval Torpedo Station established on Goat Island in Newport Harbor in 1869. Commanded by Capt. Chad Hennings, NUWC Newport maintains major detachments in West Palm Beach, Florida, and Andros Island in the Bahamas, as well as test facilities at Seneca Lake and Fisher's Island, New York, Leesburg, Florida, and Dodge Pond, Connecticut.

mov_94ACDEB377CCC44A24FC8529FDA01013,2025-07-14 20:09:48,en,WEB,"  Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha joined three other attorneys general in a press conference July 14 to announce a lawsuit against President Donald Trump's administration over its withholding of $6.8 billion nationwide in federal funds for education. Neronha said in a press release that Rhode Island was supposed to receive $29 million to fund all kinds of educational programs and services in the state, including programs for migratory children and English language learners and those that improve school conditions and the use of technology in the classroom, as well as community learning centers and adult education efforts. Funding is typically released to states on July 1 so that schools can budget for summer programs and the upcoming academic year. But this year, the Trump administration sent a three-sentence email in the evening of June 30, saying they would be withholding the funds for “review” on whether the funds align with the “President's priorities.” Neronha said that this action harms Rhode Islanders. “We know that our economy, the success of our economy, both in the present and long term, depends on the education of Americans and Rhode Islanders. And every step that the President takes to harm education harms not only individuals, but our overall economy,” Neronha said at the press conference. “Because the President is taking money from our state budgets, it is impossible for states to effectively budget for an upcoming school year through their departments of education and through our departments of education to our local communities.” Neronha added in the press release that summer school and afterschool programs are already being impacted. On July 9, Rhode Island Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green said that “everyone is going to feel this.” Neronha is co-leading the lawsuit, which was filed in Rhode Island, with the attorneys general of California, Colorado and Massachusetts, who also attended the press conference. They are leading a coalition of 23 attorneys general, including Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, as well as the governors of Pennsylvania and Kentucky. The attorneys general were bullish about their possibility of winning this case. The attorneys general are arguing that the funding freeze violates the federal funding statutes and regulations and violates the constitutional separation of powers doctrine, among other reasons. They are asking the court to declare the funding freeze unlawful and block any attempts to withhold or delay the funding to the states involved in the lawsuit. So far, the attorneys general have filed several lawsuits against the Trump administration concerning federal funding and have been largely successful in the early steps. “When courts make orders in our cases, we are broadly prevailing,” said California AG Rob Banta, adding that they have normally won temporary restraining orders or preliminary injunctions at this point in the litigation. Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said that they decide to sue when the answer to three main questions—has the president broken the law, have Americans been harmed and do the AGs have the legal standing to bring an action against the administration—is yes. “This was not a decision that we really had to wrestle with. In fact, it was very simple, very simple, easy decision to make to bring this lawsuit: plainly, the President has again broken the law,” said Neronha. “Frankly, we're going to win. We have yet to lose one of these funding cases, because what the President is doing is so palpably wrong.” In June, the Supreme Court's decision on the birthright citizenship case limited the ability of lower-court judges to freeze Trump's executive actions with a tool known as a nationwide injunctions. While this decision significantly limited the power of federal judges, it is not likely to affect this lawsuit because the attorneys general are not asking for a nationwide injunction. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser said that in the multiple funding lawsuits they have made, they have been seeking funding only for the states who are pressing for relief. “We have been doing that all along, because we recognize that where the nature of the relief lends itself to only the states who are suing, we ask for relief in that form: Colorado gets the share that were promised, California, etc,” Weiser said. “In short, the recent Supreme Court case didn't really bear on our decision here.”"

The elections panel's unanimous vote confirms the preliminary outcome of the special Democratic primary, which saw North Providence Town Councilor Stefano Famiglietti triumph over his three opponents with a decisive 68% percent of the vote — more than 52 percentage points ahead of second-place finisher, Marcia Ranglin-Vassell. Considered the frontrunner in the primary, Famiglietti served on the North Providence Town Council since 2018, receiving endorsements from the Senate District 4 Democratic Committee, the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone. He will now face the sole Republican candidate, Alexander Asermely, in an Aug. 5 general election. Asermely, 39, a lawyer, is a first-time candidate for elected office and is backed by the Rhode Island Republican Party. The special election fills the seat left open by Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, who died in April. Whoever wins the upcoming Aug. 5 general election will serve the rest of Ruggerio's two-year term, through 2026, with a $19,817 annual salary. There are 22,214 registered voters in the district, which spans North Providence and a section of northern Providence. A majority of them, roughly 10,000, are registered Democrats, while another 9,700 are unaffiliated, with the remainder registered as Republicans, according to data from the Rhode Island Department of State. Registered Republicans had to disaffiliate in order to vote in the July 8 Democratic primary under state election rules. Just over half of the 2,445 voters who participated in the primary cast ballots on primary day at one of four designated polling places. The other half were divided equally between early voting at city or town hall, and mail ballots. Ranglin-Vassell, a former state representative and Providence Public Schools teacher, received more than 15% of the vote overall, but more than half of the support from voters at the sole Providence polling place. Famiglietti, 33, a lawyer,  led in all three North Providence polling places with 60-80% of the votes, according to official election results. Lenny Cioe, 66, a nurse, finished third with 11.5% of votes. Manny Taveras, 40, brother of former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, received less than 5% of votes. More in U.S. Early voting for the special general election starts Wednesday and runs through Monday, Aug. 4, with weekday hours for district voters at Providence City Hall and North Providence Town Hall.

The police have witness statements from the hospital staff saying the mother(my friend) told them that's how she found the baby under him, he admitted to the police he was drinking, his 5 year old was home and told the police he was on the baby and tried to wake him but was told to go away because he was so drunk. They found many bottles of lq in their house and trash. They have testimony from many people saying the BD is a drunk, does drugs, has unregistered guns, abuses my friend, etc. after everything my friend went back on her word and told the police he was never on the kid making her look bad and like a suspect now. She does have an alibi though so it's more for messing with the investigation, lying, and neglect. All I'm saying is why has it been months and there is no arrest when he admitted to the police that night he was drinking. Idk the legal system but I feel they arrest people for wayyyy less."

mov_40D4C2F836A982DDD93558BF7893378C,2025-07-14 22:18:16,en,WEB,"  Nearly 5 million people visited the Grand Canyon last year, from day trippers and campers to people sleeping overnight in historic lodges and cabins. This year will be different, at least for one portion of the park. A wildfire has torn through a historic lodge and ended the season for the canyon's North Rim, a place where visitors could find less bustle in one of the country's most iconic national parks. As firefighters continue to fight the blaze, here's what to know about Grand Canyon National Park. Bigger than Rhode Island The Colorado River cuts through Grand Canyon National Park for about 278 miles (447 kilometers), pushing across northwestern Arizona. The eastern boundary is near the state's northern border with Utah, while the western edge is near Nevada. Grand Canyon National Park is about 1,900 square miles (nearly 5,000 square kilometers), according to the National Park Service, which makes it bigger than Rhode Island. The park is unique because of its canyon walls, which boast horizontal layers of red, orange and purple rock. The average depth of the iconic formation is about a mile (1.6 kilometers), while the average width is about 10 miles (16 kilometers). “Four Empire State Buildings stacked one atop the other would not reach the rim,” Lance Newman wrote in the introduction to the 2011 book, “The Grand Canyon Reader.” The north and south rims Within the park are the north and south rims, which are the primary travel destinations because of their accessibility. More in U.S. The North Rim receives 10% of park visitors and is known for more quiet and solitude, according to the park service. It's open from mid-May to mid-October because of the snow. But the wildfires have closed it for the rest of the season, destroying a historic lodge and dozens of cabins. The South Rim is open all year. It's more bustling and boasts a historic district, which dates to when the first steam-powered train arrived in 1901. A car trip between the rims takes five hours, according to the park service. That's because there's only one way across the Colorado River by vehicle, and its 137 miles (231 kilometers) from the South Rim Village. Hiking between rims is a shorter distance, 21 miles (34 kilometers), though by no means easy. It includes crossing the river on a narrow foot bridge 70 feet (21 meters) above the water. Unexplored by Europeans for 235 years The Grand Canyon was formed with the shifting of tectonic plates, which lifted layers of rock into a high and relatively flat plateau, according to the park service. About 5 million to 6 million years ago, the Colorado River began to carve its way downward, slowly deepening and widening the gorge. The oldest human artifacts in the area date to about 12,000 years ago, when small bands of people hunted bison, the park service said. There were gradual shifts to agriculture, the building of pueblos and the development of trade routes. Today, 11 tribes have historic connections to the canyon, including the Hopi and the Diné (Navajo). The Spanish were the first Europeans to the see the Grand Canyon in 1540, according to the park service. Francisco Vázquez de Coronado and his Spanish army were searching for fabled cities of gold. “The Hopi were able to fool the Spaniards into thinking that the area was an impenetrable wasteland and was not navigable anyway,” the park service wrote on its website, adding that the canyon “was left unexplored by Europeans for 235 years.” In the late 1850s, an Army lieutenant explored the Grand Canyon in search of a viable trade route, the park service said. Joseph Christmas Ives described it as “altogether valueless"" and predicted it “shall be forever unvisited.” The Grand Canyon began to draw much more interest after expeditions in 1869 and 1871 by geologist John Wesley Powell. Powell described rock layers in the canyon's towering walls: ""creamy orange above, then bright vermilion, and below, purple and chocolate beds, with green and yellow sands.” 'You cannot improve on it' As the years went on, more explorers arrived by boat, on foot and on horseback, often with the help of Native American guides. Wealthy travelers came by stagecoach from Flagstaff to the South Rim in the 1880s. After the arrival of trains, the automobile became the more popular mode of travel in the 1930s. Early entrepreneurs charged $1 to hike down the Bright Angel Trail used by the Havasupai people whose current-day reservation lies in the depths of the Grand Canyon. President Woodrow Wilson signed legislation to create the park in 1919 but Teddy Roosevelt is credited for its early preservation as a game reserve and a national monument. He famously said: “Leave it as it is. You cannot improve on it. The ages have been at work on it, and man can only mar it.”"

Many employees who were supposed to be released during the agency's first round of 10,000 layoffs in April have been in limbo as the effort made its way through the court system and was paused by federal judges. The reorganization, in addition to cutting staff, was supposed to consolidate the department's 28 divisions into 15 and cut regional offices from 10 to five. “Given the Supreme Court's ruling, HHS is now permitted to move forward with a portion” of its reduction in force, according to an email some employees received around 5 p.m. from the HHS Office of Human Resources. “Accordingly you are hereby notified that you are officially separated from HHS at the close of business on July 14, 2025.” Read More: Supreme Court Lets Trump Continue Education Department Layoffs It was unclear how many employees had received the emails, or their departments.

mov_BAF14A27F6FFD6278C43743A9B5241B4,2025-07-14 22:31:27,en,WEB,"  Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, California Attorney General Rob Bonta and Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell are seen in a July 14, 2025, Zoom meeting on the lawsuit they're co-leading with 20 other states against the Trump administration's decision to freeze $6.8 billion in federal education grants. (Screencap) Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha joined 23 states and the District of Columbia Monday in filing suit against President Donald Trump's administration over $6.8 billion in unexpectedly frozen funds for education initiatives like summer programming and adult learning. The lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Management and Budget and President Donald Trump. The complaint is the first legal response to a June 30 email memo sent from the U.S. Department of Education to education departments nationwide detailing the abrupt suspension of billions in federal education grants. A quarter of the grant money typically arrives in state education coffers on July 1, the start of a new fiscal year, so local education departments can plan for the year ahead. But the expected payments were paused on June 30, the last day of fiscal year 2025. The maneuver's timing leaves state-level education officials in precarious positions as they plan for the year ahead, Neronha suggested during a virtual press conference Monday with the Attorneys General of California, Colorado, and Massachusetts, who co-lead the lawsuit. “It is impossible for states to effectively budget for an upcoming school year…when the president takes the football away from us like Lucy in a Charlie Brown cartoon,” Neronha said. The funds supported after-school and summertime programming for kids, as well as adult education, and teacher training. In states like Massachusetts, the grants also subsidized education for children of migrant workers. Rhode Island would lose an estimated $29 million in federal funds. Across New England, Massachusetts would see a loss of over $100 million, and Connecticut would receive $50 million less. Vermont and Maine would lose $25 million each. New Hampshire, which would also see a $25 million loss of grant funding, is the only New England state not listed as a plaintiff in the suit. R.I. leaders are planning their next move after feds withhold $30M in K-12 funding The grants now depend on a review meant to ascertain whether “taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,” according to the three-sentence email from the education department sentJune 30. The U.S. Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. A July 9 statement Office of Management and Budget  shared with Rhode Island Current noted that the funds were paused after some school districts had allegedly used previous grant money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda.” The attorneys general argue that the funding freeze violates an assortment of federal laws and constitutional principles — both recurring themes in the arguments they made in dozens of similar multi-state lawsuits brought to court since Trump took office in January. California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who hosted the press conference, described the lawsuit as the latest defensive move against what he called the Trump administration's “little regard for the law.” “In fact, out of the 31 lawsuits I and many of my colleagues have now filed against the Trump administration in the last 25 weeks, eight of them challenge unlawful attacks on education,” Bonta said. The coalition of attorneys general wants a federal judge to rule that the funding freeze is illegal, as well as order the federal government to release the money. A pair of court filings seeking both outcomes comprises over 180 pages, and describe the freeze as “contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and unconstitutional.” Neronha told reporters that, in Rhode Island's case, the funding freeze comes at an especially inopportune time, with the state's part-time legislature having just wrapped up its legislative session three weeks prior. “It was a very difficult budget year,” Neronha said, with lawmakers forced to make tough fiscal decisions amid the state's many money troubles, including an ailing health care infrastructure. But the AG said he hoped that the issue would be resolved “far, far, far before” legislators return for a new legislative session in January. Rhode Island Department of Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green previously denounced the funding freeze at a July 9 press conference. In a Monday statement, Infante-Green again decried the funding stoppage as one that “harms Rhode Island's students, families, and teachers.” The $29 million loss of Congressionally approved aid means “there will be cuts” to before- and after-school programs, STEM learning, multilingual education, and professional development for teachers, Infante-Green said. “Rhode Island students have been making significant strides in education progress, post-pandemic,” Infante-Green wrote in her statement. “Delays and cuts in federal funds put progress and momentum in every district in Rhode Island at risk. RIDE is working closely with education leaders across the state, and across the country, doing everything we can to protect our students and limit disruptions to their learning. “ Taking legal action against the Trump administration is now routine for Neronha's office. His office's  website has tallied its salvoes against the Trump administration since March 13. Thus far, Neronha has co-led or joined 26 lawsuits against the Trump administration. Asked by reporters about the likelihood of success in the present funding case, Neronha declined to predict an outcome. “I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and I don't obviously want to speak for the court,” he said. “We have to make our points there as well. But based on the track record…we've seen this story before. We've been in the ring before with these sorts of cases and we've had great success because the violations of the law are so obvious.” GET THE MORNING HEADLINES. SUBSCRIBE"

A descendant of French settlers, Claire McCullough is looking into the past to find out how common French was spoken in the area. Although McCullough has actually never lived on the Mississippi Gulf Coast, her connection runs deep. Her family tree includes many common names in the area like Dedeaux, Saucier, Ladner, Lanez and Dubuisson. “My grandmother was a Necaise; she has a direct relation to the Necaise brothers who came here in the 18th century,” McCullough said. “We've [my family] been here in this area for at least the last 300 years.” A part of her family history is the French dialect. “Even though French isn't spoken in this area, it's still a part of the colonial history of Coastal Mississippi,” McCullough said. “Just like our Cajun cousins want to keep their history alive and let it thrive, I want to do the same.” McCullough is studying French at the University of Rhode Island, and she is researching the language spoken by her ancestors. “I want to connect with people who may have memories of French being spoken in their home,” McCullough said. “People in this area have told me that their parents and grandparents would tell them 'fais do-do', which means go to sleep, or you need to lay on your 'pallet'. Just little phrases that stayed within the community, even though their older relatives might speak to them mostly in English.” To keep this research going, McCullough is asking for help. “I'm reaching out to anyone who has memories, recordings, writings of Mississippi French being spoken in their home. I'm interviewing people about when they heard French being spoken, what context it was being used in. Anything, even the smallest phrase like wē or no' would be very useful to me.” Through this project, McCullough said she feels a bond created with past generations of her family. “My grandmother never learned to speak this French dialect; her older brothers and sisters did, so I feel like I can carry on part of her family legacy by doing this.” Not only is she carrying on her family's legacy, but McCullough also hopes to preserve the history of the Coast's different languages. “It's imperative that we keep our history alive, not just for ourselves, but to honor the memory of the people who came before us.” If you have something you'd like to pass along about French being spoken in South Mississippi, or you're looking for more information, visit McCullough's website.

In an email obtained by Federal News Network, HHS told employees that the Supreme Court's ruling on July 8 allows the department to proceed with “a portion” of its reduction-in-force plans. “Accordingly, you are hereby notified that you are officially separated from HHS at the close of business on July 14, 2025,” the email states. “Thank you for your service to the American people.” HHS sent RIF notices to 10,000 employees on April 1. Another 10,000 employees left by accepting voluntary separation incentives. Altogether, the department will shed about 25% of its employees. An HHS spokesperson told Bloomberg that all employees who received RIF notices on April 1 have been officially separated from the agency, except a narrow group of employees covered by a preliminary injunction issued by a federal judge in Rhode Island. That injuction, issued by District Court Judge Melissa DuBose on July 1,  covers employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration's tobacco center, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and the Office of Head Start. HHS is the third agency to advance its workforce cuts following the Supreme Court's ruling. The State Department laid off over 1,350 employees on Friday. The Education Department will proceed with its plans to lay off 1,400 employees after the Supreme Court issued another ruling on Monday. Since April, HHS has reinstated employees across the department, including employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, human resources staff, and acquisition experts within the Office of the Chief Information Officer. HHS faces other legal challenges over its workforce cuts. A class-action lawsuit in the U.S. Court for the District of Columbia claims the department relied on “hopelessly error-ridden” data when it carried out the mass terminations on April 1. This is a developing story and will be updated. The post first appeared on Federal News Network ."
mov_34B83D2A3E50F800A3C745987B6560DE,2025-07-14 23:32:44,en,WEB,"  July 14th, 2025 ( Al Jazeera English  - Delivered by  Newstex ) Two dozen states have sued the administration of United States President Donald Trump after the federal government froze $6.8bn in education funding. On Monday, a group of 23 attorneys general and two governors filed a lawsuit in Rhode Island arguing that the decision to halt funds approved by the US Congress was 'contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and unconstitutional'. The freeze extended to funding used to support the education of migrant farm workers and their children, recruitment and training of teachers, English proficiency learning, academic enrichment, and after-school and summer programmes. The administration also froze funding used to support adult literacy and job-readiness skills. 'This is not about Democrat or Republican - these funds were appropriated by Congress for the education of Kentucky's children, and it's my job to ensure we get them,' Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said in a statement. 'In Kentucky, $96 million in federal education funds are at risk. Our kids and our future depend on a strong education, and these funds are essential to making sure our kids succeed.' While the government was legally required to release the money to the states by July 1, the  federal Department of Education notified states on June 30 that it would not be issuing grant awards under those programmes by that deadline. It cited the change in administration as its reason. Schools in Republican-led areas are particularly affected by the freeze in federal education grants. Ninety-one of the 100 school districts that receive the most money per student from four frozen grant programmes are in Republican congressional districts, according to an analysis from New America, a left-leaning think tank. New America's analysis used funding levels reported in 2022 in 46 states. Republican officials have been among the educators criticising the grant freeze. 'I deeply believe in fiscal responsibility, which means evaluating the use of funds and seeking out efficiencies, but also means being responsible - releasing funds already approved by Congress and signed by President Trump,' said Georgia schools superintendent Richard Woods, an elected Republican. 'In Georgia, we're getting ready to start the school year, so I call on federal funds to be released so we can ensure the success of our students.' The Office of Management and Budget said the pause is part of a review to ensure funds are not used to 'subsidize a radical leftwing agenda'. Link to the original story."

mov_CBFFAE75CC9734275C472843F735DB6B,2025-07-15 00:47:52,en,WEB,"  MICHIGAN (WLUC) - On Monday, Attorney General Dana Nessel (D-Michigan) joined a coalition of 22 states in suing the Trump Administration. The lawsuit addresses what Nessel is calling the administration's “unconstitutional, unlawful and arbitrary decision to freeze funding for six longstanding programs administered by the U.S. Department of Education.” In a video, Nessel says without funding, many educational programs will shutter, and “already, ongoing summer learning programs have been left unfunded.” In the lawsuit, the attorneys general say “the funding freeze violates the federal funding statutes and regulations authorizing these critical programs and appropriating funds for them, violates federal statutes governing the federal budgeting process, including the Antideficiency Act and Impoundment Control Act, and violates the constitutional separation of powers doctrine and the Presentment Clause. They ask the court for declaratory and injunctive relief.” “Courts across the country have made it clear to Donald Trump that he and his administration do not have the authority to unilaterally block funding that Congress has already approved,” Nessel said. “These education grants are designed to help Michigan students thrive. By freezing them, the Trump White House is not just breaking the law but jeopardizing our kids' future. Just as I have before, I will stand with my colleagues to protect the resources our students deserve.” Nessel says the freeze affects six programs in Michigan, totaling approximately $171 million. Impacted programs are administered through the Michigan Department of Education , Lifelong Education, Advancement, and Potential, and the Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity. Those include: Title I-C – Education of Migratory Children, which supports the educational needs of students whose families frequently move for seasonal agricultural or fishing work. Title II-A – Supporting Effective Instruction, which provides supplemental funding to help local education agencies (LEAs) implement professional development leadership initiatives that strengthen teaching and improve student academic achievement. Title III-A – English Language Acquisition, Language Enhancement, and Academic Achievement, which supports English learners and enhances multilingual education services. Title IV-A – Student Support and Academic Enrichment Grants, which aims to improve student achievement by increasing the capacity of states, LEAs, schools, and local communities to offer students a well-rounded education, improve school conditions for learning, and improve the use of technology to boost academic achievement and digital literacy. Title IV-B – 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which offers out-of-school academic support, enrichment, youth development, and family engagement for K-12 students. Adult Basic Literacy, Integrated English Literacy, and Civics Education Grants, which ensure adult education providers can support learners in developing basic reading, writing, mathematics, and English language skills. Programs also help adults receive a high school completion or equivalency and gain the workforce skills needed for employment. In the lawsuit, Nessel and a coalition say “the Trump Administration's actions violate federal funding statutes and the Appropriations Act, Antideficiency Act, Administrative Procedures Act, and U.S. Constitution. That includes the separation of powers doctrine, equitable ultra vires, and the Presentment Clause.” The attorneys general asked the court to declare the funding freeze unlawful and block any attempts to withhold or delay this funding. Nessel joins the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawai'i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, as well as the states of Kentucky and Pennsylvania.

Encabezada por California, la querella legal argumenta que la Administración Trump ha violado la Constitución y varias leyes federales al suspender 6 mil millones de dólares en fondos asignados a los programas extraescolares, que incluyen clases de inglés para inmigrantes, entre otros. El gobierno ordenó la retención de recursos que el Departamento de Educación (DOE, en inglés) suele poner a disposición de los estados hacia el 1 de julio para que las agencias educativas estatales y locales puedan planificar sus presupuestos para el próximo año académico.

Sin embargo, este año, el 30 de junio, las agencias estatales de todo el país recibieron una notificación anunciando que no se distribuirían estos recursos. “Sin ton ni son, la Administración Trump congeló abruptamente miles de millones de dólares en fondos para la educación apenas unas semanas antes del inicio del año escolar”, dijo el fiscal de California, Rob Bonta, en un comunicado.

California es uno de los estados más afectados con la retención de más de 900 millones de dólares en fondos. El presidente Donald Trump “parece dispuesto a arriesgar el éxito académico de una generación para impulsar su propia agenda política desacertada. Pero, como ocurre con tantas otras de sus acciones, esta congelación de fondos es manifiestamente ilegal, y confiamos en que el tribunal estará de acuerdo”, subrayó Bonta.

mov_D288EE6C3419535506BF8144CFE075BA,2025-07-15 01:53:51,en,WEB,"  Abstract painter Edwin Wilwayco is clear on one thing: “I'm more daring, my style has changed—but my soul is still there.” “Edwin Wilwayco NOW,” his current exhibit at the Galerie Joaquin Rockwell, captures a master challenging the very language he helped define in Philippine abstraction. His works paint an artist unafraid to continue exploring and reimagining. “My exhibit is a mini retrospective of, you may call them, never-before-seen works from four series I mounted from 2023 to the present: Jeepney Unicus, Bellavia, Rhapsody In Abstraction and Soundscapes In Shape. Of course, my love for music inspired them all,” says Wilwayco, whose house boasts not only of paintings in every nook, cranny and corner, but also a trove of time-honored CDs (and hidden in a secret corner room, his collection of shoes!) . “Rhythmic inspiration lies at the core of these creations on exhibit. The movement of the strokes is palpable, like in a composition. I find in each piece smooth, intersecting curves, undulating, sinewy lines that impart complexity. The strokes are melodious, but controlled,” says Wilwayco, who doesn't consign his paintings. The reason he has never-before-seen works is because he doesn't exhibit what he doesn't perceive—as yet—to be a perfect visual melody. “I have kept these paintings in my studio, refining, editing,” Wilwayco, who shuttles between Providence, Rhode Island and Manila, points out. Refreshed and reinvigorated and eager to share his never-before-seen pieces from four different series from 2023 to 2025, Wilwayco continues to push the limits of mastery and visual resonance with each canvas as he continues to create a world of motion and rhythm. From his last exhibit at Galerie Joaquin Podium in December 2023, Octo Gravitas 2, Wilwayco's unmistakable signature is still ever apparent in this new collection through a symphony of bold, layered colors and masterful strokes. Yet, each piece showcases a renewed vitality, even sharper contrast. His Rhapsody in Abstraction series presents a euphoric interplay of cool hues, softened and punctuated by slashes of white and sparks of lighter colors. Bellavia, on the other hand, features explosive compositions rendered in combinations of red, white, gray and black. In contrast to his other abstractions, Bellavia surges with controlled strength and dynamism. Each canvas is inscribed with movement and emotional tension. The third series, Soundscapes in Shape, is music—rhythm and movement—in physical form. Lastly, Wilwayco revisits his Jeepney series (1989 and 2018) via Jeepney Unicus. Here, he not only reminisces about scenes of jeepneys in motion and street scenes through flashbacks of memory but also experiments with velocity abstracted into colors and lines. In these series, Wilwayco looks back on not only where he has been, but more importantly, where he is now. Born in Guimba, Nueva Ecija, he has earned his way into local and international success, elevating the respect of many artists and art-savants then and now. And to think that in 1979, a dejected Wilwayco, then an art director in an advertising agency, wanted to quit painting. Only one of his paintings from his Flag series exhibit was sold. He was newly married and broke. But he was admonished by painter, art critic and historian Dr. Rod Paras Perez over coffee at Dulcinea—yes, he remembers! —to use the lull to apply for scholarships, which he got. Another three years later, six paintings from the Flag series were bought by no less than the Central Bank of the Philippines! I recently visited Wilwayco's studio—the entrance of which is a huge red door, for “statement,” he explains—and beheld a commissioned triptych he is working on. I see in the soon-to-be-finished triptych more vibrant hues and splashes of color—a very danceable melody if likened to a musical composition. Each painting in the triptych measures 7.5 by 6.5 ft, or 7.5 by 19.5 ft. when combined. Wilwayco has to ascend a ladder to compose this artwork. “This triptych is called Whispering Winds,” he reveals. I point out that the strokes are so bold and vibrant, they don't look like whispers. “That's the irony,” he laughs. Loud strokes can be a whisper if you choose them to be, he elaborates. “I imagine this to be a forest in the Amazon, where even gentle winds bring vivid colors.” “I don't want to evoke the habagat, so I chose the winds to be a whisper,” he continues, referencing the habagat season (June to October) in the Philippines, which brings heavy rainfall. Symbolically, habagat also means the more turbulent season compared to the whispering winds of the amihan season, which is calmer. “I don't want my art to be predictable, or polished,” says Wilwayco, who was a scholar of the British Council in 1982, training under the curriculum of West Surrey College of Art and Design. In that same year, Wilwayco was also granted by the Italian government another scholarship for painting. Looking at his triptych, I ask what he sees. “I like colors.

In an email obtained by Federal News Network, HHS told employees that the Supreme Court's ruling on July 8 allows the department to proceed with “a portion” of its reduction-in-force plans. “Accordingly, you are hereby notified that you are officially separated from HHS at the close of business on July 14, 2025,” the email states. “Thank you for your service to the American people.” HHS sent RIF notices to 10,000 employees on April 1. Another 10,000 employees left by accepting voluntary separation incentives. Altogether, the department will shed about 25% of its employees. An HHS spokesperson told Federal News Network that all employees who received RIF notices on April 1 have been officially separated from the agency, except a narrow group of employees covered by a preliminary injunction issued by a federal judge in Rhode Island, and those who have been reinstated in recent months. That injuction, issued by District Court Judge Melissa DuBose on July 1,  covers employees at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration's tobacco center, the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and Evaluation and the Office of Head Start. Since April, HHS has reinstated employees across the department, including employees at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, human resources staff, and acquisition experts within the Office of the Chief Information Officer. HHS faces other legal challenges over its workforce cuts. A class-action lawsuit in the U.S. Court for the District of Columbia claims the department relied on “hopelessly error-ridden” data when it carried out the mass terminations on April 1. HHS is the third agency to advance its workforce cuts following the Supreme Court's ruling. The State Department laid off over 1,350 employees on Friday. The Education Department will proceed with its plans to lay off 1,400 employees after the Supreme Court issued another ruling on Monday. This is a developing story and will be updated.

mov_BE1056108EA1CB992214A52EF0EBFED8,2025-07-15 03:34:56,en,WEB,"  At a Glance Rhode Island law bans mandatory employer-sponsored meetings on “political” matters, which includes an employer's position on unionization. The new law creates a private right of action for aggrieved employees. On July 2, 2025, Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee signed into law House Bill No. 5506 SUB A. With the stroke of a pen, Rhode Island joined the growing list of states to ban mandatory employer-sponsored meetings regarding religious and “political matters.” The New Law Based on its seemingly innocuous title, the new Section 28-7-50 of the Rhode Island General Laws is intended to promote and protect “[e]mployee rights of free speech in the workplace.” However, a closer reading of the new law's definitions section reveals its true purpose: to impose a sweeping—and likely unconstitutional—ban on “captive audience” meetings. The law defines “political matters” as “topics that are unrelated to the employer's business or business activities, such as subjects relating to elections for political office, political parties, [and] proposals to change legislation or regulations which are not directly related to the employer's business[.]” However, tacked on to the tail end of the definition of “political matters” is the following language: “a decision whether to join or support any political party, or political, civic, community, fraternal, or labor organization.” (Emphasis added) Effective July 2, 2025, Rhode Island employers are prohibited from discharging, disciplining, penalizing (or threatening to discharge, discipline, or penalize) or otherwise taking any adverse employment action against an employee because they refused to attend a mandatory employer-sponsored meeting to learn about the employer's views and opinions concerning whether employees should join or support a labor union. In addition, the law goes beyond a mere prohibition on “captive audience” meetings to prohibit employers from taking adverse action against an employee for refusing to listen to a speech or view a communication, including an electronic communication, from the employer regarding the employer's opinions on unionization. Aggrieved employees who believe that they have been discharged, disciplined, penalized, or otherwise subjected to an adverse employment action for refusing to subject themselves to the employer's views and opinions on “political matters” will now have a private right of action to sue their current or former employer. The court may award a prevailing plaintiff “all appropriate relief,” including injunctive relief, back pay, reestablishment of employee benefits (including seniority) to which the employee would have been entitled had the violation not occurred, and monetary damages. Additionally, prevailing plaintiffs will be entitled to attorney's fees and costs. The New Law's Preemption Problem Section 28-7-50 appears to be a solution in search of a problem. On November 13, 2024, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued its landmark decision in Amazon.com Services, LLC, ruling that an employer violates the federal National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by requiring employees, under the threat of discipline or discharge, to attend employer-sponsored meetings for the employer to express its views on unionization. In doing so, the NLRB overruled 76-year-old precedent that recognized the free speech rights of employers to hold such meetings. Many keen observers of the NLRB expect the Board, once it regains the quorum of three members required to conduct business, to revisit this decision in an appropriate case and overrule it. The NLRA preempts state laws that conflict with its provisions or attempt to regulate areas already covered by the NLRA. This principle is rooted in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which establishes that federal law takes precedence over conflicting state laws. Specifically, the NLRA preempts state laws that regulate union organizing, collective bargaining, and unfair labor practices, as the NLRA exclusively governs these areas of labor relations. Accordingly, state-level efforts, such as Section 28-7-50 to ban captive audience meetings, are likely preempted by the NLRA, meaning that the NLRB's ban on captive audience meetings is controlling and state level regulation in this area is unconstitutional. The New Law Will Have a Chilling Effect on Employer Free Speech Rights In addition to federal preemption issues, Section 28-7-50 will have a serious chilling effect on employers seeking to hold voluntary meetings with their employees to discuss whether to join or support a union. Prior to the NLRB's November 2024 ruling in Amazon.com Services, LLC, Rhode Island employers held workplace meetings for a wide variety of legitimate purposes: Expressing the Employer's Views and Opinions on Unionization: Employers held “captive audience” meetings to explain their views and opinions on unions, emphasizing why they believed unionization would not be in the best interests of the company or its employees. These meetings often highlighted the employer's preference for maintaining open, honest, and direct communication with employees without the involvement of an unnecessary third-party intermediary, such as a union. Educating Employees About Unionization: Many employees are often unaware of the implications of unionization, including the potential costs associated with union membership (such as union dues and initiation fees) as well as the challenges of the collective bargaining process. “Captive audience” meetings were held to address common misconceptions about unionization, employee rights, and employer obligations under the NLRA. Addressing Employee Concerns: “Captive audience” meetings provided a valuable opportunity for employers to address specific questions or concerns that employees had about the terms and conditions of their employment and the impacts that unionization would have on those terms and conditions. Highlighting Existing Employee Benefits: Employers used “captive audience” meetings to remind employees of the valuable employee benefits they already received, such as paid leave, health insurance, and other perks. They also used these meetings to emphasize that employee benefits were not guaranteed to improve or change through collective bargaining. Countering Union Misinformation Campaigns: Employers used “captive audience” meetings to respond to false, misleading, and inaccurate information shared during unionization campaigns, pointing out that unions can make lofty promises during organizing efforts but cannot guarantee outcomes without the employer's agreement through collective bargaining. Section 28-7-50 establishes a new private right of action for current and former employees who feel they have been ""penalized"" for refusing to attend voluntary informational meetings, listen to speeches about joining or supporting a labor organization, or read electronic communications from their employers regarding unionization. This law may restrict employers' ability to express themselves freely in the workplace. If employers believe that they can only share information that is legally required or necessary for employees to perform their job duties, they could find themselves at a significant disadvantage when facing a rapidly developing unionization campaign."

mov_C279B7854A55FEC9A68518A4C7B79F5B,2025-07-15 05:50:22,en,WEB,"  Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought, center, and Education Secretary Linda McMahon are targets of the states' lawsuit over the administration's decision to freeze $6.8 billion in schools funds at the last minute. (Photo by Andrew Harnik/) Maryland joined 23 other states and the District of Columbia Monday in a lawsuit against the Trump administration, two weeks after the U.S. Department of Education abruptly froze $6.8 billion in funds for summer programs, adult learning and more. The lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the Education Department, the Office of Management and Budget and President Donald Trump. It was sparked by a three-sentence June 30 email to states that said previously approved federal funds, due to be released the next day, were instead being held for review to ensure that they align with “the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities.” The attorneys general argue that the funding freeze violates an assortment of federal laws and constitutional principles — both recurring themes in the arguments they made in dozens of similar multistate lawsuits brought to court since Trump took office in January. They also say it comes at the worst possible time for school systems. “This reckless funding freeze is directly harming Maryland's students by taking more than $110 million from Maryland K–12 schools and adult education programs, which has jeopardized teacher training, thrown essential special needs services into chaos, and left families scrambling to find child care before the start of a new school year,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement on the suit. “Maryland's students are not pawns in political games over government spending — they need and deserve the educational resources that the Trump administration is threatening to cancel,” Brown said. A quarter of the grant money typically arrives in state education coffers on July 1, the start of a new fiscal year, so local education departments can plan for the year ahead. But the expected payments were paused on June 30, the last day of fiscal 2025. The timing leaves state-level education officials in precarious positions as they plan for the year ahead, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said during a virtual news conference Monday with the attorneys general of California, Colorado, and ksuit. “It is impossible for states to effectively budget for an upcoming school year … when the president takes the football away from us like Lucy in a Charlie Brown cartoon,” Neronha said. The funds supported after-school and summertime programming for kids, as well as adult education, and teacher training. It also funded education for English-language learners and subsidized education for children of migrant workers. Other states on the lawsuit are Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, along with the District of Columbia. The U.S. Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. A July 9 statement from the Office of Management and Budget  shared with Rhode Island Current noted that the funds were paused after some school districts had allegedly used previous grant money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda.” California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who hosted Monday's news conference, described the lawsuit as the latest defensive move against what he called the Trump administration's “little regard for the law.” “In fact, out of the 31 lawsuits I and many of my colleagues have now filed against the Trump administration in the last 25 weeks, eight of them challenge unlawful attacks on education,” Bonta said. The coalition of attorneys general wants a federal judge to rule that the funding freeze is illegal, as well as order the federal government to release the money. A pair of  court filings seeking both outcomes comprises over 180 pages, and describe the freeze as “contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and unconstitutional.” Neronha told reporters that, in Rhode Island's case, the funding freeze comes at an especially inopportune time, with the state's part-time legislature having just wrapped up its legislative session three weeks prior. “It was a very difficult budget year,” Neronha said, with lawmakers forced to make tough fiscal decisions amid the state's many money troubles, including an ailing health care infrastructure. But Neronha said he hoped that the issue would be resolved “far, far, far before” legislators return for a new legislative session in January. Rhode Island Department of Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green, who  denounced the funding freeze at a July 9 news conference, said Monday that the funding freeze “harms Rhode Island's students, families, and teachers.” The loss of $29 million in congressionally approved aid means “there will be cuts” to before- and after-school programs, STEM learning, multilingual education, and professional development for teachers, Infante-Green said. “Rhode Island students have been making significant strides in education progress, post-pandemic,” Infante-Green wrote in her statement. “Delays and cuts in federal funds put progress and momentum in every district in Rhode Island at risk.” Taking legal action against the Trump administration is now routine for Democratic attorneys general. Neronha's office has co-led or joined   26 lawsuits against the Trump administration since March. Maryland also has a hand in 26 suits, according to Brown's office . Asked by reporters about the likelihood of success in the present funding case, Neronha declined to predict an outcome. “I don't want to get ahead of ourselves and I don't obviously want to speak for the court,” he said. “We have to make our points there as well. But based on the track record … we've seen this story before. We've been in the ring before with these sorts of cases and we've had great success because the violations of the law are so obvious.” – Thi story originally appeared in Rhode Island Current , which is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

A coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Monday over $6.8 billion in education funding that the administration has withheld a few weeks before the start of the school year. The withheld money includes about 14 percent of all federal funding for elementary and secondary education across the country. It helps pay for free or low-cost after-school programs that give students a place to go while their parents work. It also covers training to improve the effectiveness of teachers and help for children learning English. Attorneys general from 22 states signed onto the lawsuit, along with the governors of Pennsylvania and Kentucky. All are Democrats. The lawsuit accuses the Trump administration of holding back the money illegally. The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power of the purse, and the Impoundment Control Act of 1974 says that a president cannot unilaterally refuse to spend money that Congress has appropriated. The lawsuit asks a federal judge in Rhode Island to order the release of the money, which was supposed to be sent to states on July 1. The Department of Education notified state education agencies on June 30 that it was holding the money back while it conducted a review. The Trump administration has sought to slash federal spending and align the budget with the president's political priorities. A spokesman for the White House Office of Management and Budget said that an initial review found instances of federal education money being ''grossly misused to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda.'' Among the examples he cited was a seminar on ''queer resistance in the arts.'' The White House did not respond immediately to a request for comment about the lawsuit. The White House has not said when the money might be released. It has proposed eliminating dedicated funding for the programs in its 2026 budget, ending some of the programs outright and collapsing others into a smaller pot of education funding for states. President Trump and his team have said they believe the Impoundment Control Act is unconstitutional, and have argued that the president should have a greater say over spending in many areas of government. Mr. Trump has said he also wants to eliminate the Department of Education, arguing that education should be more fully controlled by the states, though only Congress can abolish a cabinet-level agency. The withholding of $6.8 billion for education has been sharply criticized by a growing chorus of Democrats, as well as by some Republicans. Rep. Mike Lawler, a Republican who represents suburban areas north of New York City, urged President Trump to release $1.3 billion of the money to be used for after-school and other programs that keep children occupied outside of school hours, including in the summer. He argued in a statement that the programs fulfill the Trump administration's goal of giving power over education to the states, because state education agencies manage the money and choose which organizations receive it. Nationwide, the withheld federal money funds after-school and other services for an estimated 1.4 million children, or nearly 20 percent of all students who participate in after-school programs, according to the Afterschool Alliance, an advocacy group. Most of the students in the programs come from lower-income households, and through after-school, they typically receive academic help, enrichment and a free snack or meal. ''Work doesn't end at 3 o'clock,'' said Christy Gleason, executive director of the Save the Children Action Network, which runs after-school programs at 41 schools, mainly in rural areas. In many rural areas, the federally funded after-school programs are the only option. Cutting them would leave working parents there with few alternatives for child care, she said. The withheld money includes $2.1 billion to help train, mentor and retain effective teachers, with a focus on low-income school districts. It also includes $1.4 billion in flexible funding for schools to spend on art, music, mental health services, physical education and technology. Smaller amounts go toward helping children learning English; adult literacy and education; and support for children of migrant farmworkers. In Monterey County, Calif., about one in eight students qualify for the federal program for children of migrant farmworkers, said Deneen Guss, the county superintendent, who works with 24 local school districts. The students' parents move seasonally to harvest crops like strawberries and vegetables, education officials said. Many of them arrive in the county in March and move on again in October, creating academic and emotional challenges for students. The federal money helps pay for academic support and other needs, like helping children sign up to see a doctor or dentist. The Trump administration has proposed eliminating the program, claiming that it is ineffective and strips taxpayer money from American students. Most students in the Monterey County program are U.S. citizens or are in the country legally, Dr. Guss said. Because the money to pay them has been withheld, the county has issued a layoff notice for about 30 employees who work as family specialists, teachers' aides and in other positions, said Ernesto Vela, an assistant superintendent in the Monterey County Office of Education. ''All of the staff, if the funds do not come in, then essentially their last day of work is Sept. 7,'' he said."

With beautiful coastlines and calm, blue waters, the Ocean State is full of beaches that make for the perfect New England summer day. But which one of the state's beaches is the oldest? With roots going back to 1887, Newport's – locally known as First Beach – is the oldest public beach in Rhode Island, standing at 138 years old. AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement Here's a brief history of the state's oldest beach, as well as how to go there this summer. History of Easton's Beach According to the , Easton's Beach dates back to 1887, when architectural firm Peabody & Stearns built the original Pavilion. The beach was named after Nicholas Easton, an early settler of Newport and former colonial governor of Rhode Island. In 1902, the facilities were expanded to look like a Mediterranean Villa, complete with bath houses, restaurants, a carousel and a roller coaster. The beach soon became a popular summer destination for middle and working-class families, who could walk the boardwalk, rent cabins, ride steamboats and enjoy the amusement rides.

With beautiful coastlines and calm, blue waters, the Ocean State is full of beaches that make for the perfect New England summer day. But which one of the state's beaches is the oldest? With roots going back to 1887, Newport's Easton's Beach – locally known as First Beach – is the oldest public beach in Rhode Island, standing at 138 years old. Here's a brief history of the state's oldest beach, as well as how to go there this summer. History of Easton's Beach Easton's Beach in Newport According to the Newport Historical Society, Easton's Beach dates back to 1887, when architectural firm Peabody & Stearns built the original Pavilion. The beach was named after Nicholas Easton, an early settler of Newport and former colonial governor of Rhode Island. In 1902, the facilities were expanded to look like a Mediterranean Villa, complete with bath houses, restaurants, a carousel and a roller coaster. The beach soon became a popular summer destination for middle and working-class families, who could walk the boardwalk, rent cabins, ride steamboats and enjoy the amusement rides. Unfortunately, all of the beach's original buildings were swept away during the Hurricane of 1938. The beach has undergone lots of weather-caused destruction over the years since then, with most of the present structures only standing since 1992. In 2024, the snack bar and carousel were demolished.

mov_24CB7E7C6A0C74B32546944CEEB0A1B4,2025-07-15 11:00:01,en,WEB,"  Target's shares have plummeted and annual sales have stagnated for four years. Customers, vendors and former employees told CNBC that the discounter has lost some of the unique traits that helped it stand out, including its eye-catching merchandise, attentive staff and well-kept stores. The big-box retailer is expected to gain a new leader, too, as CEO Brian Cornell's contract winds down. Shortly before a road trip in early 2024, Mary Molina realized her view of Target had changed. Molina, a mother of five and entrepreneur who lives in Westchester, New York, said her weekly trips to Target looked and felt different from her experience before the Covid pandemic. Items such as national brands of laundry detergent or shampoo were often out of stock. She said store employees weren't as friendly as before, with heads down or eyes glued to a handheld device as they picked orders for an online shopper. And when she browsed for the cute and trendy swimsuits, pajama sets or sandals she had typically found at Target, she said it felt like ""a sea of generic."" ""It was a small evolution, and then one day, my husband said, 'Let's stop at Target and then we'll go to Rhode Island,'"" she said of preparing for the road trip. ""And I said, 'What for?'"" Molina and customers like her reflect a fading loyalty to Target that's testing its business model and slowing its sales. The retailer, which gained a loyal following over decades for its quirky, progressive and chic approach to big-box retail, now appears stuck as it tries to grow again and bounce back from lower store traffic, inventory issues and customer backlash. Shares of Target have fallen about 61% since their all-time high in late 2021. That peak came after Target's sales rose more than $15 billion in the fiscal year following the start of the Covid pandemic, but its annual revenue has stagnated for the past four years. And Target said in May that it expects sales to fall this year. Target leaders have described the weaker performance as a blip, pointing to higher inflation or other temporary factors, and expressing confidence in its long-term strategy. In May, Target said sluggish sales resulted from weaker discretionary spending, uncertainty about President Donald Trump's tariffs and backlash to its decision to roll back key diversity, equity and inclusion efforts. But customers, former employees, vendors and analysts painted a picture of a company at an existential crossroads. In interviews with CNBC, they attributed Target's struggles to the weakening of unique traits that helped the retailer stand out, including its eye-catching merchandise, attentive staff, well-kept stores and commitment to celebrating diversity through both the items that it sold and the policies it supported. Multiple former employees, who asked not to be identified because they weren't authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said Target's store standards have slipped in recent years as the company has tried to juggle online and in-store businesses with a leaner store staff — leading to items being out of stock. Customers and analysts also told CNBC they have seen longer checkout lines, messier aisles and fewer employees at stores. Plus, former employees said Target's sharp turn away from diversity efforts, along with cost cuts, hurt corporate culture and employee morale. ""They have kind of lost their identity,"" said a former employee, who worked for the company for nearly a decade but left recently to work for a competing retailer. Leadership transition The bulk of the work to turn Target around will likely fall to a new chief executive. CEO Brian Cornell is 66 years old, and in September 2022, Target said he agreed to stay in the role three more years. The company has not disclosed when that contract expires or named his successor. Investors have speculated about who will lead the company after Cornell — and what that internal or external pick may mean for the company's future. Cornell took the helm at Target in 2014, another troubled time in the company's history. He started as CEO after ex-CEO Gregg Steinhafel resigned following a data breach that compromised the personal information of as many as 110 million people — equivalent to roughly 1 in 3 Americans at the time. Target said it believes it can rebound again from its current low point, as it invests in store renovations and plans to open 300 more locations over the next 10 years. Target declined interview requests for this story, but provided a statement from Cornell, who said the company is ""built for long-term, profitable growth,"" boosted by its store fleet, growing digital business and brand partnerships. ""Backed by strong assets, proven capabilities and a talented team, we're confident in our ability to accelerate near-term performance while continuing to innovate and serve our guests—today and in the years ahead,"" he said. The company announced several key changes in May as it tries to revamp its business. Target said it was starting an Enterprise Acceleration Office to speed innovation and rev up sales. It tapped Chief Operating Officer Michael Fiddelke, a Target veteran of more than 20 years who also served as chief financial officer, to lead the new effort. He is considered a potential successor to Cornell. The announcement of the new office coincided with another shakeup. Target said two key executives would depart: Chief Growth Officer Christina Hennington, another CEO candidate discussed in industry circles, and Chief Legal and Compliance Officer Amy Tu, a retail veteran who was at Target for less than a year. 'Not as edgy as before' Through word of mouth and social media, Target's name became synonymous over the years with fashion-forward finds for less. The retailer's creative approach to merchandise — including exclusive brands and limited-time collaborations with fashion designers — sparked stories of shoppers who went to the store for one item but left with a basket full of merchandise they didn't know they wanted. The discounter's cheap chic approach inspired some customers to call the retailer ""Tarzhay,"" a nickname that evoked French high fashion. Target turned its giant stores into a mall-like experience where suburban shoppers could order a Starbucks coffee and spend hours browsing the aisles for lipsticks, throw pillows or new outfits. And it attracted time-crunched customers by making it possible to pick up a gallon of milk or box of diapers without leaving the car. At its July 2021 peak, Target's market cap catapulted to about $129 billion — after Americans sought retail therapy during the pandemic and splurged with stimulus checks and money they weren't spending on travel, dining out or other activities. Since then, the ""Tarzhay"" formula hasn't translated in the same way. Target's market cap has tumbled to about $47 billion. As a retailer known for selling discretionary items, Target has been vulnerable to high inflation and economic uncertainty. Rival Walmart is the nation's largest grocer, and only 40% of its sales come from discretionary items, compared with about half at Target, according to estimates by GlobalData Retail...."
mov_9476A89C825767E196B74162BE414528,2025-07-15 11:19:23,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]Nova música de Justin Bieber expõe fragilidades e fortalezas de seu casamento com Hailey Bieber Justin Bieber colocou suas emoções à flor da pele na recém-lançada “Daisies”, faixa de seu álbum Swag, e os fãs não demoraram a notar: a canção parece ser uma carta aberta para sua esposa, Hailey Bieber, em meio a rumores de turbulência no casamento. No single, Justin descreve com sensibilidade como lida com os períodos de afastamento do casal, especialmente quando há desentendimentos. Em versos marcados pela vulnerabilidade, ele canta: “Você me deixa no vácuo, mas eu ainda entendo a mensagem / Em vez de palavras, são só três pontinhos, mas eu conecto / E se não estiver certo, tudo bem, eu respeito”. O refrão reforça o tom de saudade e entrega emocional: “Tô contando os dias, quantos dias até te ver de novo?” A música mergulha em lembranças do início do relacionamento, sugerindo que os altos e baixos enfrentados pelos dois fazem parte de uma história maior de amor. Em um trecho direto, Bieber revela o desejo de reconexão física e emocional: “Não quero ser só amigo, quero pele com pele, chegar mais perto, mais perto, mais perto.” O conteúdo da faixa surge em meio a especulações sobre uma fase difícil na relação. No final de junho, uma fonte próxima ao casal revelou à revista Us Weekly que os dois estariam passando por um momento delicado, mas que permanecem comprometidos com o casamento: “Eles acreditam que são almas gêmeas e farão o que for preciso para fazer dar certo.” E parece que Hailey aprovou a mensagem. Pouco após o lançamento de “Daisies”, a modelo postou discretamente uma Story no Instagram ouvindo a música, sem legenda, mas deixando claro que escutou — e talvez tenha sentido. Desde o início do relacionamento, marcado por uma reconexão em 2018 após anos afastados, Justin e Hailey têm sido francos sobre os desafios da vida a dois. Em entrevista antiga à Elle, Hailey comentou sobre como se reaproximaram após um tempo separados: “Parecia território familiar, mas depois de tanto tempo, era como conhecer uma nova pessoa.” Justin Bieber surpreendeu o mundo ao lançar SWAG, seu sétimo álbum de estúdio. Sem anúncio oficial prévio, o projeto chegou às plataformas digitais após uma série de ações misteriosas em outdoors e publicações nas redes sociais — estratégias que já vinham despertando curiosidade entre os fãs nos últimos dias. Embora a imprensa internacional já especulasse a chegada do novo disco, incluindo uma reportagem do The Hollywood Reporter, a confirmação só veio poucas horas antes do lançamento. Antes disso, fãs atentos já haviam flagrado a divulgação do álbum em cidades como Reykjavik, na Islândia, e Los Angeles, nos Estados Unidos. Com 21 faixas no total, SWAG marca o retorno de Justin Bieber após um hiato de quatro anos desde Justice (2021). O novo trabalho é descrito pela Def Jam Recordings como “uma obra moldada por sua jornada como marido e pai, oferecendo composições mais íntimas e introspectivas”. Entre os destaques, estão colaborações com nomes como Gunna, Druski, Dijon, Lil B, Sexyy Red e Marvin Winans. Confira a tracklist de SWAG de Justin Bieber: All I Can Take Daisies Yukon Go Baby Things You Do Butterflies Way It Is (com Gunna) First Place Soulful (com Druski) Walking Away Glory Voice Memo Devotion (com Dijon) Dadz Love (com Lil B) Therapy Session (com Druski) Sweet Spot (com Sexyy Red) Standing On Business (com Druski) 405 Swag (com Cash Cobain e Eddie Benjamin) Zuma House Too Long Forgiveness (interpretada por Marvin Winans) Com uma estética visual renovada, Bieber adotou o nome “lil bieber” em seus perfis nas redes e publicou imagens inéditas ao lado da esposa, Hailey Bieber, e do filho do casal, Jack Blues Bieber, nascido em agosto de 2024. As fotos reforçam a narrativa de uma nova fase mais madura — tanto pessoal quanto artística. Fãs movimentam as redes Logo após o lançamento, o termo “SWAG Out Now” figurava entre os assuntos mais comentados do X (antigo Twitter), especialmente entre o público brasileiro, que reagiu com entusiasmo ao retorno do astro. Esse lançamento também marca um novo capítulo na carreira do cantor, que, em 2023, vendeu os direitos de seu catálogo musical para a Hipgnosis — acordo estimado em US$ 200 milhões, segundo a Billboard. A decisão foi interpretada por muitos como um sinal de que Bieber pretendia reavaliar seus próximos passos no universo da música.  ..."

The new law will make NTRAPS unenforceable. ""The property rights of American homeowners must be safeguarded,"" said Elizabeth Blosser, ALTA's chief of strategy, communications and innovation. ""It is essential to ensure there are no unreasonable restraints on a homeowner's ability to sell or refinance their home in the future due to unwarranted transaction costs."" ""The passage of HB 5185/SB 133 is a continuation of AARP's advocacy efforts, undertaken in collaboration with ALTA in other states, to put an end to this harmful practice,"" said Samar Jha, government affairs director, AARP. ""We look forward to working on similar legislative solutions in more states to help protect homeowners against this predatory real estate practice."" HB 5185/SB 133 follows the objective of similar bills introduced across the country to provide a remedy for existing NTRAPS while also discouraging these types of unfair practices impacting homeowners. ""The New England Land Title Association appreciates the work conducted by the legislature and the governor to curb this type of predatory practice and protect the consumers of Rhode Island,"" said NELTA Executive Director Mark Bennett CAE. ""For older Rhode Islanders, their home is often their greatest asset,"" said Catherine Taylor, state director, AARP Rhode Island. ""Without adequate protections against the predatory nature of these types of agreements, they could lose their financial security that they've worked so hard for. We thank Chairman LaMountain and Chairwoman Donovan for their leadership and dedication to protecting Rhode Island homeowners."" The bill will: Make NTRAPS unenforceable by law. Restrict and prohibit the recording of NTRAPS in property records. Create penalties if NTRAPS are recorded in property records. Provide for the removal of NTRAPS from property records and recovery of damages. A total of 33 states have passed NTRAPS legislation. Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee signed the legislation on June 13, 2025.

mov_501B2548A0EFA552C2872F8A56835462,2025-07-15 12:01:54,en,WEB,"  NEWYou can now listen to Fox News articles! After the disastrous debate performance by President Joe Biden on June 27, 2024, President Donald Trump and his team were jubilant. Biden's team was crushed. And Senate Democrats were in an absolute panic. Josh Dawsey, Tyler Pager and Isaac Arnsdorf are out with a new book on last year's tumultuous presidential campaign. Like “Fight” by Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes and “Original Sin” by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, “2024” has within it much that is familiar, as well as many blasts of new details. The most stunning reveal of the book comes on pages 182-184, wherein the dynamics of a gathering at the offices of the Democratic Senatorial Committee are recounted. Every Democratic senator was present save for Jon Tester and Sherrod Brown, and the account is both full of hysteria and is pretty hysterical to read. (Senator Alex Padilla recited the Serenity Prayer, for example, and when Senator John Fetterman demands a show of hands of support for Biden and only Fetterman, Delaware's Chris Coon's and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois raise their hands.) Stuck into the account of this gathering is the demand from “Jack Reed of Rhode Island [who] said two independent neurologists should evaluate Biden and release their findings.” Think about that. Reed is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services committee and a serious man. West Point. Harvard Law. Genuinely respected by his colleagues on both sides of the aisle. While many in his caucus are worried about politics, Reed is worried about whether has cognitive impairment. What Tapper and Thompson established with great detail in their book —that hundreds and hundreds of Democrats at the party's highest levels had deep concerns about Biden— Dawsey, Pager and Arnsdorf largely avoid confronting while detailing like no other book to date the incredible dysfunction of both the original Biden campaign and its successor Harris campaign. 2024 is the stuff of , nightmares that are not going away anytime soon. Can anyone in the party's circle of consultants and donors actually run a campaign? The Beltway elites of the left are very long in the tooth and perhaps more angry with each other than they are with President Trump. The knives came out right after the Biden debate (Nancy Pelosi put her's into Biden's back; Chuck Schumer drove the dagger in from the front. Now lots of folks are carving up their rivals through interviews with book writers.) While Democrats have fallen into depression and denial, President Trump is marching from victory to victory. That is in part because he's done the job before and knows exactly what he wants and partly because he's got Susie Wiles as his chief of staff. I don't know Wiles, but the portrait Dawsey, Pager and Arnsdorf paint is compelling on the facts of Wiles' competence and character (and that of Chris LaCivita, Wiles' principal deputy on the campaign) as well as the bulk of Team Trump 2024. 2028 will have its own dynamics and probably at least 20 candidates combined from the two parties. Republicans have to hope that Wiles stays put, but the competition for LaCivita's services among GOP would-be nominees will be intense. Will any Democrat want anyone from either the teams to be on their staff? “2024” should be read by every would-be Democratic nominee. There are a lot of Beltway political “experts” who are anything but. Forewarned is forearmed.

Đây là một thành tựu đáng kể, đặc biệt khi dịch vụ Internet vệ tinh của SpaceX có thêm khoảng 5 triệu khách hàng trong cùng kỳ và gần đây vượt mốc 6 triệu người dùng trên toàn cầu. Sue Marek, Giám đốc biên tập tại Ookla, nhận xét việc tốc độ tải xuống (download) trung bình của Starlink gần như tăng gấp đôi từ quý 3/2022 đến quý 1/2025 là một sự phát triển đáng chú ý và ấn tượng. Bà cho rằng điều này phản ánh những nỗ lực mở rộng dung lượng chòm vệ tinh đang tạo ra sự khác biệt. Dịch vụ Starlink tăng gấp đôi tốc độ trong vòng 2 năm. Ảnh: SpaceX Đầu năm 2022, SpaceX có khoảng 1.761 vệ tinh trên quỹ đạo; ngày nay, con số đó là 7.607. Công ty hy vọng cuối cùng sẽ có tới 42.000 vệ tinh trong không gian. Tại Mỹ, những thay đổi trong chương trình Tiếp cận và Phát triển Vốn chủ sở hữu Băng rộng (Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment Program - BEAD) có thể trợ cấp tới 20 tỷ cho Starlink để cung cấp Internet ở các vùng nông thôn. Song, nhiều chuyên gia trong ngành hoài nghi Starlink có thể duy trì tốc độ khi bổ sung hàng triệu khách hàng mới hay không. Lo ngại hoàn toàn có cơ sở. Dữ liệu của Ookla cho thấy chỉ 17,4% khách hàng của Starlink hiện đang có tốc độ Internet đáp ứng định nghĩa tốc độ băng rộng tối thiểu của Ủy ban Truyền thông liên bang (FCC): 100 Mbps tải xuống và 20 Mbps tải lên. Đây cũng là một yêu cầu để nhận trợ cấp từ BEAD. Trong khi hầu hết thuê bao Starlink đang đạt ngưỡng tốc độ tải xuống 100 Mbps, tốc độ tải lên trung bình chỉ là 14,84 Mbps. Độ trễ (latency), hay thời gian dữ liệu di chuyển từ máy tính của người dùng đến nơi đến, cũng ở mức cao – 45 mili giây (ms) so với 12 ms của cả nước. Trải nghiệm Starlink có thể khác biệt đáng kể tùy thuộc vào nơi bạn sinh sống. Tuần trước, SpaceX đã áp dụng ""phí nhu cầu"" 500 USD ở Tây Bắc Thái Bình Dương để chống nghẽn mạng ở các khu vực có mức sử dụng cao. Ở các bang khác có nhiều dung lượng hơn, công ty đang tặng miễn phí thiết bị vệ tinh trị giá 349 USD cho khách hàng. Ookla đã xem xét các khu vực mà Starlink đang cung cấp thiết bị miễn phí và thấy rằng tất cả chúng, ngoại trừ Tây Texas và Alaska, đều có tốc độ tải xuống trung bình trên 100 Mbps. South Dakota, Rhode Island và Wyoming có tỷ lệ khách hàng đạt chuẩn 100/20 Mbps cao nhất, trong khi Alaska, Mississippi và Louisiana có tỷ lệ thấp nhất. (Theo Cnet) Starlink của Elon Musk có thể được triển khai tại Việt Nam trong Quý 4/2025Thứ trưởng Bộ KH&CN Phạm Đức Long cho biết, ngay sau khi doanh nghiệp cung cấp dịch vụ vệ tinh quỹ đạo tầm thấp hoàn tất thủ tục đầu tư, thành lập pháp nhân tại Việt Nam, có thể chính thức triển khai trong Quý 4/2025."

In the picture, Hailey posed wearing yellow bikini bottoms with a Rhode lipgloss tied around her waist. She posed wearing a white and yellow patterned shirt as the clear blue sea glistened behind her, but take a closer look and you'll notice something. Squint your eyes and you might be able to make out a tiny etching on the side of Hailey's hip, which appears to be a dainty fine line tattoo. It is believed to say the word ""gente,"" which means ""people"" in both Spanish and Italian. In another picture for the Rhode campaign, Hailey posed with a cocktail glass on her head as she closed her eyes and smiled, soaking up the sun as she relaxed on the luxurious boat out at sea. She wore a matching yellow and white patterned bikini top and styled her long brunette locks in loose, beachy waves that tumbled over her shoulders. Another picture from her boat day shows the model wearing black sunglasses and a black polka dot bandana as she leaned back and gazed at the ocean in front of her. Hailey took to Instagram to share the pictures with her fans and added the caption: ""Our Rhode summer collection has landed."" She listed off her new products before writing: ""We're so excited to bring our new essentials and the full Rhode lineup to even more of you."" Hailey's brand is now stocked in Austria, Denmark, Finland, Greece, The Netherlands, Poland and Sweden.

He delivered a victory speech as sterling as his performance at Royal St. George's in 2021. As he held the precious claret jug, he paid tribute to the spectators and said, “To see some of the best fans I've ever seen out here, I look forward to making my trip every year to the British Open to see you guys cheer us on.” The R&A must have cringed. It had spent the past several years on a renewed branding campaign to drive home the proper name of this major: The Open Championship. It since has been shortened to “The Open.” It is the first. It is the original. And now the 153rd edition is in Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom but is not on the island of Great Britain. British Open? The Associated Press referred to this major by different names at the start, but for the last century or more has called it the British Open to distinguish it from other national golf championships. Several other news outlets — mainly in the United States, but stretching to other corners of the globe — also called it the British Open. “It's meant to be The Open Championship,” said Adam Scott of Australia. “I've probably slipped and called it the British Open, but I do it mostly with Americans so they know which one.” Imagine his surprise — maybe disgust — to learn that when the Open first came to Northern Ireland in 1951, The Daily Telegraph in Sydney wrote: “South African Bobby Locke and English professional Tom Hargreaves today had record scores on Royal Portrush in the second qualifying round of the British Open golf championship.” “Peter Thomson would roll in his grave,” Scott said with a smile. The Open Championship began in 1860 when Willie Park Sr. defeated seven other golfers at Prestwick in Scotland, the home of golf. It took 35 years for another big championship to come along at Newport Country Club in Rhode Island known as the U.S. Open. That was followed by the South African Open, the Canadian Open and the Australian Open. Just about every country has an Open. The late Robert De Vicenzo has won more than 15 of them, from the German Open and French Open to the Peru Open and Uruguay Open. He also won the biggest Open of them all at Royal Liverpool in 1967. “Roberto de Vicenzo, 44-year-old golfing gaucho from the Argentine, climaxed 20 years of fruitless trying Saturday and beat out defending titleholder Jack Nicklaus by two strokes for the British Open Championship,” the AP story read. When the “British Open” began is a little more unclear. J.H. Taylor won at St. Andrews in 1900 and the AP account referred to the “open golf championship.” Except that a few paragraphs later, it noted Taylor registered his “third triumph in the English championships.” Never mind that it was played in Scotland. British Open was used in 1914 when Harry Vardon won for the record sixth time. The Open left the island Great Britain for the first time in 1951 when it came across the Irish Sea to Royal Portrush. The AP account that year: “Methodical Max Faulkner, a par-wrecking Englishman who spent one winter milking cows to strengthen his golf hands, won the British open championship Friday in a dramatic rain-soaked finish.” Arnold Palmer called it the British Open in his autobiography, “A Golfer's Life.” But when asked by the R&A to write the foreword in a book celebrating 150 years of golf's oldest championship, Palmer called it “The Open Championship.” When in Rome. Nicklaus was talking about his 1986 Masters victory one year when someone asked him how he decided which of his sons, Jack II and Steve, would caddie at which majors. “They started splitting it up,” Nicklaus said. “I think Jackie took the Masters, and I think he had the Open. And Steve had the British Open.” It's an American thing. But not always. One of the grandest occasions in golf was in 1930, when the great Bobby Jones won the British Amateur at St. Andrews and then captured the claret jug at Royal Liverpool on his way to winning the Grand Slam of that era — the impregnable quadrilateral, at it was called. Geoffrey Beazley, the captain of Royal Liverpool, presented the trophy to Jones with a passionate speech that is worth listening to now for those who feel it is sacrilege to refer to this major as anything but “The Open.” “Another championship, a British Open championship, is completed,” he says. Beazley congratulated Jones for not only winning the British Amateur at St. Andrews, “but being here amongst us this evening as winner of the British Open championship.” Ahem.

He also won the biggest Open of them all at Royal Liverpool in 1967. “Roberto de Vicenzo, 44-year-old golfing gaucho from the Argentine, climaxed 20 years of fruitless trying Saturday and beat out defending titleholder Jack Nicklaus by two strokes for the British Open Championship,” the AP story read. When the “British Open” began is a little more unclear. J.H. Taylor won at St. Andrews in 1900 and the AP account referred to the “open golf championship.” Except that a few paragraphs later, it noted Taylor registered his “third triumph in the English championships.” Never mind that it was played in Scotland. British Open was used in 1914 when Harry Vardon won for the record sixth time. The Open left the island Great Britain for the first time in 1951 when it came across the Irish Sea to Royal Portrush. The AP account that year: “Methodical Max Faulkner, a par-wrecking Englishman who spent one winter milking cows to strengthen his golf hands, won the British open championship Friday in a dramatic rain-soaked finish.” Arnold Palmer called it the British Open in his autobiography, “A Golfer's Life.” But when asked by the R&A to write the foreword in a book celebrating 150 years of golf's oldest championship, Palmer called it “The Open Championship.” When in Rome. Nicklaus was talking about his 1986 Masters victory one year when someone asked him how he decided which of his sons, Jack II and Steve, would caddie at which majors. “They started splitting it up,” Nicklaus said. “I think Jackie took the Masters, and I think he had the Open. And Steve had the British Open.” It's an American thing. But not always. One of the grandest occasions in golf was in 1930, when the great Bobby Jones won the British Amateur at St. Andrews and then captured the claret jug at Royal Liverpool on his way to winning the Grand Slam of that era — the impregnable quadrilateral, at it was called. Geoffrey Beazley, the captain of Royal Liverpool, presented the trophy to Jones with a passionate speech that is worth listening to now for those who feel it is sacrilege to refer to this major as anything but “The Open.” “Another championship, a British Open championship, is completed,” he says.

He delivered a victory speech as sterling as his performance at Royal St. George's in 2021. As he held the precious claret jug, he paid tribute to the spectators and said, “To see some of the best fans I've ever seen out here, I look forward to making my trip every year to the British Open to see you guys cheer us on.” The R&A must have cringed. It had spent the past several years on a renewed branding campaign to drive home the proper name of this major: The Open Championship. It since has been shortened to “The Open.” It is the first. It is the original. And now the 153rd edition is in Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom but is not on the island of Great Britain. British Open? The Associated Press referred to this major by different names at the start, but for the last century or more has called it the British Open to distinguish it from other national golf championships. Several other news outlets — mainly in the United States, but stretching to other corners of the globe — also called it the British Open. “It's meant to be The Open Championship,” said Adam Scott of Australia. “I've probably slipped and called it the British Open, but I do it mostly with Americans so they know which one.” Imagine his surprise — maybe disgust — to learn that when the Open first came to Northern Ireland in 1951, The Daily Telegraph in Sydney wrote: “South African Bobby Locke and English professional Tom Hargreaves today had record scores on Royal Portrush in the second qualifying round of the British Open golf championship.” “Peter Thomson would roll in his grave,” Scott said with a smile. The Open Championship began in 1860 when Willie Park Sr. defeated seven other golfers at Prestwick in Scotland, the home of golf. It took 35 years for another big championship to come along at Newport Country Club in Rhode Island known as the U.S. Open. That was followed by the South African Open, the Canadian Open and the Australian Open. Just about every country has an Open.

n396f7p,2025-07-15 13:06:24,en,REDDIT,"  From [Globe.com](http://Globe.com) By Amanda Gokee When Governor Kelly Ayotte signed New Hampshire's budget into law, she also approved legislation eliminating mandatory annual safety inspections for cars in the state. The new provision will go into effect Jan. 31, 2026. Proponents of the measure, including Republican lawmakers, said safety inspections are costly and unnecessary, and it should be up to Granite Staters to decide when to take their car to a mechanic. New Hampshire House Deputy Speaker Steven D. Smith had called the vehicle inspection requirement “the most hated law in the land” in an April interview with [WBZ](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/1002-nightside-with-dan-rea-28654279/episode/nh-weighs-eliminating-vehicle-inspections--273372460/), saying the law had been a money-maker for inspection shops that can force drivers to pay for repairs that don't improve road safety. Other Republican lawmakers have [called annual inspections a scam](https://www.wmur.com/article/new-hampshire-vehicle-inspections-62725/65223243#:~:text=MANCHESTER%2C%20N.H.%20%E2%80%94-,New%20Hampshire%20drivers%20will%20no%20longer%20need%20to%20get%20their,of%20Jan.%2031%2C%202026.) . “In states particularly that had it and got rid of it, we look for the data where everybody died after that happened, and it's just not there,” Smith said. Opponents of the change, including the New Hampshire State Police and industry groups, said the inspections are effective at catching safety problems before they cause accidents. And they said the inspections are an environmental measure that can help limit emissions. State Police said eliminating inspections would shift the responsibility to law enforcement to find unsafe vehicles during traffic stops, when they are already stretched thin. This change will set New Hampshire apart from surrounding states. Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont require an annual safety inspection, while Rhode Island requires biennial inspections. [Connecticut](https://portal.ct.gov/dmv/vehicle-services/get-vehicle-inspection?language=en_US) doesn't require all cars to have an annual safety inspection. The research on whether safety inspections reduce crash rates is inconclusive. The Government Accountability Office found that the impact of safety inspections on vehicle safety was unclear in a 2015 review. And a [2021 research paper](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8296297/) found that period inspection might be associated with a slight reduction in road crashes, but it wasn't able to establish causality. The state is expected to lose $3.4 million in revenue as a result of the change, according to the New Hampshire Department of Safety."

His fans have gone gaga about it, and the posters of the album even featured his wife, Hailey Bieber and their son. Before becoming a family person, the pop star was very popular among women. He had several relationships before settling with Hailey, one of which had always been iconic and that was with Selena Gomez. From having flings to just hookups to an on-again and off-again relationship with Gomez, Bieber has done it all. But do you know with whom he had his first serious relationship and who was his first love? She was the one who even had inspired him to write a song. Yes, that's correct. Scroll ahead. Who Was Justin Bieber's First Girlfriend? Caitlin Beadles was the first ever girlfriend of Bieber who inspired his song 'Never Let You Go.' Their dating phase began in 2008 and it continued for a year before Bieber moved to Atlanta to work with Usher. However, it wasn't meant to be. They parted ways when Bieber was becoming popular in the music industry. Apparently, they had to split because of his intense tour schedule. Justin Bieber with Caitlin and Christian Beadles (2008) pic.twitter.com/M9aU1qhR99 — Justin Bieber Dumps (@JDBieberDumps) January 3, 2025 Justin Bieber was also very good friends with Caitlin's brother Christian. Even after their breakup, they remained friends not only with her brother but also with her. Bieber had gone to celebrate Thanksgiving 2017 with their family too. The brother-sister duo had even attended Bieber's wedding with Hailey Rhode Baldwin. After Caitlin Beadles, the Baby singer had many other flings and relationships with actresses, singers and models. The list of names includes Miranda Kerr (rumored), Kendall Jenner (rumored), Ashley Moore, Kourtney Kardashian, Sofia Richie, and more. But what people would never forget is his romantic tenure with Selena Gomez. They almost had 9 years of relationship although it was on-again and off-again, their fandom Jelena would always consider it to be epic. Their rumored relationship started to surface by the end of 2009. But when the news got out, Gomez had faced a lot of hateful comments from Bieber's female fans. Talking about it, she once told Z100 Radio (via Cosmopolitan), “It hurts, it really does. I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong. I've been best friends with him for a very long time. It does hurt my feelings a lot, but I try not to focus on it.” Since then, they had broken up and patched up several times until they parted ways for good in 2018. justin bieber and selena gomez always had a friendship, and during this friendship justin made it clear several times that he had a little crush on selena, and then they started going out together, but nothing was officialized pic.twitter.com/jfBaXddO9l — vini (@dylstomh) July 5, 2019 After that, Justin Bieber got married to Hailey Bieber in 2018, and created a social media frenzy. On the other hand, after staying single for years, Selena Gomez has finally found her love in Benny Blanco and got engaged to him in 2024. But did you have any idea about Bieber's first love?

The attack, which involved double extortion tactics, allowed the group to access Community Care Alliance's network for several days, during which they exfiltrated 2.5 terabytes of sensitive data. The compromised information included personal and health-related data of nearly 115,000 individuals, such as Social Security numbers, diagnoses, lab results, and insurance details. The lawsuit, filed in Rhode Island state court, alleged that Community Care Alliance was negligent in failing to implement reasonable cybersecurity protections that could have prevented the breach. The organization agreed to settle in order to avoid prolonged litigation and additional legal expenses. The settlement fund will cover legal fees, administrative costs, and provide affected individuals with reimbursement for losses, cash payments, and up to two years of credit and identity monitoring services. This case underscores the critical need for 100% situational awareness through an end-to-end network security and cybersecurity platform such as NIKSUN's. Real-time visibility across all systems, applications, and endpoints allows organizations to detect threats early, respond faster, and prevent breaches before they result in major data loss and reputational harm. Without comprehensive monitoring and threat detection, organizations face not only increased risk of successful attacks but also the costly legal and financial fallout that can follow - ranging from multi-million-dollar settlements to long-term damage to public trust.

mov_DC56B6FC523AB48E47C0BA0A6B0B7141,2025-07-15 13:28:41,en,WEB,"  At a Glance Rhode Island law bans mandatory employer-sponsored meetings on “political” matters, which includes an employer's position on unionization. The new law creates a private right of action for aggrieved employees. On July 2, 2025, Rhode Island Governor Daniel McKee signed into law House Bill No. 5506 SUB A. With the stroke of a pen, Rhode Island joined the growing list of states to ban mandatory employer-sponsored meetings regarding religious and “political matters.” The New Law Based on its seemingly innocuous title, the new Section 28-7-50 of the Rhode Island General Laws is intended to promote and protect “[e]mployee rights of free speech in the workplace.” However, a closer reading of the new law's definitions section reveals its true purpose: to impose a sweeping—and likely unconstitutional—ban on “captive audience” meetings. The law defines “political matters” as “topics that are unrelated to the employer's business or business activities, such as subjects relating to elections for political office, political parties, [and] proposals to change legislation or regulations which are not directly related to the employer's business[.]” However, tacked on to the tail end of the definition of “political matters” is the following language: “a decision whether to join or support any political party, or political, civic, community, fraternal, or labor organization.” (Emphasis added) Effective July 2, 2025, Rhode Island employers are prohibited from discharging, disciplining, penalizing (or threatening to discharge, discipline, or penalize) or otherwise taking any adverse employment action against an employee because they refused to attend a mandatory employer-sponsored meeting to learn about the employer's views and opinions concerning whether employees should join or support a labor union. In addition, the law goes beyond a mere prohibition on “captive audience” meetings to prohibit employers from taking adverse action against an employee for refusing to listen to a speech or view a communication, including an electronic communication, from the employer regarding the employer's opinions on unionization. Aggrieved employees who believe that they have been discharged, disciplined, penalized, or otherwise subjected to an adverse employment action for refusing to subject themselves to the employer's views and opinions on “political matters” will now have a private right of action to sue their current or former employer. The court may award a prevailing plaintiff “all appropriate relief,” including injunctive relief, back pay, reestablishment of employee benefits (including seniority) to which the employee would have been entitled had the violation not occurred, and monetary damages. Additionally, prevailing plaintiffs will be entitled to attorney's fees and costs. The New Law's Preemption Problem Section 28-7-50 appears to be a solution in search of a problem. On November 13, 2024, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued its landmark decision in Amazon.com Services, LLC, ruling that an employer violates the federal National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) by requiring employees, under the threat of discipline or discharge, to attend employer-sponsored meetings for the employer to express its views on unionization. In doing so, the NLRB overruled 76-year-old precedent that recognized the free speech rights of employers to hold such meetings. Many keen observers of the NLRB expect the Board, once it regains the quorum of three members required to conduct business, to revisit this decision in an appropriate case and overrule it. The NLRA preempts state laws that conflict with its provisions or attempt to regulate areas already covered by the NLRA. This principle is rooted in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which establishes that federal law takes precedence over conflicting state laws. Specifically, the NLRA preempts state laws that regulate union organizing, collective bargaining, and unfair labor practices, as the NLRA exclusively governs these areas of labor relations. Accordingly, state-level efforts, such as Section 28-7-50 to ban captive audience meetings, are likely preempted by the NLRA, meaning that the NLRB's ban on captive audience meetings is controlling and state level regulation in this area is unconstitutional. The New Law Will Have a Chilling Effect on Employer Free Speech Rights In addition to federal preemption issues, Section 28-7-50 will have a serious chilling effect on employers seeking to hold voluntary meetings with their employees to discuss whether to join or support a union. Prior to the NLRB's November 2024 ruling in Amazon.com Services, LLC, Rhode Island employers held workplace meetings for a wide variety of legitimate purposes: Expressing the Employer's Views and Opinions on Unionization: Employers held “captive audience” meetings to explain their views and opinions on unions, emphasizing why they believed unionization would not be in the best interests of the company or its employees. These meetings often highlighted the employer's preference for maintaining open, honest, and direct communication with employees without the involvement of an unnecessary third-party intermediary, such as a union. Educating Employees About Unionization: Many employees are often unaware of the implications of unionization, including the potential costs associated with union membership (such as union dues and initiation fees) as well as the challenges of the collective bargaining process. “Captive audience” meetings were held to address common misconceptions about unionization, employee rights, and employer obligations under the NLRA. Addressing Employee Concerns: “Captive audience” meetings provided a valuable opportunity for employers to address specific questions or concerns that employees had about the terms and conditions of their employment and the impacts that unionization would have on those terms and conditions. Highlighting Existing Employee Benefits: Employers used “captive audience” meetings to remind employees of the valuable employee benefits they already received, such as paid leave, health insurance, and other perks. They also used these meetings to emphasize that employee benefits were not guaranteed to improve or change through collective bargaining. Countering Union Misinformation Campaigns: Employers used “captive audience” meetings to respond to false, misleading, and inaccurate information shared during unionization campaigns, pointing out that unions can make lofty promises during organizing efforts but cannot guarantee outcomes without the employer's agreement through collective bargaining. Section 28-7-50 establishes a new private right of action for current and former employees who feel they have been ""penalized"" for refusing to attend voluntary informational meetings, listen to speeches about joining or supporting a labor organization, or read electronic communications from their employers regarding unionization. This law may restrict employers' ability to express themselves freely in the workplace. If employers believe that they can only share information that is legally required or necessary for employees to perform their job duties, they could find themselves at a significant disadvantage when facing a rapidly developing unionization campaign."
mov_759C944581ED18CBB682DEAE41E007DA,2025-07-15 13:47:28,en,WEB,"  It's only Dr. Tenny Thomas's second day on the job as president at Newport Hospital, and he's already facing an agonizing decision. Brown University Health has said it is considering eliminating labor and delivery services at Newport Hospital as part of an effort to close a “severe budget shortfall,” although a spokeswoman said a final decision hasn't been made. “ We take our responsibility to ensure that mothers and babies receive the highest level of care possible very seriously,” Brown Health spokeswoman Sharon Torgerson said. “That commitment requires strong infrastructure and clinical expertise. At this point, no final decisions about the birthing center have been made, and there have been no immediate changes to our budget, operations, or staffing. We expect to make definitive decisions in the weeks ahead.” The Newport City Council is fired up about the potential closure of the birthing center, and it's holding a special meeting at 7 p.m. to discuss a resolution urging Brown Health and Newport Hospital to maintain all maternity services at the hospital. Tonight's council meeting also comes after my colleague Alexa Gagosz reported that at least 300 women has their annual OB-GYN appointments scheduled at the Newport Women's Health Services at Newport Hospital unexpectedly postponed. The bigger picture: Council resolutions are nonbinding, but they can influence decision-making if enough residents voice their displeasure about a decision like this one. The resolution is sponsored by Councilman Xay Khamsyvoravong, a Democrat who appears to have a bright future in Rhode Island politics. Leadership at Brown Health knows this, and might want to avoid a public fight with a future statewide officeholder if it can find cuts elsewhere. Khamsyvoravong sent an email to constituents this week with a gloomy subject line: “The Last Generation of Newporters?” “Eliminating Newport's Birthing Center will immediately impact the bottom line of the city of Newport and will have devastating impacts on our community's ability to attract families and equitably serve those that are here,” Khamsyvoravong wrote. He urged Newport residents to send a message to Dr. Thomas. “It's important that he understand, on day one, that access to women and family health is a priority for this community,' Khamsyvoravong wrote.

mov_3030FD849427708F64938A3AE71C9800,2025-07-15 15:00:00,en,WEB,"  Wilco's Jeff Tweedy has rounded up 30 new songs for his latest solo album, Twilight Override, which will be spread across three different discs upon their Sept. 26 release by the band's dBpm Records. The tracks “One Tiny Flower,” “Out in the Dark,” “Stray Cats in Spain” and “Enough” are available to sample below. “When you choose to do creative things, you align yourself with something that other people call God. And when you align yourself with creation, you inherently take a side against destruction,” Tweedy muses. “Youʼre on the side of creation. And that does a lot to quell the impulse to destroy. Creativity eats darkness. Sort of an endless buffet these days — a bottomless basket of rock bottom. Which is, I guess, why Iʼve been making so much stuff lately. That sense of decline is hard to ignore, and it must be at least a part of the shroud Iʼm trying to unwrap. The twilight of an empire seems like a good enough jumping-off point when one is jumping into the abyss.” More from Spin: “Twilight sure is a pretty word, though,” he continues. “And the world is full of happy people in former empires, so maybe thatʼs not the only source of this dissonance. Whatever it is out there (or in there) squeezing this ennui into my day, itʼs fucking overwhelming. Itʼs difficult to ignore. Twilight Override is my effort to overwhelm it right back. Here are the songs and sounds and voices and guitars and words that are an effort to let go of some of the heaviness and up the wattage on my own light. My effort to engulf this encroaching nighttime (nightmare) of the soul.” The album was recorded and self-produced by Tweedy at Wilco's longtime Chicago studio the Loft and sports contributions from his musical children, Spencer and Sammy, plus frequent collaborators James Elkington, Sima Cunningham, Macie Stewart and Liam Kazar. The artist will preview material from it during a Substack livestream at 4pm ET today (July 15). “Iʼm not trying to imply that I had this all mapped out as a story,” Tweedy admits. “The way that this ended up falling together and being arranged, it does tell a story that I think I wanted to tell. Thatʼs what a process does for me. This is why it sounded right to me in this order, aside from tempos and music.” Tweedy will support Twilight Override with an extensive fall solo tour, beginning Oct. 8 in Three Oaks, Mi. Beforehand, he'll play July 27 at the Newport Folk Festival in Rhode Island. Wilco is also on the road through late August, including several dates as part of the Bob Dylan/Willie Nelson co-headlined Outlaw Music Festival. In related news, Wilco members John Stirratt and Pat Sansone have reactivated their Autumn Defense side project for their first album since 2014.

mov_EB98D8CD23F2D07F3002FF6396A20751,2025-07-15 16:00:38,en,WEB,"  Massachusetts Fatal Fire FALL RIVER, Mass. (AP) — A Massachusetts assisted-living center where nine residents died in a fire was cited for failing to immediately report more than two dozen health and safety incidents, according to regulators' most recent review of the facility. Five men and four women were killed and at least 30 others were injured Sunday night at Gabriel House in Fall River, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Boston. Some of the 70 residents were rescued by ladder after screaming for help from the windows of the three-story building. The cause of the blaze is under investigation. The 100-unit facility, which opened in 1999 in a former motel built decades earlier, was last inspected by the state on Oct. 31, 2023, according to a report from the state Executive Office of Elder Affairs. The report cited the facility for seven deficiencies, four of which were repeat problems. After the facility responded with a corrective action plan, it was re-certified through November 2025. Most of the issues involved missing documentation. For example, seven resident files that were reviewed were missing documents to indicate that their service plans were reassessed within 30 days of moving in, as required. The plans outline the services each resident receives, including whether they need help with medication and meals. The review also found problems with the reporting of safety incidents. Facilities are supposed to submit reports of incidents that could have a significant negative effect on residents' health, safety or welfare within 24 hours, but the review found 26 reports that were sent later than that between May 5, 2022, and Oct. 31, 2023. The report did not specify the total number of incidents, or provide any details about what they involved. The state also watched two staffers provide medication assistance to seven residents and found several problems, including failure to document when eye drops were opened, loose tablets in medication storage areas and partially opened medication. Advocates question staff size and other issues Some residents said only two or three staffers were working at the time of the fire, and they offered little help. ""They left us alone and ran out into the parking lot,” said Lorraine Ferrara. “I was hanging out the window — 'Help! Help!' and they just kept running.” Paul Lanzikos, a former Massachusetts secretary of elder affairs and co-founder of the advocacy group Dignity Alliance, said the group was concerned about reports on the lack of fire drills, the small number of staff members for a highly dependent population and safety issues such as a broken elevator and air conditioners in the windows. “It's a terrible tragedy that should have never happened,” Lanzikos said. Richard Moore, another co-founder of Dignity Alliance, has asked the attorney general to investigate based on similar concerns as well as the facility owner's history. Dennis Etzkorn, owner of Gabriel Care LLC, was indicted on medical assistance fraud and kickback charges in 2012, though the charges were dismissed three years later. “The fact that it happened in the past and that this now happened suggests that there should be a more thorough investigation of that,"" said Moore, former head of the Massachusetts Assisted Living Association and a former state senator. He said the assisted-living industry overall needs more rigorous regulation and oversight. And while it's too early to say what went wrong at Gabriel House, he said the staffing levels and training appear to have been inadequate. Regulations require emergency plans Current regulations do not require a specific number of staff members, but the rules say facilities “shall have a plan to secure staffing necessary” to respond to emergencies. “There should have been more staff. They should have been trained in the case of fire or other emergency,” Moore said. “Quarterly, they should have been doing fire drills. It seemed like residents didn't know what to do.” Etzkorn declined to comment to The Associated Press. He told the Boston Globe in a statement Monday that he and his family were “devastated by the tragedy” and that he will continue to cooperate with authorities. By Tuesday morning, the facility's broken windows had been boarded up, and bouquets of flowers and a rosary were set on the ground against a post wrapped with yellow police tape. Ann O'Neil-Souza, chief of staff for the mayor, said city officials expect to find homes for the survivors from Gabriel House by the end of Tuesday. She said most were being placed with other facilities in the city and with family, and hospitals have been asked to work with social workers to ensure patients find housing when they are discharged. The dead ranged in age from 61 to 86, authorities said. The Bristol County District Attorney's Office identified seven of the deceased as Rui Albernaz, 64; Ronald Codega, 61; Margaret Duddy, 69; Robert King, 78; Kim Mackin, 71; Richard Rochon, 78; and Eleanor Willett, 86. The office said the names of a 70-year-old woman and a 77-year-old man had not been released pending notification of family. ___ Ramer reported from Concord, New Hampshire.

The decision to withhold $6.8 billion for a review of consistency with presidential priorities “is contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and unconstitutional,” according to the July 14 lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. A motion for a preliminary injunction was filed the same day. The freeze affects adult education and students through the 12th grade. The frozen funds include money for immigrant children and English learners, after-school care, teacher recruitment and training, and bullying and suicide prevention. States are in “chaos” after making plans for the upcoming academic year in reliance on the money, the suit says. The Washington Post, the Associated Press and NPR are among the publications with coverage, while the attorneys general of California, New York, Colorado and North Carolina are among those issuing press releases. Withholding the funds violates “multiple statutory and regulatory commands,” the suit says. They include the Impoundment Control Act, which limits agencies' ability to withhold appropriated funds; and the Administrative Procedure Act, which prohibits arbitrary and capricious agency conduct. Freezing the funds also violates the separation of powers doctrine and the presentment clause, which outlines the process for bills to become law, according to the suit. “It is Congress, not the executive branch, that possesses the power of the purse,” the suit says. “The Constitution does not empower the executive branch to unilaterally refuse to spend funds appropriated by Congress and enacted into law.” The Trump administration plans to test the Impoundment Control Act by refusing to spend mandated funds, the Washington Post has previously reported. Joining the lawsuit are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin and the District of Columbia, as well as the governors of Pennsylvania and Kentucky.

mov_15AA60FF01DFBECEFD3CF02598D70F83,2025-07-15 19:00:08,en,WEB,"  The Department of Health and Human Services finalized the layoffs of thousands of employees after a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for the Trump administration to proceed with mass firings across the government. Employees received notice of their termination late Monday, marking a turning point in the reshaping of the nation's health care work force. Those let go included people who coordinated travel for overseas drug facility inspectors, communications staff members, public records officials and employees who oversaw contracts related to medical research. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced 10,000 layoffs late in March, cutting workers across the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other federal health agencies. Some workers who received the initial layoff notices on April 1 found out only when their badge to enter a building did not work. Still, many of them remained on the federal payroll until Monday at 5 p.m., when a message went out citing last week's Supreme Court decision that allowed Trump officials to significantly slash the size of the federal payroll even as court challenges to the administration's plans play out. “Thank you for your service to the American people,” the email said. While many of the workers were described by the Trump administration as redundant or duplicative, critics have compared the cuts to leaving only doctors — and no support staff — to operate a hospital. The result is a hobbled work force, said Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health and a former Biden administration health official. “What I have seen is some of the very best people, people who have alternatives, who have choices, have decided they just don't want to stay in this limbo land,” Dr. Jha said. He added that those who survive the layoffs may look elsewhere, because “they don't want to be in an organization that's under such upheaval.” In March, Mr. Kennedy announced a “dramatic restructuring” of the federal health work force, with a total of 20,000 jobs pared from the health department through a February round of layoffs, early retirements and buyouts. The plan also called for paring the department's 28 divisions to 15. Though Mr. Kennedy cited the department's $1.8 trillion budget at the time, experts on federal spending said less than 1 percent of that funding went to payroll, with the vast majority of the money covering medications, and hospital and nursing home bills for Medicare and Medicaid patients. A federal lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by 19 states and the District of Columbia challenged the firings and reorganization, saying they had detrimental effects on states where crucial services were abruptly halted, including specialized testing for sexually transmitted diseases and management of help lines that assist people who want to quit smoking. An H.H.S. spokesman said workers cited in that ongoing lawsuit were not given notices on Monday. This month, a judge in the Rhode Island case ruled that the cuts and reordering of services approved by Congress were most likely unlawful. Firings at the National Institutes of Health included officials responsible for releasing public records, raising concerns within the agency about its commitment to transparency, said an N.I.H. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the layoffs. They also included officials who worked on agency contracts related to medical research materials and studies. Many of those workers had been asked to work while on administrative leave in recent months, the official said, suggesting that the agency had struggled to make do without them. At the F.D.A., similar callbacks went out to staff members who coordinate travel for foreign inspections, though some were let go on Monday. A number of workers were offered their jobs back since April 1, including many who worked in occupational health, lead poisoning response and other roles at the C.D.C. Others who were rehired included food safety lab professionals and generic drug approval experts at the F.D.A. Responding to questions from lawmakers in late June, Mr. Kennedy said he brought back hundreds of workers who left “gaps in our ability to perform our duties.” Christina Jewett covers the Food and Drug Administration, which means keeping a close eye on drugs, medical devices, food safety and tobacco policy.

FULL TEXT At the Museum of Arts and Design at 2 Columbus Circlein New York in early June, Jonathan Adler, the potter and founder of the home furnishings company that bears his name, looked up at a blue and white ceramic apothecary jar he had designed in 2018. It had wavering stripes and the letters LSD on it. ""It's a nod to my love of Delft pottery and reimagined as if the potter was on an acid trip,"" Adler said, adding that he does not partake. Around him, an opening night party for the show he had assembled from the museum's extensive ceramics collection and his own work raged and raved. Adler, 58, moved among family, friends and vitrines spotlighting notable ceramic art works that had inspired him since he was a pottery-obsessed ""nerd"" growing up in New Jersey. He often took the train to the institution then known as the American Craft Museum and located on East 53rd Street. Many of the 300 or so objects on display - divided into categories including animals, erotica, optimism, metallica and more - offered a provocative lesson about humor and irreverence in the history of ceramics. In a section about Americana, Adler's grenade vases and rocket decanters (inspired by euphemisms for inebriated like ""bombed,"" ""blasted"" and ""tanked"") sat in dialogue with Howard Kotler's American Supperware from the late 60s. Kotler's plates depict flags and the White House in states of collapse. ""His work spanned so many different ideas and not only mixed materials but mixed art with commerce,"" Adler said. A section devoted to erotica took in Adler's porcelain breast-patterned vases and his suggestive banana versions, playing off Marvin Lipofsky's glass lips from 1967. In a section concentrating on animals, Adler admired a 1994 cast bronze ""Monkey Chair"" with primate faces and bodies as arms, and swirling tails as the back. ""Judy Kensley McKie finds ways to toy with animal forms in an idiosyncratic and fantastic style,"" he said of the Boston-based sculptural furniture maker who is now in her 80s. As he breezed past works from the museum's collection, he admired them like old friends. ""Ruth Duckworth's work removes the noise of decoration to expose pure form,"" he said of her white cups backed with square blades. The section inspired by the Funk Ceramics movement that came out of San Francisco in the late 1960s (it included Robert Arneson, Viola Frey, Peter Voulkos and others) consisted almost entirely of jokes and gags. Adler's needlepoints of ""Shrooms,"" his shoe-sized acrylic pills and a gilded ceramic lollipop holder vied for laughs with Arneson's earthenware ""Self-Portrait of the Artist Losing His Marbles"" (1965) and David Gilhooly's ""Bread Frog as a Coffee Break"" (1981), a kind of miniature glazed earthenware totem pole. ""Funk is one of my favorite genres because it was subversive and weird and crazy and silly,"" Adler had said earlier in a slide presentation about the show. ""One of the things funk people loved was making puns, and it kind of shows how on some level language can stimulate creativity and how there's a dialogue between language and objects."" In fact, one of the first studios where he worked throwing pots, in Hell's Kitchen, was called Mud, Sweat & Tears. His stoneware ""Macho Macho Mugs"" made with faces of the Village People, is here for laughs, too, among walls that could almost be mistaken for a shop display, but with curatorial panels that analyze and comment. And yes, several Adler pieces are for sale in the museum shop - nothing new in a post-Keith Haring world of crossed lines of art, design and commerce in museums. ""If Kehinde Wiley or Takashi Murakami has a show, they have merchandise for sale in the shops, and a show also promotes sales in their galleries,"" said Ezra Shales, a professor of craft and design history at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, who teaches Adler to his students as an example of virtuosity in the way he makes humor look beautiful. ""Jonathan's work has historic references but without the weight,"" Shales explained. But joking aside, Adler's affection for the often overlooked medium runs deep. ""He's extremely knowledgeable about the history of ceramics, and has a lot to say about inspiration and technique,"" said Elissa Auther, the chief curator of the Museum of Arts and Design. She acknowledged that showing the work of a living designer has a commercial crossover but explained that she wanted to bring someone in to interpret the museum's collection alongside her own curatorial observations. Adler, she pointed out, knew how he wanted to display everything, and gave explicit directions to Simon Doonan, his husband and the creative director behind the cheeky window displays of the former Barneys New York. One corner of the show is a recreation of Adler's studio, with inspirational objects on shelves and clippings and quotes on the walls. ""Make Pots Not War,"" one reads. Adler's company, which was acquired this year by Consortium Brand Partners with plans to expand beyond his 10 locations in the United States and London, has annual sales of $150 million. Not bad for a Brown University undergraduate who took pottery classes down the hill at the Rhode Island School of Design (known as RISD) in the late 1980s and made, among other things, a Chanel teapot. ""But when I applied for their M.F.A. program in ceramics, they rejected me,"" he said. By 1992 the Museum of Arts and Design (operating then as the American Craft Museum) was selling one of his first striped ceramic vases, and in 1998, he opened his first store in SoHo. His career from there spun out (pun intended) to include the interior design of the Parker Palm Springs Hotel, serving as a judge on Bravo's ""Top Design"" and creating a life-size dream house in Malibu for Barbie's 50th anniversary. But even with all that, his potter's soul remains. He put it simply: ""I'm a grown man who gets to play with mud all day."" A couple of days after the opening, Adler was in his studio on West Broadway in SoHo, which is behind a window in the back of his kaleidoscopic store full of chandeliers, sofas, pillows, and myriad midcentury-inflected objects that he has referred to as his ""prescription for antidepressive living."" Two of his associates were muddy from sculpting the Foo Dog vases that Adler, who still tries out new ideas as maquettes in clay, had imagined. On the shelves all kinds of past design ideas thrown on a wheel and often fired in the kiln on site - ashtrays, vases, busts and more - had accumulated like so many spurned lovers. ""So many things I make fail,"" Adler sighed. ""The truth is that every idea I have is ridiculous and to try to make anything when there are so many things on the planet already is preposterous, I know that, but to do what I do you have to have a bubbling sense of possibility."" He looked over a set of ashtrays he named for decidedly unglamorous towns. ""They're going to bomb,"" he said. ""But I challenge myself to not be too rational.""

Steinberg, who came out of retirement to chair Rhode Island's new Life Science Hub, is stepping down from the high-profile post after less than two years in the role, he told the Boston Globe in an exclusive interview. The longtime president and CEO of the Rhode Island Foundation said Tuesday his decision was personal: “There's nothing nefarious about this, this is just me personally, wanting more time.” “I want to do other things,” said Steinberg, who was appointed by Governor Dan McKee in October 2023. The Hub “is great, and important to the state. I believe in it, but I've just put in a lot more time than I wanted to. And I'm ready to do something else.” Steinberg, who informed McKee and Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi of his resignation on Monday evening, will remain in the unpaid role through the end of September. According to state law, it will be up to McKee to appoint a new chair. Read more in the link."

Individual property tax bills will vary depending on the type of building and its property value, but the average residential property bill will go up by 6%. Rhode Island cities and towns cannot increase their tax levies by more than 4% each year [without an exception from the General Assembly.] (https://www.providencejournal.com/story/news/local/2025/06/27/taxes-increases-will-exceed-state-cap-providence-woonsocket-glocester-little-compton-rhode-island/84352936007/) Providence sought an exemption from the General Assembly this year to go above the cap.

mov_F20B5B9ACE9E6231D4A5B8885B66D349,2025-07-15 19:26:39,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Ha comenzado la búsqueda de culpables tras el incendio en una residencia para ancianos de Massachusetts que dejó nueve personas muertas y decenas de heridos, con preguntas sobre si había suficientes bomberos para responder y si el personal hizo lo suficiente para ayudar. También se ha cuestionado la seguridad y la preparación para desastres de la instalación, después de que el estado la mencionara anteriormente por no informar numerosos incidentes de salud y seguridad. Esto es lo que se sabe sobre el incendio, sus víctimas y cómo han reaccionado las autoridades y los residentes tras el incidente. Lo que se sabe sobre el incendio PUBLICIDAD Los bomberos respondieron a la llamada de la Gabriel House en Fall River, a unos 80 kilómetros (50 millas) al sur de Boston, alrededor de las 9:50 de la tarde del domingo, y se encontraron con humo denso y llamas en la parte frontal del edificio. El incendio dejó atrapados a los residentes, algunos de los cuales colgaban de las ventanas pidiendo auxilio, dijeron las autoridades el lunes. Al menos 30 personas resultaron heridas. Unos 50 bomberos acudieron al lugar, incluidos 30 que estaban fuera de servicio. La policía ayudó a derribar puertas y llevó a una docena de residentes a un lugar seguro. Cinco bomberos heridos fueron dados de alta del hospital el lunes. El origen y la causa del incendio están bajo investigación, y la fiscalía de distrito del condado de Bristol dijo el lunes que la causa “no parece ser sospechosa”. Lo que se sabe sobre la Gabriel House PUBLICIDAD La Gabriel House es una residencia para ancianos que abrió en 1999 y tiene 100 unidades, según la Oficina Ejecutiva de Envejecimiento e Independencia de Massachusetts. En su sitio web se promocionan apartamentos tipo estudio “para aquellos ancianos que no pueden permitirse el alto costo de la vida asistida”, así como cuidado de adultos en grupo a poca distancia de tiendas, restaurantes e iglesias. Aquellos que viven solos en apartamentos tipo estudio pagan entre 1.850 y 2.400 dólares mensuales, dependiendo de su nivel de servicios, según el sitio web. La residencia también ofrece un plan de vida básico que incluye apartamentos tipo estudio compartidos, pero no se especifica un precio. “Si ocurre una emergencia, sin importar la hora, habrá alguien listo para ayudar”, se afirma en el sitio web. La gobernadora de Massachusetts, Maura Healey, describió en una conferencia de prensa a los residentes de la instalación como una población vulnerable, muchos de los cuales están confinados a sillas de ruedas y requieren tanques de oxígeno. Los fallecidos tenían edades comprendidas entre 61 y 86 años. PUBLICIDAD Dennis Etzkorn, el propietario de la instalación, se negó a comentar el lunes, pero las autoridades dijeron que está cooperando con lo que el jefe de bomberos Jeffrey Bacon llamó “una investigación muy amplia”. Tensión sobre la preparación y respuesta al incendio Un sindicato de bomberos dijo que la inadecuada dotación de personal obstaculizó la respuesta al fuego y contribuyó al número de muertos. Un capitán de bomberos dijo que no había equipo de respiración disponible cuando llegó, por lo que buscó puerta a puerta sin un tanque de aire hasta que el humo lo afectó. “Hicimos lo mejor que pudimos con lo que teníamos, y lo que teníamos no era suficiente”, dijo Michael O'Reagan, presidente del sindicato de bomberos de Fall River. El alcalde Paul Coogan dijo que la dotación de personal del departamento de bomberos se basa en las recomendaciones del jefe de bomberos. PUBLICIDAD “No podríamos haber tenido suficiente gente aquí para salvar a todos los que necesitaban ayuda anoche”, dijo Bacon. Mientras tanto, varios residentes elogiaron a los bomberos y a la policía por sus heroicos esfuerzos de rescate, pero dijeron que los miembros del personal hicieron poco para ayudar. Richard Moore, exjefe de la Asociación de Vida Asistida de Massachusetts y exsenador estatal, ha pedido al fiscal general que investigue. Dijo que le preocupaba lo que había escuchado sobre las circunstancias que provocaron el incendio, como los simulacros insuficientes y un propietario que fue acusado en 2012 de fraude de asistencia médica y cargos de soborno que fueron desestimados tres años después. La Gabriel House fue mencionada por no informar más de dos docenas de incidentes de salud y seguridad en un solo día, como lo exige la ley estatal, según la revisión más reciente de la instalación por parte de los organismos reguladores. Fall River tiene problemas económicos Con unos 94.000 residentes, Fall River es la décima ciudad más grande del estado y una de las más pobres. Alguna vez, la comunidad de clase trabajadora del sur de Massachusetts fue un centro global para la fabricación textil, pero la decadencia de la industria provocó dificultades económicas y una disminución de la población. En las últimas décadas ha surgido algún nuevo desarrollo e inversión. En 2021, el exalcalde Jasiel Correia fue condenado en un juicio por corrupción y sentenciado a seis años de prisión. La Gabriel House se encuentra en un vecindario denso de edificios de apartamentos de tres pisos, al sur de Kennedy Park, el parque más grande de la ciudad. El incendio de Fall River es el más mortífero en Massachusetts desde que 15 personas murieron en 1984 en un incendio en una casa de huéspedes en Beverly, según el Departamento de Servicios de Bomberos del estado. Ocho personas perdieron la vida en un incendio en un apartamento en Lowell en 1982, siete personas fallecieron en un incendio en un apartamento en Lawrence en 1978, y un incendio en un almacén en Worcester en 1999 cobró la vida de seis bomberos. El jefe de cocina Paul Ferreira dijo que quienes vivían en la instalación habían luchado durante mucho tiempo para encontrar una vivienda asequible.

Smith en Providence, Rhode Island, y Holly Ramer en Concord, Nueva Hampshire.

Last week, WMUR-TV reported first that Christopher Landry, a legal U.S. resident who is a Canadian national, said he was denied entry at the border in Maine over the weekend. He said he was held for three hours with two of his five children and turned back to Canada over old misdemeanor offenses tied to marijuana and a suspended license from 2004 and 2007. “It definitely has made a tremendous mountain out of a molehill,” Landry told CTV in Canada. “I was absolutely shocked. I crossed the same port of entry since 2007, with no, no, issues at all.” Landry told CTV he is very concerned for his family's well-being at home. “It's terrible. It's, you know, everything in my life is essentially put on hold. But my primary concern right now is, you know, how is my family going to survive at home without me,” he said. Landry is not the first New Hampshire resident to be denied entry into the U.S. Earlier this Spring, Nashua resident and German National Fabian Schmidt was taken into custody at Logan Airport in Boston. He was eventually released in May, after 60 days in an ice detention facility in Rhode Island. Landry told CTV that he is determined to make it home to his family. “I'm just, I'm hopeful that, you know, we can get this cleaned up and I can go home and resume my life. My quiet life, you know, just going to work and raising my kids and trying to provide a good future for them,” Landry said. Customs and Border Patrol released a statement saying that green card holders who faced charges previously could be detained at the border. “Landry had criminal convictions for drug possession that violated his green card status,” the agency said in the statement. “He and his children returned to Canada after being given the opportunity to obtain his court documents to reapply for admission into the country. Possessing a green card is a privilege, not a right, and under our nation's laws, our government has the authority to revoke a green card if our laws are broken and abused. Lawful Permanent Residents presenting at a U.S. port of entry with previous criminal convictions may be subject to mandatory detention and/or may be asked to provide additional documentation to be set up for an immigration hearing.” Please note: This content carries a strict local market embargo.

In a three-page resignation letter dated July 15, Steinberg wrote that he wants to spend time with his family and travel as part of his retirement, along with working on ""other key"" priorities in the state including public education, health care and housing. ""Given the SUBSTANTIAL time I have invested in the past few years, and the solid foundation now established, I am willing to make this resignation effective on a day of your choosing, but not later than September 30, 2025,"" he wrote to Gov. Dan McKee. Steinberg was volunteering his time on the board. The Life Science Hub was initially funded with $45 million from the state. . Among the other achievements is this last legislative session when the hub secured changes to its enabling statute, the organization convened a 500-person summit and a $10-million agreement to establish Ocean State Labs, an incubator for life sciences, to be housed inside of the new seven-story building that also will house the new State Health Laboratory. ""Our progress confirms the potential for the life sciences to contribute to Rhode Island's broader economic development strategy over the long term,"" Steinberg wrote. ""Realizing this potential will, of course, require additional financial resources beyond the ARPA funds which will fund the agency through 2026.""

mov_61AC5D1DA7BD6B1B33254837A25ACC55,2025-07-15 21:09:00,en,WEB,"  Providence Mayor Brett Smiley signs the fiscal year 2026 budget at his City Hall office on July 15, 2025. Standing from left to right are Providence City Councilors Pedro Espinal, Helen Anthony and Rachel Miller. Anthony chairs the council's finance committee and Miller is Council President. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) An unusually lengthy saga to craft Providence's 2026 fiscal plan concluded Tuesday morning with Mayor Brett Smiley signing what he called “the most difficult budget” since his tenure began in 2023. “We passed a balanced budget, and we did so without making cuts to city services while still making real sacrifices, to demonstrate both our own belt tightening, and to make sure that the burden of this year's budget was not put exclusively on our taxpayers,” Smiley told reporters at a Tuesday morning press event in his City Hall office immediately before he added his signature to the budget. City councilors, city employees and a couple of state legislators joined Smiley on the morning after the Providence City Council approved the budget for the second time via a 12-2 vote at a special meeting. (The Providence City Council needs to vote on matters twice before they can be sent to the mayor for final approval.) There were two no votes on the budget's second pass from Councilors Shelley Peterson and Oscar Vargas. Councilor Ana Vargas was absent. Smiley's initial draft of the 2026 spending plan arrived on April 16. The ensuing 12 weeks involved much back-and-forth as councilors and the mayor enlisted the help of the Rhode Island General Assembly to permit the city to increase its levy, or overall tax revenue, above the 4% state-mandated annual cap. Two of the lawmakers who co-sponsored the legislation to OK the tweaked levy cap — Sen. Sam Zurier and Rep. Scott Slater, both Providence Democrats — attended the press conference and stood quietly in the lineup alongside Smiley and City Council President Rachel Miller. The final $624 million budget accommodates a 5.85% increase in the city's levy, below the 8% allowed by the recent state legislation or the 7.5% Smiley proposed initially. While the budget technically lowers property tax rates, higher property values mean most people will still receive bigger tax bills. The budget was revised in late June to even out tax bill increases among different types of homeowners. The finalized budget includes an average residential property tax increase of 6%, although non-owner-occupied homes with two to five units will still see the highest increase. The budget for fiscal year 2026 arrives two weeks after the fiscal year began on July 1. “Effective today, you can come in to the city tax collector to pay your bill if you're anxious to do so,” Smiley said, and added that bills will also be available online this week. Paper bills via mail are being printed this week and should start to arrive in mailboxes sometime next week, Smiley added. Because the budget arrived late, taxpayers will have a grace period until Aug. 20 to make their first quarterly payment. First-quarter tax bills are usually due in late July. The 2026 budget also doubles the veteran's exemption and increases the elderly exemption by 25%. Smiley said people who have had tax exemptions in the past don't need to reapply. First-time applicants who are eligible can visit the tax assessor's office at City Hall. An embroidery seen on display in Providence Mayor Brett Smiley's office. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current) A 'monumental' budget process “It bears repeating that this was an exceptionally tough year,” said City Council President Rachel Miller, noting spiking home values, rising rents and the cost of living for the city's working class families as challenges to tackle in this year's budget process. “On top of it all, we were faced with the added difficulty of making up for decades of underfunding our schools in this one year,” Miller added. “So the task before us as we entered this process was monumental.” More in U.S. That underfunding exerted the most weight upon the budget: A November 2024 settlement with the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) requires the city to pay $15 million, plus make additional investments in subsequent fiscal years, to cover deficits in the city's school department, which has been under state control since 2019. For fiscal year 2026, the city needed to allot about $11 million toward the school settlement. To fill the sudden crater in the city budget, Smiley relied on the levy cap exemption and some deep slashes to individual municipal departments' budgets. Smiley and city officials told reporters this was perhaps the first time so many departmental line items had been cut in one fell swoop. Smiley said many city departments will have to “make do with less, and you're going to have offices being expected to produce the same amount of work with fewer employees, and so we know that that's a sacrifice.” More than 20 positions — all of them vacant — were eliminated in this year's budget, and Smiley said he does not expect the positions will return in the future. But the mayor emphasized the budget leaves core city services like trash, public safety and emergency services untouched. “I think it is the right and compassionate thing to do to look for opportunities to cut where, one, it won't affect any services, and two, someone doesn't lose their job,” Smiley said. “These city employees are our neighbors, our friends, your kids' Little League coach. We are not going out looking to try to cut jobs and lay people off.” The hiring freeze initiated at the start of the budget process has ended, Smiley said, as open positions are ones included in the budget. Meanwhile, Miller said one of the council's priorities is finding new ways to think about revenue in Providence that don't rely on property taxes. Both Miller and the mayor agreed that the city's payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) agreement with Brown University, which finalized in 2023, had been struck just in time. “I'm certain that if we were in negotiations with the private colleges today, given the changes in the federal landscape and the new financial pressures that they're under, that their offer would be far less than what we were able to sign two years ago,” Smiley said, but noted he was not as “satisfied with where we are with the hospitals.” Both Care New England and Brown University Health, the state's largest health systems, have PILOT agreements with the city. Miller said she agreed with Smiley and characterized the PILOT agreements with local colleges as “the strongest Providence has seen.” But the city, she added, is limited in its powers over institutions like Brown, whose state charter predates that of the city itself. “I think that we have opportunities to work with the General Assembly to think about what any nonprofit institution expanding means for our tax rolls, because Providence cannot afford to keep removing property from the tax roll,” Miller said...."
mov_888D3C2350CBCDEC0DDA7B9C4BE2BF81,2025-07-15 21:09:41,en,WEB,"  Back in February, shortly after Dr. Mary Claire Haver and I published the Citizen's Guide to Menopause Advocacy, I wrote an essay entitled “Is This the One Issue That Can Transcend Political Lines?” for Katie Couric Media readers. In it, I proclaimed, “We have to get serious about mobilizing the menopausal masses — the legions of everyday people failed by our nation's dismal investment in and delivery of women's mid-life healthcare. Menopause reforms would improve the lives of 75 million individuals, while boosting the economy and helping families. In fact, these may be among the only women's health matters that can transcend the political gridlock over the next few years.” Five months later, let the record show that the essay's headline was right on the money: A burgeoning movement is making waves at all levels of government. Menopause legislation — state by state The Citizen's Guide deliberately zeroed in on priorities that already enjoyed bipartisan or private sector support at the state level — such as upgrading public education about menopause, improving training for healthcare providers, and ensuring access to menopause treatments. The result? More than two dozen bills introduced across 15 states, red and blue alike. As of July 2025, the following states have officially passed menopause laws: California (continuing medical education opportunities for providers); Illinois (mandatory insurance coverage for menopause treatments and a dedicated Menopause Awareness Week); Louisiana (mandatory insurance coverage for menopause treatments); Maine (state health department educational resources); Rhode Island (workplace protections); and Washington (support for accessing treatment). When legislative sessions come to a close by the end of the month, we will update the Citizen's Guide (and KCM article) with links to every bill introduced this session, and whether or not it passed, so you can see where your state stands. All told, this progress shows tremendous potential. Getting laws on the books is just one marker of success. It's just as important that lawmakers are willing to step up and speak out on the issue. And while it can take years for bills to cross the finish line, simply having the language on record has value: snippets of provisions, even full text, often find their way into budgets, and hearings yield compelling testimony. For the record, this is exactly what happened — twice! — with regard to legislation to make menstrual products more affordable and accessible. Recycled language turned up in two bills that went on to become the law of the land: The First Step Act of 2018 (a federal criminal justice law that mandated pads and tampons be provided in federal prisons) and The CARES Act of 2020 (the first pandemic stimulus package made menstrual products eligible for pre-tax allowances under Flexible Spending and Health Savings Accounts). Notably, both are the only federal menstrual equity laws in the nation's history. Meaning that change can also happen in unexpected times and places. Movement on the federal level This week, the Food and Drug Administration will hold a two-hour briefing with medical experts to focus on menopausal hormone treatments. The session is open to the public and will be live-streamed; you can sign up and watch it here. Among the issues addressed will be the decades-old labeling requirement for estrogen products, a.k.a. the “black box warning.” The Citizen's Guide argues the FDA should eliminate the warning on packaging for vaginal estrogen — which is the most effective treatment for genitourinary symptoms of menopause and can improve and even save women's lives. New York Times health and wellness reporter Jancee Dunn : “When I brought the tube home from the pharmacy, I was alarmed by the all-caps warning emblazoned on the box, alerting users of the risks of ENDOMETRIAL CANCER, CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS, BREAST CANCER, AND PROBABLE DEMENTIA. (Probable dementia?) .” For many women, after reading that label, they throw the prescription right in the trash. For doctors not trained in menopause care — translation, the vast majority, including OB-GYNs — many refuse to prescribe it at all. According to Citizen's Guide contributor Rachel Rubin, MD, who is among those presenting at the FDA, eliminating the warning would also save our healthcare system billions. She says, “As women get older, they become more susceptible to frequent urinary tract infections. We have excellent data, spanning many decades, showing that vaginal estrogen products reduce the risk of future UTIs by more than 50 percent — which means less pain, fewer urgent care visits and hospitalizations, and even reduced risk of death, due to sepsis.” Dr. Rubin is part of a team that published a 2024 report showing that if Medicare patients regularly received vaginal estrogen, the program could save between $6 billion and $22 billion per year. In 2014, physicians filed a citizen petition to counter the FDA requirement, which the agency denied. Last year, the effort was reignited by the nonprofit Let's Talk Menopause through a campaign called Unboxing Menopause. The general public must be aware of this history, given the current state of U.S. federal health agencies, particularly the FDA. The advocacy community will hold the FDA to a fair, transparent process at this week's hearing and thereafter. More in Health These are challenging times for women's health, no doubt. We must keep mobilizing to ensure progress on an issue as important and far-reaching as menopause care."

Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over. According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop. The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II. The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%. The National Center for Education Statistics' data shows that public school enrollment in Virginia decreased 2.9% from fall 2019 to fall 2023. (Map courtesy NCES) A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students. Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%. Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic. A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025. The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts. Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure. ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity. However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who've left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

The suspect, Vaughn Malloy, fired his gun at a K9 and killed him. STONINGTON, Conn. — State police troopers were justified in using deadly force on a suspect in 2023, a report by the Office of the Inspector General stated. The report released by the Inspector General Robert Devlin, Jr. follows an investigation into the fatal shooting of 42-year-old Vaughn Malloy and K9 Broko in Stonington. The shooting happened Dec. 21, 2023, as the Connecticut State Police Violent Crime Task Force, which included officers from Norwich, Groton Town and Waterford police departments, tried to execute an arrest warrant for Malloy at a home on Mechanic Street. The warrant, issued back in June 2022, was for first-degree assault and other related charges stemming from a shooting incident that occurred in April. According to the report, Malloy had reportedly fired a gun into the front of a home in Norwich, striking a woman. The task force underwent ongoing surveillance of Malloy's residence on Mechanic Street in the Pawcatuck section of Stonington before getting a search warrant. The state police tactical unit executed the warrant along with members of the Rhode Island State Police Tactical Unit. According to the Inspector General's report, the officers verbally ordered Malloy to leave the home and surrender on multiple occasions. Sign up for the FOX61 newsletters: Morning Forecast, Morning Headlines, Evening Headlines Due to Malloy's noncompliance, they breached the door of the Mechanic Street home using an extended ram at the front of their armored vehicle, the report said. After breaching the door, Malloy ran out of an adjoining unit via a back door and into the backyard. The report stated that officers were positioned back there as well, and they saw Malloy with a pistol. The officers verbally commanded Malloy to stop, but he ignored the orders and ran eastbound. According to the report, as Malloy ran, state police K9 Broko was deployed to try to stop him. At the same time, officers deployed two ""less lethal impact munitions"" at Malloy. As Malloy fell to the ground, K9 Broko went after him. The report stated that Malloy then fired several rounds at the dog and troopers, striking a police vehicle. K9 Broko was fatally injured. RELATED: Connecticut's Broko's Law protecting Police K-9s takes effect Sergeant Sean Paddock, Troopers Gregory Fascendini, Christopher Church and Jarred Bolduc then fired at Malloy several times. Troopers at the scene then tried giving Malloy first aid and called EMS, who rushed him to Lawrence Memorial Hospital, where he later died from his injuries. The Inspector General's report found that the Connecticut State Police Tactical Unit had ""the responsibility to arrest Malloy on a lawfully issued warrant charging him with a violent crime."" The report said that the unit's initial approach was to try to convince Malloy to surrender. When Malloy fled, officers pivoted to less-lethal force with foam-tipped impact rounds and the deployment of a K9. It was when Malloy fired his gun that troopers returned fire, the report said. The Inspector General's report said that Malloy firing his gun posed a threat of ""serious injury or death"" to all troopers on scene. The office's investigation found that the use of deadly force was justified given the circumstances. Devlin said any reasonable officer in the same situation would share the same belief that they were at risk of ""grave harm."" You can read the full report here.

mov_357ACEE459F7F8897DA22CD1CDA3B10E,2025-07-15 22:00:00,en,WEB,"  This author has written several summer novels, and although “Mansion Beach” may be considered a beach read, it is more than that. It is about wealth, class, the past that won't stay buried, and the high cost of achieving perfection. It takes place on Block Island, Rhode Island, providing a picturesque backdrop to the story, which has been compared to “The Great Gatsby,” except the leading characters are women and not men. There is nothing wrong with that! Nicole Carr, 29, is eager for a fresh start. She quit her lawyer job in Boston, breaks up with her live-in boyfriend and moves to Block Island to participate in a marine biology internship. She is living in a cottage that belongs to her cousin David, or really to his father-in-law, Brice Buchanan, a real estate mogul. David and his wife, Taylor, live in an enormous vacation home with their beautiful young daughter and house guest, pro golfer, Jack Baker, who is a handsome, charming playboy. As Nicola settles in, she learns that Block Island is full of secrets, past and present. Juliana lives in the mansion next door to Nicola's cottage, where Nicola is often disturbed by late-night parties. Juliana is a self-made fashion tech mogul preparing to present her business to the public. She is glamorous, yet fragile. She has had a painful climb from the working class to her CEO status. Her buried secrets are about to be revealed as she attempts to rekindle a past love. Juliana develops a surprising connection to Nicola. Taylor Buchanan has been groomed by her father to run the family's real estate empire. She is bold and ruthlessly strategic, determined to have it all. She begins to unravel, however, as the story progresses, by the backlash from the community over her family's new construction, and her crumbling marriage. From Juliana's imposter syndrome to Nicola's understated privilege, and Taylor's inherited empire, the novel never loses sight of the social structures that shape women's lives. As the summer advances, Nicola has a few dates with playboy Jack fighting the attraction she feels for him. Juliana reconnects with her past love, and Taylor ends a brief affair. (Spoiler alert!) There is a drowning that takes place that readers don't hear about until the end. I actually didn't find it that meaningful to the story, except when Nicola was told who was responsible, which was not a big surprise. When the summer ends and everyone goes their own way, Nicola reflects upon her time on Block Island. She found herself drawn into a world of opulence and conflict that challenged her understanding of herself. Through her eyes readers experienced Taylor's high stake power games and Juliana's reinvention. At the very end there is a surprise. This book is not so much a mystery, but a drama about three very different women who are striving to achieve their own personal perfection. If you want to dive a little deeper than just a light beach read, this book might hit the spot.

mov_66D3CD348A21283DACB6DBCAF445E2D1,2025-07-16 00:07:09,en,WEB,"  FALL RIVER, Mass. (AP) — A Massachusetts assisted-living center where nine residents died in a fire was cited for failing to immediately report more than two dozen health and safety incidents, according to regulators' most recent review of the facility. Five men and four women were killed and at least 30 others were injured Sunday night at Gabriel House in Fall River, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of Boston. Some of the 70 residents were rescued by ladder after screaming for help from the windows of the three-story building. Investigators have not determined the cause of the blaze, which was the state's deadliest fire in more than four decades. The 100-unit facility, which opened in 1999 in a former motel built decades earlier, was last inspected by the state on Oct. 31, 2023, according to a report from the state Executive Office of Elder Affairs. The report cited the facility for seven deficiencies, four of which were repeat problems. After the facility responded with a corrective action plan, it was re-certified through November 2025. Most of the issues involved missing documentation. For example, seven resident files that were reviewed were missing documents to indicate that their service plans were reassessed within 30 days of moving in, as required. The plans outline the services each resident receives, including whether they need help with medication and meals. The review also found problems with the reporting of safety incidents. Facilities are supposed to submit reports of incidents that could have a significant negative effect on residents' health, safety or welfare within 24 hours, but the review found 26 reports that were sent later than that between May 5, 2022, and Oct. 31, 2023. The report did not specify the total number of incidents, or provide any details about what they involved. The state also watched two staffers provide medication assistance to seven residents and found several problems, including failure to document when eye drops were opened, loose tablets in medication storage areas and partially opened medication. Advocates question staff size and other issues Some residents said only two or three staffers were working at the time of the fire, and they offered little help. “They left us alone and ran out into the parking lot,” said Lorraine Ferrara. “I was hanging out the window — 'Help! Help!' and they just kept running.” Paul Lanzikos, a former Massachusetts secretary of elder affairs and co-founder of the advocacy group Dignity Alliance, said the group was concerned about reports on the lack of fire drills, the small number of staff members for a highly dependent population and safety issues such as a broken elevator and air conditioners in the windows. “It's a terrible tragedy that should have never happened,” Lanzikos said. Richard Moore, another co-founder of Dignity Alliance, has asked the attorney general to investigate based on similar concerns as well as the facility owner's history. Dennis Etzkorn, owner of Gabriel Care LLC, was indicted on medical assistance fraud and kickback charges in 2012, though the charges were dismissed three years later. “The fact that it happened in the past and that this now happened suggests that there should be a more thorough investigation of that,” said Moore, former head of the Massachusetts Assisted Living Association and a former state senator. He said the assisted-living industry overall needs more rigorous regulation and oversight. And while it's too early to say what went wrong at Gabriel House, he said the staffing levels and training appear to have been inadequate. Regulations require emergency plans Current regulations do not require a specific number of staff members, but the rules say facilities “shall have a plan to secure staffing necessary” to respond to emergencies. “There should have been more staff. They should have been trained in the case of fire or other emergency,” Moore said. “They should have been doing fire drills. It seemed like residents didn't know what to do.” Etzkorn declined to comment to The Associated Press. He told the Boston Globe in a statement Monday that he and his family were “devastated by the tragedy” and that he will continue to cooperate with authorities. Meanwhile, a state commission working to improve long-term care in Massachusetts held a moment of silence Tuesday “for the lives that were lost and the lives that were put on the line” in Fall River. The Assisted Living Residences Commission, created by lawmakers last year as part of a broader effort, faces an Aug. 1 deadline to recommend policies to ensure facilities meet the health and safety needs of residents. But members said they may seek more time given the fire. “We need to do a deep dive based on the investigation results with this facility, but also the facilities like this one,” state Rep. Thomas Stanley said. Some residents still homeless By Tuesday morning, the facility's broken windows had been boarded up, and bouquets of flowers and a rosary were set on the ground against a post wrapped with yellow police tape. A steady stream of cars pulled up to the Catholic Charities Diocese of Fall River to drop off donated items for the displaced residents, and the city is working with multiple organizations to collect money. “There's a lot of generosity and love being shared with the city of Fall River and the people who suffered so much the other night,” Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon said. Ann O'Neil-Souza, chief of staff for the mayor, said city officials expect to find homes for the survivors from Gabriel House by the end of Tuesday. She said most were being placed with other facilities in the city and with family, and hospitals have been asked to work with social workers to ensure patients find housing when they are discharged. The dead ranged in age from 61 to 86, authorities said. The Bristol County District Attorney's Office identified seven of the deceased as Rui Albernaz, 64; Ronald Codega, 61; Margaret Duddy, 69; Robert King, 78; Kim Mackin, 71; Richard Rochon, 78; and Eleanor Willett, 86. The office said the names of a 70-year-old woman and a 77-year-old man had not been released pending notification of family. ___ Ramer reported from Concord, New Hampshire.

Facilities are supposed to submit reports of incidents that could have a significant negative effect on residents' health, safety or welfare within 24 hours, but the review found 26 reports that were sent later than that between May 5, 2022, and Oct. 31, 2023. The report did not specify the total number of incidents, or provide any details about what they involved. The state also watched two staffers provide medication assistance to seven residents and found several problems, including failure to document when eye drops were opened, loose tablets in medication storage areas and partially opened medication. Advocates question staff size and other issues Some residents said only two or three staffers were working at the time of the fire, and they offered little help. “They left us alone and ran out into the parking lot,” said Lorraine Ferrara. “I was hanging out the window — 'Help! Help!' and they just kept running.” Paul Lanzikos, a former Massachusetts secretary of elder affairs and co-founder of the advocacy group Dignity Alliance, said the group was concerned about reports on the lack of fire drills, the small number of staff members for a highly dependent population and safety issues such as a broken elevator and air conditioners in the windows. “It's a terrible tragedy that should have never happened,” Lanzikos said. Richard Moore, another co-founder of Dignity Alliance, has asked the attorney general to investigate based on similar concerns as well as the facility owner's history. Dennis Etzkorn, owner of Gabriel Care LLC, was indicted on medical assistance fraud and kickback charges in 2012, though the charges were dismissed three years later. “The fact that it happened in the past and that this now happened suggests that there should be a more thorough investigation of that,” said Moore, former head of the Massachusetts Assisted Living Association and a former state senator. He said the assisted-living industry overall needs more rigorous regulation and oversight. And while it's too early to say what went wrong at Gabriel House, he said the staffing levels and training appear to have been inadequate. Regulations require emergency plans Current regulations do not require a specific number of staff members, but the rules say facilities “shall have a plan to secure staffing necessary” to respond to emergencies. “There should have been more staff. They should have been trained in the case of fire or other emergency,” Moore said. “They should have been doing fire drills. It seemed like residents didn't know what to do.” Etzkorn declined to comment to The Associated Press. He told the Boston Globe in a statement Monday that he and his family were “devastated by the tragedy” and that he will continue to cooperate with authorities. Meanwhile, a state commission working to improve long-term care in Massachusetts held a moment of silence Tuesday “for the lives that were lost and the lives that were put on the line” in Fall River. The Assisted Living Residences Commission, created by lawmakers last year as part of a broader effort, faces an Aug. 1 deadline to recommend policies to ensure facilities meet the health and safety needs of residents. But members said they may seek more time given the fire. “We need to do a deep dive based on the investigation results with this facility, but also the facilities like this one,” state Rep. Thomas Stanley said. Some residents still homeless By Tuesday morning, the facility's broken windows had been boarded up, and bouquets of flowers and a rosary were set on the ground against a post wrapped with yellow police tape. A steady stream of cars pulled up to the Catholic Charities Diocese of Fall River to drop off donated items for the displaced residents, and the city is working with multiple organizations to collect money. “There's a lot of generosity and love being shared with the city of Fall River and the people who suffered so much the other night,” Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon said. Ann O'Neil-Souza, chief of staff for the mayor, said city officials expect to find homes for the survivors from Gabriel House by the end of Tuesday. She said most were being placed with other facilities in the city and with family, and hospitals have been asked to work with social workers to ensure patients find housing when they are discharged. The dead ranged in age from 61 to 86, authorities said. The Bristol County District Attorney's Office identified seven of the deceased as Rui Albernaz, 64; Ronald Codega, 61; Margaret Duddy, 69; Robert King, 78; Kim Mackin, 71; Richard Rochon, 78; and Eleanor Willett, 86. The office said the names of a 70-year-old woman and a 77-year-old man had not been released pending notification of family. ___ Ramer reported from Concord, New Hampshire.

mov_1899E9C12BC990AB2C53896B995A044D,2025-07-16 00:40:42,en,WEB,"  Taylor Swift shares why she did not attend the gold event in Lake Tahoe over the weekend with her boyfriend, Travis Kelce. Taylor Swift was not spotted alongside Travis Kelce over the weekend as he attended the American Century Championship golf tournament. Kelce was not alone, though as his brother, Jason Kelce, also participated in the event. Several other A-list athletes participated in the annual golf event, including Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen, Golden State Warriors point guard Stephen Curry, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, former New York Yankees shortstop Derek Jeter, and more. Swift didn't attend the event last year either because she was on her record-breaking Eras Tour. This year, it appears Swift didn't want to take the spotlight off Travis and the other contestants, so she skipped the event. However, this year, her intentions were different, according to a source, per Elle, which claims Swift decided not to attend to keep the spotlight on Kelce and the other athletes at the tournament. The reason behind the singer's choice not to attend the event lines up with what a previous source shared told People about the couple wanting to stay low-key. “Taylor and Travis are soaking up every minute of this slower season together. They've been splitting their time between New York, Nashville, and a few quiet getaways, just enjoying each other's company without all the usual chaos. This kind of downtime is rare for both of them, and it's really allowed their bond to deepen.” The source shared that the couple who began dating in 2023 are on the same page when it comes to furthering their relationship. “It's been a turning point for their relationship in a lot of ways,” the source explained. “They're incredibly happy and in sync. There's a calmness and ease to their relationship right now that's been really grounding for Taylor and Travis.” Instead of her highly-anticipated Fourth of July party at her Rhode Island mansion, Swift and Kelce opted to celebrate the holiday in Montana. They decided to watch the fireworks at Yellowstone Club, according to DeuxMoi's latest newsletter. The last time that the 14-time Grammy winner through the event was in 2023. Even though they have been mainly keeping a low profile, Kelce previously addressed how some backlash from fans online that said the couple was “seeking attention” from their date nights. They recently were spotted watching the Stanley Finals Game 4. “It gets thrown out there, like we're trying to seek attention every now and then,” Kelce told the Bussin With The Boys podcast. “We're just enjoying life and having fun going to hockey games, kinda introducing her to some more of the sports world.” While the singer was not at the event, fans still thought of her as one called out to the Kansas City Chiefs tight end: “You have the best girlfriend in the world,” the fan yelled in the Kansas City Chiefs tight end's direction. Expand Tweet Kelce turned around and responded, “Good point.” While Swift didn't attend the tournament she is excited about cheering Kelce on as he enters his 13th year in the NFL. “Taylor is really looking forward to the upcoming NFL season. Not just because she loves supporting Travis, but because for the first full season since they started dating, she's not juggling a packed tour schedule,” the source told PEOPLE last month. “This fall will be completely different,” the insider said. “It's the first season where she's not constantly flying back and forth or working around an entire touring calendar.” The Chiefs first game of the 2025-26 season is against the Los Angeles Chargers on Friday, September 5, 2025, in São Paulo, Brazil.

mov_8BDF26AFC917535EC6704E195D632326,2025-07-16 01:41:04,en,WEB,"  Maryland joined nearly two dozen states and the District of Columbia in suing the Trump administration for withholding $6.8 billion in previously authorized education grants intended for K-12 and adult education programs. According to the Maryland Attorney General's Office, the federal Department of Education notified states on June 30 that it was rescinding the money for six formula programs. That, the attorneys general argue, violates various federal laws and regulations as well as the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine. Statewide, $110 million is on the line - nearly $99 million anticipated by the Maryland State Department of Education and $11.49 million for adult education programs, according to state schools officials. The lawsuit, filed in the federal District Court of Rhode Island, seeks a ruling that declares the funding freeze unlawful and makes the funds available to the states again. ""This reckless funding freeze is directly harming Maryland's students by taking more than $110 million from Maryland K–12 schools and adult education programs, which has jeopardized teacher training, thrown essential special needs services into chaos, and left families scrambling to find childcare before the start of a new school year,"" Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement Monday. The federal Department of Education traditionally makes about a quarter of these funds available for states around July 1 each year, according to the attorney general's office. But this year broke the trend, as the education department says it is aligning spending with the executive branch's priorities. ""The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,"" the Department of Education's June 30 notice to the Maryland State Department of Education said in part, according to court documents. But the attorneys general argue it wasn't up to the Trump administration, stating in court filings that Congress designated the funding streams as ""formula grants,"" which the government is obligated to disperse to the states. ""The frozen funding does not derive from discretionary or competitive grant programs. Formula funds are calculated automatically using specific formulas written into the law and administered by (the Department of Education),"" State Superintendent of Schools Carey Wright wrote in a court document. The Maryland State Department of Education is still working to understand the full effects of the funding freeze, which might result in layoffs, she wrote. Maryland school districts have already created budgets for the upcoming school year that assumed they would receive the formula funding, according to Wright. And some Maryland school districts ""have active summer programming that is funded in whole or (in) part by the funding that is currently being withheld."" Representatives from the Maryland State Department of Education declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation. Instead, the department released a statement: ""We are committed to supporting our school systems, students, and families as the uncertainty of the federal funding landscape for many programs continues. Our state is not deterred from our focus on maintaining high standards and accountability that drives student success."" Baltimore City Public Schools is losing more than $11 million in funding that was meant to support 29 full-time positions, ""critical contractual support,"" instructional materials and other resources, Kimberly Hoffman, executive director of data monitoring and compliance for the district, wrote in a court filing. Hoffman listed programs such as professional development, teacher recruitment, English education for multilingual learners and AP classes as items the now-withheld federal money contributed to. When asked for comment, Baltimore City Public Schools referred The Baltimore Sun to a portion of Hoffman's court declaration. ""Because these federal funds have been withheld, City Schools will face challenges in ensuring that staffing, materials, and other resources will be fully in place for the start of the 2025-2026 school year,"" Hoffman wrote. ""As a result, (the Department of Education's) actions threaten to undermine the carefully planned and targeted interventions and supports that City Schools has invested to continue its recognized progress in student growth."" Anne Arundel County will lose $4.2 million if the funding is not reinstated. More than 28,000 Maryland adult learners, including those learning English and those working toward their high school diplomas, are served by education department formula grants authorized under the Adult Education and Family Literacy Act, Erin Roth, assistant secretary of the Maryland Department of Labor's Division of Workforce Development and Adult Learning, wrote in court filings. The AEFLA money supports nine full-time Adult Education and Literacy Services employees, 100 subgrantee employees, more than 1,000 part-time subgrantee instructors, instructional materials, educational software licenses and assessments for adult learners, Roth wrote. Cuts to adult learner programming ""concretely limit(s) their economic mobility,"" as those without a high school diploma in Maryland in 2023 earned about 20% less than those who have one, Roth said in the filing. The Department of Education said last week it was ending ""taxpayer subsidization of illegal aliens in career, technical, and adult education programs"" under AEFLA and other statutes. The state Department of Labor declined to comment due to the ongoing litigation. The Department of Education is even making cuts to itself, as the president and Education Secretary Linda McMahon work toward their goal of dismantling it. The Supreme Court greenlit layoffs of nearly 1,400 of the department's employees on Monday. ""We will carry out the reduction in force to promote efficiency and accountability and to ensure resources are directed where they matter most - to students, parents, and teachers,"" McMahon said in a statement Monday after the decision came down. ""As we return education to the states, this Administration will continue to perform all statutory duties while empowering families and teachers by reducing education bureaucracy.""

According to the Maryland Attorney General's Office, the federal Department of Education notified states on June 30 that it was rescinding the money for six formula programs. That, the attorneys general argue, violates various federal laws and regulations as well as the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine. Statewide, $110 million is on the line - nearly $99 million anticipated by the Maryland State Department of Education and $11.49 million for adult education programs, according to state schools officials. The lawsuit, filed in the federal District Court of Rhode Island, seeks a ruling that declares the funding freeze unlawful and makes the funds available to the states again. ""This reckless funding freeze is directly harming Maryland's students by taking more than $110 million from Maryland K–12 schools and adult education programs, which has jeopardized teacher training, thrown essential special needs services into chaos, and left families scrambling to find childcare before the start of a new school year,"" Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement Monday. The federal Department of Education traditionally makes about a quarter of these funds available for states around July 1 each year, according to the attorney general's office. But this year broke the trend, as the education department says it is aligning spending with the executive branch's priorities. ""The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,"" the Department of Education's June 30 notice to the Maryland State Department of Education said in part, according to court documents. But the attorneys general argue it wasn't up to the Trump administration, stating in court filings that Congress designated the funding streams as ""formula grants,"" which the government is obligated to disperse to the states. ""The frozen funding does not derive from discretionary or competitive grant programs. Formula funds are calculated automatically using specific formulas written into the law and administered by (the Department of Education),"" State Superintendent of Schools Carey Wright wrote in a court document. The Maryland State Department of Education is still working to understand the full effects of the funding freeze, which might result in layoffs, she wrote. Maryland school districts have already created budgets for the upcoming school year that assumed they would receive the formula funding, according to Wright.

According to the Maryland Attorney General's Office, the federal Department of Education notified states on June 30 that it was rescinding the money for six formula programs. That, the attorneys general argue, violates various federal laws and regulations as well as the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine. Statewide, $110 million is on the line - nearly $99 million anticipated by the Maryland State Department of Education and $11.49 million for adult education programs, according to state schools officials. The lawsuit, filed in the federal District Court of Rhode Island, seeks a ruling that declares the funding freeze unlawful and makes the funds available to the states again. ""This reckless funding freeze is directly harming Maryland's students by taking more than $110 million from Maryland K–12 schools and adult education programs, which has jeopardized teacher training, thrown essential special needs services into chaos, and left families scrambling to find childcare before the start of a new school year,"" Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement Monday. The federal Department of Education traditionally makes about a quarter of these funds available for states around July 1 each year, according to the attorney general's office. But this year broke the trend, as the education department says it is aligning spending with the executive branch's priorities. ""The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,"" the Department of Education's June 30 notice to the Maryland State Department of Education said in part, according to court documents. But the attorneys general argue it wasn't up to the Trump administration, stating in court filings that Congress designated the funding streams as ""formula grants,"" which the government is obligated to disperse to the states. ""The frozen funding does not derive from discretionary or competitive grant programs. Formula funds are calculated automatically using specific formulas written into the law and administered by (the Department of Education),"" State Superintendent of Schools Carey Wright wrote in a court document. The Maryland State Department of Education is still working to understand the full effects of the funding freeze, which might result in layoffs, she wrote.

My perception of Connecticut is that it really doesn't care about Rhode Island and is more focused on its relation to NYS (my rudimentary understanding is RI:MA::CT:NY). It would be a mistake to assume geographic closeness has resulted in cultural closeness. Honestly, I think in strong federal systems, this kind of imposing of relational flag design is detrimental to strong flag design, as you get this sort of thing where people go ""oh, there's a North *and* a South Carolina, they should have a similar flag"" completely ignoring the way people in those places conceptualize of their state."

According to the Maryland Attorney General's Office, the federal Department of Education notified states on June 30 that it was rescinding the money for six formula programs. That, the attorneys general argue, violates various federal laws and regulations as well as the Constitution's separation of powers doctrine. Statewide, $110 million is on the line — nearly $99 million anticipated by the Maryland State Department of Education and $11.49 million for adult education programs, according to state schools officials. The lawsuit, filed in the federal District Court of Rhode Island, seeks a ruling that declares the funding freeze unlawful and makes the funds available to the states again. “This reckless funding freeze is directly harming Maryland's students by taking more than $110 million from Maryland K–12 schools and adult education programs, which has jeopardized teacher training, thrown essential special needs services into chaos, and left families scrambling to find childcare before the start of a new school year,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement Monday. The federal Department of Education traditionally makes about a quarter of these funds available for states around July 1 each year, according to the attorney general's office. But this year broke the trend, as the education department says it is aligning spending with the executive branch's priorities. “The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,” the Department of Education's June 30 notice to the Maryland State Department of Education said in part, according to court documents. But the attorneys general argue it wasn't up to the Trump administration, stating in court filings that Congress designated the funding streams as “formula grants,” which the government is obligated to disperse to the states. “The frozen funding does not derive from discretionary or competitive grant programs. Formula funds are calculated automatically using specific formulas written into the law and administered by (the Department of Education),” State Superintendent of Schools Carey Wright wrote in a court document. The Maryland State Department of Education is still working to understand the full effects of the funding freeze, which might result in layoffs, she wrote. Maryland school districts have already created budgets for the upcoming school year that assumed they would receive the formula funding, according to Wright. And some Maryland school districts “have active summer programming that is funded in whole or (in) part by the funding that is currently being withheld.” Representatives from the Maryland State Department of Education declined to comment, citing the ongoing litigation.

Just imagine that blaze. It consumed an area pretty much the same size as the state of Rhode Island in less time than it takes to get an Amazon Prime delivery. It was so iconic as a destructive force that the US military studied the prevailing conditions that are believed to have led to the firestorm so that they could replicate the phenomenon in war. That's how you got those crazy aerial shots of the Tokyo burn runs in '44. It's not innovation, it's imitation. This is scary.

40418453B8995F6C7F46BA07124A1CFE,2025-07-16 07:23:49,en,PRINT,"  Staff members who were first notified of terminations in April were finally let go late Monday. The Department of Health and Human Services finalized the layoffs of thousands of employees after a Supreme Court ruling cleared the way for the Trump administration to proceed with mass firings across the government. Employees received notice of their termination late Monday, marking a turning point in the reshaping of the nation's health care work force. Those let go included people who coordinated travel for overseas drug facility inspectors, communications staff members, public records officials and employees who oversaw contracts related to medical research. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. announced 10,000 layoffs late in March, cutting workers across the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other federal health agencies. Some workers who received the initial layoff notices on April 1 found out only when their badge to enter a building did not work. Still, many of them remained on the federal payroll until Monday at 5 p.m., when a message went out citing last week's Supreme Court decision that allowed Trump officials to significantly slash the size of the federal payroll even as court challenges to the administration's plans play out. ''Thank you for your service to the American people,'' the email said. While many of the workers were described by the Trump administration as redundant or duplicative, critics have compared the cuts to leaving only doctors -- and no support staff -- to operate a hospital. The result is a hobbled work force, said Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health and a former Biden administration health official. ''What I have seen is some of the very best people, people who have alternatives, who have choices, have decided they just don't want to stay in this limbo land,'' Dr. Jha said. He added that those who survive the layoffs may look elsewhere, because ''they don't want to be in an organization that's under such upheaval.'' In March, Mr. Kennedy announced a ''dramatic restructuring'' of the federal health work force, with a total of 20,000 jobs pared from the health department through a February round of layoffs, early retirements and buyouts. The plan also called for paring the department's 28 divisions to 15. Though Mr. Kennedy cited the department's $1.8 trillion budget at the time, experts on federal spending said less than 1 percent of that funding went to payroll, with the vast majority of the money covering medications, and hospital and nursing home bills for Medicare and Medicaid patients. A federal lawsuit filed in Rhode Island by 19 states and the District of Columbia challenged the firings and reorganization, saying they had detrimental effects on states where crucial services were abruptly halted, including specialized testing for sexually transmitted diseases and management of help lines that assist people who want to quit smoking. An H.H.S. spokesman said workers cited in that ongoing lawsuit were not given notices on Monday. This month, a judge in the Rhode Island case ruled that the cuts and reordering of services approved by Congress were most likely unlawful. Firings at the National Institutes of Health included officials responsible for releasing public records, raising concerns within the agency about its commitment to transparency, said an N.I.H. official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the layoffs. They also included officials who worked on agency contracts related to medical research materials and studies. Many of those workers had been asked to work while on administrative leave in recent months, the official said, suggesting that the agency had struggled to make do without them. At the F.D.A., similar callbacks went out to staff members who coordinate travel for foreign inspections, though some were let go on Monday. A number of workers were offered their jobs back since April 1, including many who worked in occupational health, lead poisoning response and other roles at the C.D.C. Others who were rehired included food safety lab professionals and generic drug approval experts at the F.D.A. Responding to questions from lawmakers in late June, Mr. Kennedy said he brought back hundreds of workers who left ''gaps in our ability to perform our duties.''"

Neither does motive. If you do your research even the blue states that got hit either both signed into the smart city plans, or are extremely important to our economy. This is a breakdown of how certain types of American towns — specifically sovereign-minded, independent, rural communities — have been disproportionately hit by major natural disasters between 2000 and 2025. These towns are usually small, generational, located in mountainous or forested areas, and known for resisting federal policies like zoning laws, FEMA control, government mandates, and land buyouts. They represent only about 2.5% of all towns in the United States and about 4.2% of the population, yet they account for roughly 68% of all town-level disasters in that 25-year span. There are around 7,000 of these towns in the U.S., and only 13 were completely or mostly destroyed by wildfire, flood, or similar events. That may seem small, but compared to the 28,000 other rural towns in similar mountainous or high-risk geography that were not culturally sovereign or resistant, only 4 were hit during that same period. The remaining 250,000+ towns and cities — mostly suburban and urban — account for just 2 or 3 major town-level disasters in 25 years. Statistically, sovereign towns are around 13.6 times more likely to be wiped out than non-sovereign towns in the same type of terrain. And when compared to the U.S. average, they're about 3.5 times more likely to suffer a major disaster. Even after accounting for natural risks like mountains, floodplains, and wildfire zones, only about 1.5x to 2.3x of that increased risk can be explained by geography alone. That means roughly 30% to 35% of the excess destruction remains unexplained by nature — leaving room for possibilities like policy neglect, strategic land removal, underfunded response, or manmade influence (including the possibility of weather manipulation). The key takeaway is this: sovereign-minded, independent towns make up a very small portion of the U.S. but represent the majority of town-level disasters. Other towns in similar terrain aren't being hit anywhere near as often. These communities, which often reject federal control and choose self-reliance, are being destroyed far more frequently than random chance would allow. That's not a coincidence. That's a pattern. And most of that pattern cannot be explained by nature alone. All the blue states hit by recent flooding—Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and parts of Illinois and Virginia—share more than just their politics. They are all strategically important for other reasons that align with smart cities and Agenda 2030 goals. These states are mostly coastal or near major waterways, which makes them crucial for trade, shipping, and military logistics. They also hold key financial, energy, and infrastructure hubs. For example, Boston, Baltimore, and Chicago are central to finance, transportation, and data. These areas are deeply tied into the green energy push—like offshore wind, carbon tracking, and electric grid modernization—making them testbeds or flagship zones for climate policy and smart city tech. They're also population-dense and rely heavily on controlled infrastructure like public transit, smart grids, and high-tech water management. If someone wanted to slow down or reset parts of the Agenda 2030 rollout—or even use disaster to justify rapid implementation—flooding these zones creates the perfect storm. It disrupts systems, forces rebuilds under federal or international guidelines, and creates media-friendly chaos that can be used to push policy shifts. These aren't random places—they're high-value targets in the shift toward centralized, tech-driven urban control.

These states are mostly coastal or near major waterways, which makes them crucial for trade, shipping, and military logistics. They also hold key financial, energy, and infrastructure hubs. For example, Boston, Baltimore, and Chicago are central to finance, transportation, and data. These areas are deeply tied into the green energy push—like offshore wind, carbon tracking, and electric grid modernization—making them testbeds or flagship zones for climate policy and smart city tech. They're also population-dense and rely heavily on controlled infrastructure like public transit, smart grids, and high-tech water management. If someone wanted to slow down or reset parts of the Agenda 2030 rollout—or even use disaster to justify rapid implementation—flooding these zones creates the perfect storm. It disrupts systems, forces rebuilds under federal or international guidelines, and creates media-friendly chaos that can be used to push policy shifts.

If you do your research even the blue states that got hit either both signed into the smart city plans, or are extremely important to our economy. This is a breakdown of how certain types of American towns — specifically sovereign-minded, independent, rural communities — have been disproportionately hit by major natural disasters between 2000 and 2025. These towns are usually small, generational, located in mountainous or forested areas, and known for resisting federal policies like zoning laws, FEMA control, government mandates, and land buyouts. They represent only about 2.5% of all towns in the United States and about 4.2% of the population, yet they account for roughly 68% of all town-level disasters in that 25-year span. There are around 7,000 of these towns in the U.S., and only 13 were completely or mostly destroyed by wildfire, flood, or similar events. That may seem small, but compared to the 28,000 other rural towns in similar mountainous or high-risk geography that were not culturally sovereign or resistant, only 4 were hit during that same period. The remaining 250,000+ towns and cities — mostly suburban and urban — account for just 2 or 3 major town-level disasters in 25 years. Statistically, sovereign towns are around 13.6 times more likely to be wiped out than non-sovereign towns in the same type of terrain. And when compared to the U.S. average, they're about 3.5 times more likely to suffer a major disaster. Even after accounting for natural risks like mountains, floodplains, and wildfire zones, only about 1.5x to 2.3x of that increased risk can be explained by geography alone. That means roughly 30% to 35% of the excess destruction remains unexplained by nature — leaving room for possibilities like policy neglect, strategic land removal, underfunded response, or manmade influence (including the possibility of weather manipulation). The key takeaway is this: sovereign-minded, independent towns make up a very small portion of the U.S. but represent the majority of town-level disasters. Other towns in similar terrain aren't being hit anywhere near as often. These communities, which often reject federal control and choose self-reliance, are being destroyed far more frequently than random chance would allow. That's not a coincidence. That's a pattern. And most of that pattern cannot be explained by nature alone.

These towns are usually small, generational, located in mountainous or forested areas, and known for resisting federal policies like zoning laws, FEMA control, government mandates, and land buyouts. They represent only about 2.5% of all towns in the United States and about 4.2% of the population, yet they account for roughly 68% of all town-level disasters in that 25-year span. There are around 7,000 of these towns in the U.S., and only 13 were completely or mostly destroyed by wildfire, flood, or similar events. That may seem small, but compared to the 28,000 other rural towns in similar mountainous or high-risk geography that were not culturally sovereign or resistant, only 4 were hit during that same period. The remaining 250,000+ towns and cities — mostly suburban and urban — account for just 2 or 3 major town-level disasters in 25 years. Statistically, sovereign towns are around 13.6 times more likely to be wiped out than non-sovereign towns in the same type of terrain. And when compared to the U.S. average, they're about 3.5 times more likely to suffer a major disaster. Even after accounting for natural risks like mountains, floodplains, and wildfire zones, only about 1.5x to 2.3x of that increased risk can be explained by geography alone. That means roughly 30% to 35% of the excess destruction remains unexplained by nature — leaving room for possibilities like policy neglect, strategic land removal, underfunded response, or manmade influence (including the possibility of weather manipulation). The key takeaway is this: sovereign-minded, independent towns make up a very small portion of the U.S. but represent the majority of town-level disasters. Other towns in similar terrain aren't being hit anywhere near as often. These communities, which often reject federal control and choose self-reliance, are being destroyed far more frequently than random chance would allow. That's not a coincidence. That's a pattern. And most of that pattern cannot be explained by nature alone. All the blue states hit by recent flooding—Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and parts of Illinois and Virginia—share more than just their politics. They are all strategically important for other reasons that align with smart cities and Agenda 2030 goals. These states are mostly coastal or near major waterways, which makes them crucial for trade, shipping, and military logistics. They also hold key financial, energy, and infrastructure hubs. For example, Boston, Baltimore, and Chicago are central to finance, transportation, and data. These areas are deeply tied into the green energy push—like offshore wind, carbon tracking, and electric grid modernization—making them testbeds or flagship zones for climate policy and smart city tech. They're also population-dense and rely heavily on controlled infrastructure like public transit, smart grids, and high-tech water management. If someone wanted to slow down or reset parts of the Agenda 2030 rollout—or even use disaster to justify rapid implementation—flooding these zones creates the perfect storm. It disrupts systems, forces rebuilds under federal or international guidelines, and creates media-friendly chaos that can be used to push policy shifts. These aren't random places—they're high-value targets in the shift toward centralized, tech-driven urban control.

If you do your research even the blue states that got hit either both signed into the smart city plans, or are extremely important to our economy. This is a breakdown of how certain types of American towns — specifically sovereign-minded, independent, rural communities — have been disproportionately hit by major natural disasters between 2000 and 2025. These towns are usually small, generational, located in mountainous or forested areas, and known for resisting federal policies like zoning laws, FEMA control, government mandates, and land buyouts. They represent only about 2.5% of all towns in the United States and about 4.2% of the population, yet they account for roughly 68% of all town-level disasters in that 25-year span. There are around 7,000 of these towns in the U.S., and only 13 were completely or mostly destroyed by wildfire, flood, or similar events. That may seem small, but compared to the 28,000 other rural towns in similar mountainous or high-risk geography that were not culturally sovereign or resistant, only 4 were hit during that same period. The remaining 250,000+ towns and cities — mostly suburban and urban — account for just 2 or 3 major town-level disasters in 25 years. Statistically, sovereign towns are around 13.6 times more likely to be wiped out than non-sovereign towns in the same type of terrain. And when compared to the U.S. average, they're about 3.5 times more likely to suffer a major disaster. Even after accounting for natural risks like mountains, floodplains, and wildfire zones, only about 1.5x to 2.3x of that increased risk can be explained by geography alone. That means roughly 30% to 35% of the excess destruction remains unexplained by nature — leaving room for possibilities like policy neglect, strategic land removal, underfunded response, or manmade influence (including the possibility of weather manipulation). The key takeaway is this: sovereign-minded, independent towns make up a very small portion of the U.S. but represent the majority of town-level disasters. Other towns in similar terrain aren't being hit anywhere near as often. These communities, which often reject federal control and choose self-reliance, are being destroyed far more frequently than random chance would allow. That's not a coincidence. That's a pattern. And most of that pattern cannot be explained by nature alone. All the blue states hit by recent flooding—Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maryland, and parts of Illinois and Virginia—share more than just their politics. They are all strategically important for other reasons that align with smart cities and Agenda 2030 goals. These states are mostly coastal or near major waterways, which makes them crucial for trade, shipping, and military logistics. They also hold key financial, energy, and infrastructure hubs. For example, Boston, Baltimore, and Chicago are central to finance, transportation, and data. These areas are deeply tied into the green energy push—like offshore wind, carbon tracking, and electric grid modernization—making them testbeds or flagship zones for climate policy and smart city tech. They're also population-dense and rely heavily on controlled infrastructure like public transit, smart grids, and high-tech water management. If someone wanted to slow down or reset parts of the Agenda 2030 rollout—or even use disaster to justify rapid implementation—flooding these zones creates the perfect storm. It disrupts systems, forces rebuilds under federal or international guidelines, and creates media-friendly chaos that can be used to push policy shifts. These aren't random places—they're high-value targets in the shift toward centralized, tech-driven urban control.

The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. (Please see below for a detailed listing of the companies and ratings.) The ratings reflect ND Union's balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM). The ratings reflect the consolidation of the members of Norfolk  Dedham Group Pool (Norfolk  Dedham) and the members of Union Mutual of Vermont Companies (Union Mutual) following the groups entering into an affiliation agreement on Nov. 5, 2024, following regulatory approval, as well as adding Union Mutual Fire Insurance Company to an existing pooling agreement between the members of Norfolk  Dedham effective Jan. 1, 2025. New England Guaranty Insurance Company and Community Mutual Insurance Company continue to participate in 100% quota share reinsurance agreements with Union Mutual Fire Insurance Company and receive reinsured ratings. The new group (ND Union) consisting of the members of Norfolk  Dedham and Union Mutual is based on explicit support including the pooling agreement and the implementation of a catastrophe reinsurance program effective July 1, 2025, for all members. Implicit support includes the integration of various functions including Finance, Actuarial and IT Security, as well as the combined branding and communications of both Norfolk  Dedham and Union Mutual. The Norfolk  Dedham companies continue to be headquartered in Dedham, MA, while the Union Mutual companies continue to be headquartered in Montpelier, VT. Joel Murray is the President  Chief Executive Officer of the Norfolk  Dedham companies and the Chair of the integrated Board of ND Union. Lisa Keysar is the President  Chief Executive Officer of the Union Mutual companies and a Union Board member. ND Union's very strong balance sheet is based on the group's strongest risk-adjusted capitalization as measured by Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR). Balance sheet strength is further supported by a strong liquidity position, modest underwriting leverage and a conservative investment risk profile. Substantial capital protection is provided through a comprehensive reinsurance program. ND Union's operating performance of adequate is based on solid underwriting results and operating performance over the most recent five-year period, as demonstrated by its five-year average combined and operating ratios, which both compare favorably to the industry composite. The five-year average combined ratio is driven by a below average loss and loss adjustment expense ratio, which is partially offset by an above average underwriting expense ratio, largely related to higher commission costs typical of New England writers. ND Union's business profile of neutral is based on its well-established market presence in its operating territories, predominantly Massachusetts, with extensive knowledge of local, regulatory and legislative insurance issues. Personal and commercial line products are also written in New York, New Jersey, Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, Rhode Island and Connecticut. Geographic spread has been enhanced to a broader area in the Northeast due to the recent affiliation. Products are distributed through independent agents that are regularly monitored and evaluated for business development, mix and profitability. ND Union has developed an appropriate ERM program that supports its risk profile. The group's Chief Executive Officers act as the chief risk officers in charge of overseeing ERM.

Anti-Trump protests continue to rage in the United States as a group of organizations have banded together to announce plans to hold a protest movement in honor of former Congressman John Lewis' five-year death anniversary. The movement is being called the 'Good Trouble Lives On' protest. The movement is primarily being organized by the Transformative Justice Coalition, Black Voters Matter, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, League of Women Voters, the Declaration for American Democracy Coalition, and Mi Familia en Acción, in coalition with a few other groups. Why are protest movements being held? “The Trump administration's recent escalating authoritarian actions, attacks on DEI initiatives and voting rights, and dismantling of government agencies have raised alarm bells for democracy advocates, and that's why we're mobilizing,” reads an official press release issued by the organizers. “Organizers hope to build on the momentum from the historic “No Kings” mass mobilization on June 14, the largest demonstration to take place in Trump's second term with over 2,100 events spanning across all 50 states. We will take to the streets, courthouses, and community spaces to carry forward his fight for justice, voting rights, and dignity for all.” When and where are protests taking place?

An estimated $25 million in grant funding is being withheld from Maine public schools for six programs supporting teacher development, adult literacy, after-school programs and more. In an email, the U.S. Department of Education said the funds were in review to “ensure resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities.” The complaint was filed in Rhode Island district court and says the decision was unlawful and has caused chaos across educational systems. School districts say the delay will prevent them from finalizing their budgets by the beginning of their fiscal year. This story appears through a media partnership with Maine Public.

tw_sl_e855e8ff0c7fe88caf531b00be922065,2025-07-16 12:58:10,en,WEB,"  The Partnership for Rhode Island has landed its next executive director. Elizabeth Catucci, who spent six years as president and CEO of the Northern Rhode Island Chamber of Commerce, will take the helm of the nonprofit business group, which includes many of the state's top CEOs, starting in September. Catucci succeeds founding executive director Tom Giordano, who stepped down in April to become vice president of external affairs at FM Global (whose CEO is a Partnership member). “Liz Catucci has built a strong reputation across Rhode Island as an effective advocate and voice for business,” Brown University Health CEO and Partnership Board Chairman John Fernandez said. “Liz is the right leader for our organization as we look to be more highly involved in business attraction.” The bigger picture: For the Partnership, it's a savvy hire after an extensive search. Catucci is one of the rare people within Rhode Island's political and business circles who is widely respected and well-liked. As the state heads into what is certain to be a contentious election year, she has the ear of Governor Dan McKee, the trust of General Assembly leaders, and credibility with both small and large businesses statewide. The Partnership has played a behind-the-scenes role in several major policy initiatives in Rhode Island in recent years – it funded the Johns Hopkins University study that led to the state takeover of Providence schools – and was the lead funder of CompeteRI, which has helped governments across Rhode Island secure more than $700 million in federal grants in recent years. With federal funds drying up, the Partnership now wants to pivot to business development/recruitment in the state, which may include more advocacy at the State House than it has shown in the past. Catucci's experience at the Chamber will be an asset.

mov_71A49C8BE70464F0E70A34BDBFFF24C8,2025-07-16 13:02:27,en,WEB,"  OAK RIDGE, Tenn. – Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. Recommended Videos President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget. Working to 'amp up' domestic nuclear fuel production Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy. There's little of it made in the United States right now. Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation's first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors. A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to “amp up” domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department. At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity — if the right actions are taken now...."

mov_D7F02E29F814962021BB7A1EEB7F38B1,2025-07-16 13:02:27,en,WEB,"  OAK RIDGE, Tenn. – Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. Recommended Videos President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget.

(AP) — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble.

They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget. Working to 'amp up' domestic nuclear fuel production Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy. There's little of it made in the United States right now. Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation's first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors.

(AP) — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor.

In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget. Working to 'amp up' domestic nuclear fuel production Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy. There's little of it made in the United States right now. Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation's first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors. A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to “amp up” domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department. At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity — if the right actions are taken now.

Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. Article continues below this ad But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing.

Article continues below this ad X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. Article continues below this ad The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years.

(AP) — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever.

(AP) — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency.

Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget. Working to 'amp up' domestic nuclear fuel production Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy. There's little of it made in the United States right now. Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation's first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors.

(AP) — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century.

In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget. Working to 'amp up' domestic nuclear fuel production Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy. There's little of it made in the United States right now. Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation's first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors. A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to “amp up” domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department. At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity — if the right actions are taken now.

(AP) — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls.

(AP) — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget. Working to 'amp up' domestic nuclear fuel production Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy. There's little of it made in the United States right now. Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation's first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors. A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to “amp up” domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department.

(AP) — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said.

Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget. Working to 'amp up' domestic nuclear fuel production Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy. There's little of it made in the United States right now. Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation's first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors. A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to “amp up” domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department. At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity — if the right actions are taken now. X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell said he hopes to help solve the fuel problem so it doesn't hold back new reactor development...."

mov_C0F6108AE0EB92FE0B4DA8F927CDE0C3,2025-07-16 13:03:00,en,WEB,"  OAK RIDGE, Tenn. — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst.

Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget. Working to 'amp up' domestic nuclear fuel production Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy. There's little of it made in the United States right now. Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation's first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors. A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to “amp up” domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department. At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity — if the right actions are taken now. X-energy CEO J. Clay Sell said he hopes to help solve the fuel problem so it doesn't hold back new reactor development...."

Also for the first time in 20 years, last month we had a 27 billion dollar surplus in regards to our Trading economy. #SoaringEagle #FAFO #ManoftheCentury #Trump2.0 #DiplomatinChief #Daddy47 #America250 Patriotism  and common sense are back!! We are finally getting back to fiscal responsibility and Sanity in Washington DC under President trump. I said it before and I'll say it again. God put him in this place for a reason. Let's not forget Americans I've gotten sick and tired the Democrat socialist lunacy and destruction of his country. July 2025. 4.1% unemployment. Just broker to trade deal with vietnam. He also helped negotiate peace talks between Rwanda and the Congo who have been at War for 30 plus years. Lowest gas prices since early 2021. May 2025 president Trump visit several countries in the Middle East. He builds alliances and secures business Partnerships to the tune of 10 trillion dollars of private Investments coming to the United States from countries we never thought we could be business partners with. Wait a minute. I thought people told us that President Trump was going to do nothing but start World War 3 and endanger our standing on the world stage? Politico, CNN pundits and even Axios are reporting the wonderful things president Trump did on his Middle East trip. April 2025. Real wages up by 3.8%. Mortgage interest rates are below 6% for the first time in several years. Inflation is on its way down from Joe Biden's 40-year High. We are delivering lean results, not RED TAPE  in bringing back government efficiency. March 2025 president Trump attends a wrestling event at the Wells Fargo center. The crowd starts chanting USA. USA. USA!! Patriotism is here to stay for many decades. Not since JFK has a president been loved and revered like President Trump. #SpeedofTrump #LefthasLeftAmerica #FAFO Copied from another post: It was a MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN week in America! United States stock market at an all-time high!! Hyundai Corporation investing $20 billion in America Manufacturing. Johnson & Johnson is planning a $55 billion investment to increase manufacturing in the US. The UAE is investing $1.4 TRILLION in US industry and manufacturing after meeting with President Trump. President Trump announced the next generation of American fighter jet. It is going to be called the ""F-47""!!

Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as ""pebbles."" Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times.

mov_5E61BA0C9F0AE61C2172AB0152D6078C,2025-07-16 13:06:16,en,WEB,"  OAK RIDGE, Tenn. — (AP) — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as ""pebbles."" Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget. Working to 'amp up' domestic nuclear fuel production Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy.

(AP) — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs.

At one point, during my transformation from Dr. Jekyll to Mr. Hyde, my mom tearfully suggested that we should just scrap the move and move everything back to Greenbrier. Naturally, being the forward thinking entrepeneur that I am, I said no because at Going the Distance, we don't go backwards, we go forwards. Now, you might be wondering why I bring this up. Well, because sometimes God has plans for us and will often know well ahead of time of when that moment comes. Take for example the moment King Herod the Great ordered all baby boys in Bethlehem to be killed in an effort to kill the Baby Jesus. Jesus' earthly father, St. Joseph, was awakened by the sounds of God telling him that he must take his wife St. Mary and the Baby Jesus to Egypt because Herod is seeking to destroy him. In that case, they had no advanced warning and had to pack up and move out at a fast pace. With only a few loaves of bread and the clothes on their back, they fled Bethlehem and headed towards Egypt, remaining there until Herod was dead. ...                   Now, you might be wondering why I bring up the story of Jesus and his family hastily leaving Bethlehem for this blog. That is because a mere 10 days after I left Greenbrier for the last time, on June 25th, 2025, a 2 alarm fire broke out at my former building. 3 people (a firefighter, a police officer and a resident) were taken to over to Rhode Island Hospital to be treated for smoke inhalation and burns. What's more was that the fire was focused around the area where my old apartment was and it made me go into deep reflection had we stopped the move and I continued living at Greenbrier. The fire tore through the stairwell next to me and some of it even burned through some of the shingles where my DVD shelf was placed. Not to mention also that there was also a lot of smoke damage and tons of water damage from the sprinkler system that was quickly activated. Of course, had I been there at the time, there was no doubt in my mind that the panic attacks would have gone through the roof not to mention the sights and sounds of the moment would have been playing over and over again from the fire alarm blaring, the sounds of police and fire screaming at me to get out of the apartment as well as the feeling of extreme heat from the fires. Then, there was also the matter that I could have lost most of my possessions had the fire spread quickly. In other words, my sensory processing disorder would have kicked into overdrive to the point where I could have gone to the hospital as well for mental health reasons. Some possessions that I have are of sentimental value and it would have been devastating had I lost them. ...     In fact, part of the reason why I left Greenbrier was because the property wasn't properly managed. People just didn't seem to care and felt they could do whatever they wanted (smoke close to the buildings, leave trash on the ground next to the dumpster and ownership would raise rents every year). In addition, there was also a lot of development and construction going on Route 6 in Seekonk (such as the addition of a TownePlace Suites by Marriott hotel, a Whole Foods and the closure of the Showcase Cinemas to make room for a Market Basket)  that would make someone not want to live at a place like Greenbrier, not to mention the traffic which is only going to get worse before it gets better. Looking back now, I feel as if I was far too good for Greenbrier and that the fire was a sign that I needed to get away and start living in a neighborhood where I'm respected and can talk to the neighbors. Whereas most of the neighbors at Greenbrier weren't really my kind of people to hang around with. Here, I have more space for my items, an office where I conduct business matters related to Going the Distance and also be between Boston and Providence, thus giving me access to their two airports, TF Green and Logan. Perhaps it's also simply because it was the passing of the years and the end of an era at Greenbrier and living full time in Seekonk for that matter. Seekonk had come a long way from when I lived my entire life. At Going the Distance, change is sometimes the only way for things to grow and Going the Distance is growing more and more. Perhaps it was fate, maybe it was a sign, but either way, getting out before the fires happened was probably one of the smartest decisions that I made. The fire was also perhaps a sign that the old era was over for Going the Distance and a new era has now begun here in Attleboro. There are many exciting things happening at Going the Distance that will come in due time, but sometimes giving 7 weeks worth of your time is necessary in order to achieve that goal. The June 25th fire would have sent Going the Distance upside down as well as myself, but it didn't, and that's something that I am deeply grateful for. ...     Catch you all later!!"

The Supreme Court's decision to temporarily allow mass layoffs at the Education Department marked the latest in a string of rulings from the high court green-lighting the president's plans to scale down the size of the federal workforce. Permitting the termination of about 1,400 Education Department employees is one of several instances of the Supreme Court showing significant deference to Trump's power over the executive branch. In other cases, the high court has preliminarily approved of Trump's executive order calling for sweeping federal job cuts and shown an openness to the president diminishing the independence of some agencies. Often these decisions, issued on an emergency basis at the request of the Trump administration, have come with little explanation. The high court did not, for example, spell out why it allowed Trump to carry out mass layoffs at the Education Department. But the move advances the president's long-term efforts to dismantle the department, for now. South Texas College law professor Joshua Blackman said the plaintiffs' argument that Congress needs to approve such a drastic change to an agency did not appear persuasive to the high court. SUPREME COURT RULES ON TRUMP'S MASS LAYOFFS AT EDUCATION DEPARTMENT ""I think they're basically saying, 'We don't think this is trying to restructure the agency,'"" Blackman told Fox News Digital. ""Justices Jackson and Sotomayor sort of made that point in the dissent, but I don't think it's resonating with the majority."" Blackman noted that even though these shadow docket decisions are temporary while the lawsuits proceed in the lower courts, they have lasting power. Litigation can take two or three years, and employees who lose their jobs are likely not waiting around for that long to return to the government, he said. He also said those employees are not ""in theory, at least,"" suffering irreparable harm because ""reinstatements with back pay is an option."" Irreparable harm is a criterion judges consider before issuing emergency orders. Another Trump-friendly ruling Last week, the Supreme Court temporarily reversed Judge Susan Illston's order blocking the administration from acting on Trump's executive order to reduce the workforce. ""The President has the authority to seek changes to executive branch agencies, but he must do so in lawful ways and, in the case of large-scale reorganizations, with the cooperation of the legislative branch,"" Illston, a Clinton-appointed judge based in California, wrote. 'IT WILL HAPPEN QUICKLY': STATE DEPT POISED TO ACT AFTER SUPREME COURT GREEN-LIGHTS AGENCY LAYOFFS Trump signed an executive order after he took office announcing a sweeping ""reduction in force"" initiative. To carry out Trump's order, the Office of Management and Budget and the Office of Personnel Management sent a directive to the heads of government agencies in February to craft plans to eliminate jobs. ""Agencies should focus on the maximum elimination of functions that are not statutorily mandated while driving the highest-quality, most efficient delivery of their statutorily required functions,"" the memo said. A group of labor organizations and nonprofits sued, arguing a mass reorganization of government required congressional approval. Last week, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 against them by pausing Illston's injunction. Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan sided with the conservative majority, which found that the executive order and memo are lawful. The majority noted that the decision is not a reflection of the justices' opinions on agency-specific firings and that those should be examined as a separate matter. Jonathan Turley, a George Washington University law professor, told ""Fox & Friends"" the high court was sending a ""clear"" message about judicial overreach. ""This is another shot across the bow to lower courts that they've got to knock this off,"" Turley said. ""They've got to stop with these injunctions. This is six months of delay. It could've been much longer, and the court is signaling, 'We're going to be on you very quickly if you continue to do these types of orders.'"" Pending layoffs The decision empowered Secretary of State Marco Rubio to lay off more than 1,300 State Department workers. Since Trump took office, tens of thousands of federal employees have accepted buyout offers from the administration or been let go. But many other layoffs are still wrapped up in lawsuits. Some firing decisions remain pending because of district court judges' orders. In some cases, the Trump administration has argued that the Supreme Court's recent move to do away with universal injunctions is reason enough for those judges to reverse course. In one lawsuit, Democratic-led states sued over Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr.'s move to terminate about 10,000 employees. Judge Melissa DuBose, a Biden appointee based in Rhode Island, sided with the states and blocked the terminations. The judge must now decide if her injunction is at odds with the Supreme Court's new ruling on universal injunctions. Humphrey's Executor The government downsizing coincides with the president's controversial decision to fire several watchdogs and members of independent agencies without cause. In May, the Supreme Court sided with Trump on two of the firings, fueling speculation that the high court is aiming to overturn a 90-year precedent set in Humphrey's Executor v. United States. That decision found that President Franklin D. Roosevelt could not fire a member of the Federal Trade Commission without a reason, such as neglect of job duties or malfeasance, because it conflicted with a law Congress passed that established the commission. SUPREME COURT LETS TRUMP'S 'WRECKING BALL' FEDERAL JOB CUTS PROCEED WHILE LEGAL FIGHT CONTINUES In Trump's case, the Supreme Court temporarily approved two firings involving the heads of the National Labor Relations Board and Merit Systems Protection Board. The high court's order was unsigned but indicated that the three liberal justices dissented. ""Because the Constitution vests the executive power in the President… he may remove without cause executive officers who exercise that power on his behalf, subject to narrow exceptions recognized by our precedents,"" the order read. The Supreme Court's decision was a boon to Trump's implementation of the unitary executive theory, a legal concept that emphasizes presidential control...."

n3gcptk,2025-07-16 14:38:03,en,REDDIT,"  I could tell so many stories about my former in-laws, but I'd have to make several throwaway accounts because no one would believe that so many just-nos can exist within one family. I don't remember which sub it was, but I commented about how my then 30 year old BIL asked my ex and I to babysit his kids so he could go to his girlfriend's high school graduation, and it got removed and a mod messaged me to practice my creative writing elsewhere. Oh, and the girlfriend was pregnant with BIL's 4th child, and she was baby mama number 4. To give you a better visual of my former MIL, she dressed like Larry the cable guy, but with crocs instead of work boots, and her entire personality was based on being ""southern"" despite being born and raised in Rhode Island. Also, this is Virginia, but she insisted that we were living in the ""deep south."" She talked with an obviously fake exaggerated southern hick accent, like Ellie Mae Clampet would sound natural compared to her. After a couple of incidents, I refused to go out in public with her because she was always keeping her eye peeled for a loose tile or oversized end cap display that she could trip and sue for. She even bragged about how easy it was to get a payout from a rite aid because she had it ""on record"" that she called and complained about an area of loose carpet a week or so before she ""tripped,"" so there was proof that they knew about the ""hazard"" and didn't fix it. Whenever she ""tripped,"" she'd throw her arm across her forehead like a Victorian lady with the vapors, kick one leg up, then kinda crumple to the floor, but always land on her ass, and then through fake, tearless sobs, with her dumb accent, cry out something  like ""oh dang dagnabbit! I reckon I done dinged up my bad knee! Oh dear heavens! The pain is unbearable!"" Oh, and my neck hurts too! "" Then hobble over to fill out an incident report. She was on Medicaid, so she had zero copays, but her M.O. was to have someone drive her to the hospital, where she'd be given a neck brace and ace bandage for whichever joint was allegedly ""dislocated,"" request an itemized list of what was done (xray, CT, etc) with the prices of what they cost without insurance, then hobble back to the store the next day demanding reimbursement. For the most part, she was successful, but a lot of places offered the payout with the condition that she would be henceforth banned from the business and would face legal consequences should she hobble foot in the store again. We live in bumfuct nowhere, the nearest gas station is 20 minutes away, and it's another 10 minutes to the next one, but she ran out of gas stations within a 30-mile radius, and her lifted pickup only got around 11 miles to the gallon, so that really bit her in the ass. She also had no qualms about applying to charities she didn't qualify for and called me ""uppity"" when I refused to participate with her in ripping off a charity I technically qualified for, but was not in need of. She also tried to get me to sign up for government assistance, which I also technically qualified for, but being that I was still getting tremendous help from my parents, I felt it would be unethical to apply and would basically be stealing from someone underprivileged. Our parents hadn't even met at this point, but upon hearing that they were helping us out so much,* that heifer had the audacity to ask me to ask my parents to loan her some money she ""only needed about $20,000 to catch up and have some breathing room."" And actually said that it was only fair that I asked them to help her out because she didn't have any parents to turn to. *we lived with my parents for a couple of months before our wedding. Long story short; his parents were pissed off about me not being 100% white, and my ex said, ""If my girl ain't welcomed, then neither am I."" He paid most of their bills when he lived at home, and they magically became colorblind once they realized he wasn't gonna continue paying after he moved out, nor would he consider helping them out financially ever again unless they apologized and fully accepted me. My ex was a manipulative and emotionally abusive prick, but I give him props for standing up for me."

Key Highlights INL named chief digital officer for SMART USA semiconductor program Lab to apply digital twin tech to boost chip production INL to lead workforce development in the Mountain West (IDAHO FALLS, Idaho) – The Idaho National Laboratory (INL) has been chosen to serve as the chief digital officer for the Semiconductor Manufacturing and Advanced Research with Twins USA Institute (SMART USA). This Manufacturing USA Institute, funded by the National Institute for Standards and Technology CHIPS for America program and launched in 2025, is led by Semiconductor Research Corporation Manufacturing Consortium Corporation. The SMART USA program is partnering with the Department of Energy to tackle the semiconductor industry's toughest challenges, leveraging the department's decades-long investments in high-performance computing. This initiative will advance American digital twin technology, build a digital backbone, and apply it to the semiconductor supply chain to reboot domestic manufacturing competitiveness and ensure economic and national security. “INL was selected for its vast expertise in digital twinning, high-performance computing, digital engineering, artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing,” said Chris Ritter, INL's division director of Scientific Computing and AI, who will lead INL's part of the effort. “We will also be in charge of developing tools and methodologies to provide agile responses to supply chain disruptions, ensuring continuous and efficient semiconductor production.” As the electronics industry grows, efficient and secure semiconductor manufacturing will become more vital. SMART USA and INL will employ digital twin technology to reduce the significant time and costs associated with chip design and production. A digital twin is like a virtual copy of something real, such as a machine, building or even a whole system. This virtual version is constantly updated with data from the real thing, allowing it to predict what might happen and help make better decisions. Essentially, it's a high-tech way to monitor and improve real-world objects and systems. With years of experience in developing digital twin technology, INL is positioned to lead this initiative. INL computer scientists have created digital twin initiatives across key focus areas: Nuclear operations, energy systems, advanced materials, fuel cycles and cyber-physical security. These include the AGN-201 digital twin, the first digital twin of an operating nuclear reactor. INL developed the AGN-201 twin in partnership with Idaho State University, where the physical reactor is located. The twin receives live data and allows the digital users to detect when nuclear reactor operators make changes or adjustments to the real-world 5-watt reactor. Additionally, INL will lead the Rocky Mountain region's Digital Innovation Semiconductor Centers. In this role, the lab will work with Boise State University, the College of Eastern Idaho, the University of Utah, other regional universities, Mountain West-based semiconductor companies like Micron and Texas Instruments, and nearby national laboratories such as the National Renewable Energy Laboratory to build a highly-skilled semiconductor workforce across the region. “We are thrilled to embark on this exciting partnership with Idaho National Lab. Collaborating with Chris Ritter and the team at INL opens up incredible opportunities for innovation and advancement in our field,” said Todd Younkin, executive director for the SMART USA Institute and president and CEO of Semiconductor Research Corporation. “INL's pioneering work in digital twins, which integrate physical assets with computational capabilities, is set to revolutionize semiconductor manufacturing.” A crucial part of this new project's scope is to bolster domestic manufacturing competitiveness to secure economic and national security interests, with the overarching goal of returning semiconductor manufacturing to American soil. INL's leadership ensures that the Mountain West Region will be at the forefront of these new technological innovations and the growing workforce and opportunities the semiconductor industry will bring.

An American man who vanished weeks ago in Turks and Caicos is still presumed missing, despite the fact that a decomposing male body was found in the island paradise 10 days ago. Brian Tarrence, a 51-year-old business executive from Monroe, New York , went missing in the early hours of June 25 after leaving his rental condo, according to a Facebook post from the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force. He was vacationing with his wife Maria at the time. On the same day, a security guard was killed by a “masked gunman” outside a supermarket about nine miles from where Tarrence went missing. No connection between the alleged homicide and Tarrence's disappearance has been made. Tarrence, who recently moved from Monroe to Manhattan, arrived in Turks and Caicos with his wife of one year on June 22, and they planned to leave on June 29. (Facebook) MYSTERY DEEPENS AS BODY DISCOVERED DURING SEARCH FOR MISSING AMERICAN IN ISLAND PARADISE Search and rescue forces were deployed on July 5, and three hours into the search, the body of a deceased male “in a decomposed state” was found in Grace Bay, Providenciales, the same town where Tarrence and his wife were staying. According to CBS News, the body of the decomposed male has not been identified since it was found on July 5. Fox News Digital reached out to the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force on Wednesday morning, but did not hear back. Brian Tarrence, 51, was last seen leaving his condo around 3:30 a.m. at the Paradise Inn in Grace Bay, Providenciales, Turks and Caicos, according to a missing persons flyer from the Royal Turks and Caicos Islands Police Force.

mov_685C23C0D223C2331CF136ECC1AD45F7,2025-07-16 15:46:00,en,WEB,"  This story was originally published by The Institute for Public Service Reporting -- Memphis. Health care providers across Tennessee are scrambling to find new funding for HIV prevention following the loss of a critical federal grant. Tennessee lost the funding earlier this spring amid deep spending cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. United Way of Greater Nashville, the organization that directs federal HIV funding to nonprofits and health care agencies across the state, told the Institute for Public Service Reporting its CDC agreement ""expired"" on the last day of May. That funding, totaling $4 million, represents roughly half of all federal dollars spent in Tennessee for HIV prevention and treatment. The cuts are expected to hit especially hard in Memphis, where HIV infection rates are among the highest in the country. ""This moment calls for creativity in how we fund HIV prevention and care at the local level, especially in states that do not have a political appetite for action,"" said Adrian Shanker, a senior official for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services during the Biden administration. The Ryan White program, the federal program that covers HIV treatment and treatment-related needs for people who couldn't otherwise afford them, appears to be left intact. But the cuts are expected to decrease the accessibility of birth control supplies and trigger layoffs of social workers and employees who help people navigate access to PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, a key drug for at-risk individuals that greatly reduces the odds of contracting HIV. The loss of the federal funding comes as Memphis health officials face rising rates of new infections of HIV and syphilis and an uncertain future of disease surveillance at the state and national level. Data shows a steady climb since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when the Shelby County Health Department logged 238 new HIV infections. In 2023, the latest year data is available from both the county and state health departments, that number jumped to 353. This total does not include individuals who may have unknowingly contracted the virus. Rob Bobal, founder of the Memphis nonprofit A Betor Way, which faces a loss of $125,000 a year in funding, said the cuts in prevention funding have implications beyond the spread of HIV. Bobal's nonprofit specializes in harm reduction, providing clean needles and rapid HIV testing for intravenous drug users who may otherwise reuse needles and spread infections. Add to that, Bobal said, the funding cuts often translate to a loss of jobs and an overall weakening of an already under-funded infrastructure of community-based organizations. ""This is scary to me, you know? It just means that categories of people who were already underserved are going to be in a worse situation than they were before,"" Bobal said. ""You take all the CBOs (community-based organizations) out of Memphis ... I don't know what's left."" GREAT UNCERTAINTY Tennessee health care providers had an oral commitment from the CDC under the Biden administration to continue the HIV prevention funding for another year, but discussions abruptly stopped after President Donald Trump took office in January, according to people familiar with the matter who asked to remain anonymous to discuss sensitive information. The CDC later initiated procedures to close-out and discontinue the grant, these people said. As funding sources for sexual and reproductive health continue to dry up, upheaval at the federal level adds another layer of complication for HIV surveillance, prevention and treatment. Since Trump took office in January, HHS has discontinued research into a promising vaccine for HIV, just months before trials were to start. The federal entity, which houses the CDC, also is hurriedly rehiring hundreds of workers fired earlier this spring under the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, which was overseen for a time by billionaire Elon Musk. The disruptions are ""not insignificant,"" Shanker said. ""There was a light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak,"" he said. ""These are setbacks that that will require massive investments from non-governmental sources, just to stay close to being on track to where we were before. And that's really, really challenging."" The challenges will trickle down. In Shelby County, when a person receives a positive result on an HIV test, regardless of where they are tested, they are told to contact anyone they have had intercourse with within the past year. Positive test results are also reported to the health department, where staff contact tracers work to contact any at-risk individuals associated with the positive test. The positive test result then goes on a journey. If a person is tested at a community organization or a health care office, results are reported to the county health department. From there, the numbers are sent to the state health department, where the data is compiled. Often preliminary data -- data that is still being analyzed and verified -- is the closest the public can get to the most recent information about how HIV is spreading. The latest data available from both the state and county stops in 2023. Information gathered locally about new HIV infections is collected by the CDC's National HIV Surveillance System. However, that system was disrupted this spring when numbers of employees were fired as part of a DOGE-driven restructuring. In all, some 10,000 HHS employees were laid off in March. A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled earlier this month that the layoffs were likely unlawful. It's unclear how that decision may affect the surveillance program. The court ruling aside, the federal government already is rehiring hundreds of previously fired workers, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee on June 24. Even if every fired CDC employee that coordinated federal efforts to contain and eliminate HIV is hired back, the disruption, as Shanker said, is a significant setback. MEMPHIS HIT HARD For cities like Memphis, a national leader in new infection rates, setbacks at the federal level hit especially hard. HIV infection rates prompted Shelby County Health Director Michelle Taylor to sound the alarm over the past year. In February, she met with local hospital leaders and urged the implementation of ""opt out"" testing for HIV for patients treated in emergency rooms, meaning patients would be universally screened for HIV unless they declined the test. Regional One Health, a public hospital that treats historically vulnerable communities, has flagged HIV infections as a priority for years. All patients who are admitted to the hospital are screened for HIV, Angie Golding, the communications director, told The Institute...."

The lawsuit, filed in Rhode Island, seeks to block the Trump administration from withholding the funds. Washington was joined by 21 other states and the District of Columbia. “Student success and well-being is a nonpartisan issue. It's inexcusable that the federal government would choose to wreak havoc on local school systems like this as they prepare for the upcoming school year,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement Monday. “We're fighting for every dollar our students are owed.” According to the Office of the Superintendent of Public Instruction, nearly $137 million in funds previously allocated for K-12 schools for the upcoming academic year have been frozen by the Trump administration. “Diverting funds intended for students and educators that were approved by Congress and signed by President Trump himself, to build a reserve of funds to pay for tax cuts for billionaires, is immoral and illegal,” State Superintendent Chris Reykdal said in a statement. While the funds were set to be distributed on July 1, according to the complaint, states received notification on June 30 that the grants were under review “given the change in Administrations.” “The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities,” the notification states. The lawsuit alleges that the decision to withhold the funds violates Education Department regulations as well as Congress' power to allocate funds. The Attorney General's Office alleges the Department of Education is also withholding $13 million in grants for student support programs at community and technical colleges in the state."

mov_C660FE227BCD9EBA0104D0591AB89813,2025-07-16 16:24:04,en,WEB,"  A coalition of more than 20 U.S. states has taken legal action against the Trump administration, accusing it of unlawfully freezing billions of dollars in federal education funding that supports after-school care, summer learning, and enrichment programs critical to low-income families. At the center of the legal battle are programs like those run by the Boys & Girls Clubs, YMCA, and public schools that serve over 1.4 million children. Congress had earmarked these funds to support students with academic help and childcare, but the Trump administration has halted disbursement, saying the money must align with its current policy goals. California is reportedly leading the lawsuit, which contends the freeze violates both the U.S. Constitution and multiple federal laws. With school years restarting as early as late July in several states, the urgency is mounting. Plaintiffs warn that if funding isn't released immediately, many students, especially those in underserved rural and urban districts, will lose access to essential programs. In Rhode Island, state officials stepped in with emergency funding to keep summer camps running, like the Boys & Girls Club in East Providence. Darleen Reyes, a single mother and state worker, braved a flash flood to bring her son Aiden to camp. “I wanted to see my friends and not just sit at home,” the eight-year-old said before running off to play. But the fall semester looks bleak. Without federal intervention, hundreds of after-school programs may shutter within weeks. Sara Leutzinger, spokesperson for the Boys & Girls Clubs of America, warned that “many of our 926 clubs face closure if this funding isn't restored soon.” The lawsuit also includes states like North Carolina, where officials say the freeze affects dozens of schools already in session. “To now suggest this money needs review because of someone's agenda is deeply troubling,” said Maurice “Mo” Green, North Carolina's superintendent of public education. Republican educators have joined the outcry. Georgia's GOP schools superintendent Richard Woods stated, “I deeply believe in fiscal responsibility, but we must also be responsible stewards—releasing funds already approved by Congress and signed by President Trump.” The freeze impacts federal grants used for mental health services, STEM education, and support for English-language learners. According to analysis from the New America think tank, most of the districts hardest hit are in Republican-led areas. Trump officials claim the freeze is part of a broader review of “left-wing” initiatives, citing services for undocumented immigrants and LGBTQ+ inclusion efforts. But critics argue this review is unjustified, particularly since Congress already allocated the funds in a bill signed by Trump. Christy Gleason of Save the Children, which operates rural after-school programs in 41 schools, stressed that the clock is ticking. “It's not too late to act so the kids who really need this still have it,” she said. For families like Fernande Berard's, whose children attend summer camp while she works as a nurse, the uncertainty is overwhelming. “I'd be devastated if this goes away,” she said. Her husband, an Uber driver, would have to reduce hours, and she might have to bring her kids to the rehab center where she works. And for Reyes, the thought of pulling Aiden out of the program is heartbreaking. Private childcare costs $220 a week, far beyond her reach. Her backup plan is to ask her 14-year-old to babysit, sidelining his dreams of sports and work. “It's hard to imagine,” she said, as she watched her son thrive among tutors and friends. “This place helps him grow. Losing it would be a big loss.”"

One of New Mexico's representatives in Congress says the Trump administration's refusal to release education funding is harming both children and adult students, especially those who are falling behind in reading and mathematics. All three of New Mexico's representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives on July 10 joined approximately 145 other federal lawmakers in a letter asking the Trump administration to immediately lift a freeze on $7 billion meant for student learning and achievement; after-school programs; teacher training; and adult education and literacy. Get stories like this delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up for The 74 Newsletter “There is no legitimate reason why any review of these programs should prevent the Administration from fulfilling its responsibility to the American people on time,” they wrote. “No more excuses — follow the law and release the funding meant for our schools, teachers and families.” Vasquez told Source NM the administration is withholding $44 million from K-12 schools and adult education programs in New Mexico. That includes $21.6 million in his congressional district; $12 million for Albuquerque Public Schools; and approximately $3 million Las Cruces Public Schools, he said. “I was an English learner in the public schools system in this country, and I got to where I was because these programs existed,” Vasquez said in an interview. “We are selling our kids short by eliminating these programs, and most importantly all of those kids who are falling behind in math and reading.” He said school administrators are digging into their budget reserves in an attempt to find solutions. Withholding the money could result in dropped programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential student supports, Stateline reports. “What I got from the Las Cruces superintendent was, if they want to continue these programs, which are extremely valuable to the community, to the families and students alike, that they're going to essentially have to figure out where to make cuts elsewhere within the total budget,” Vasquez said in an interview. “So they're in a rough place right now.” More in U.S. Melanie Blea, executive director of federal and state programs at Albuquerque Public Schools,  told Source that while district leaders have been planning various scenarios for funding cuts, the timing of the administration's funding freeze is a challenge given school starts in one month. The district started planning its budget in December; received approval from their school board in March and April; and received approval from the state in June, she said. “We're doing everything possible to make sure that schools are safe from these cuts, that they don't necessarily feel them,” Blea said. “We're trying to fill holes. We're trying to cover as much as we possibly can with other funds.” The funding freeze affects continuing education for teachers at all 143 APS schools, Blea said, and ancillary staff like nurses and counselors. “We probably can't do this for much longer, as far as insulating schools,” she added. Martin Salazar, communications director for APS, told Source NM that the district is committed to keeping all of its 55 staff who are paid out of the frozen funds employed for the rest of the school year. “If this goes on, and it's the same situation next school year or the following school year, that's going to pose a problem for us,” he said. A voicemail for a spokesperson at Las Cruces Public Schools was not returned as of Monday morning. The Trump administration told state governments it would hold back the funds on June 30, to ensure that public money is “spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities.” The lawmakers' letter is addressed to U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought New Mexico and 15 other states this month sued McMahon's agency over its decision in April to also freeze $1 billion in grant funding, including school-based mental health programs. A spokesperson for Vought's office told the Rhode Island Current that federal school funds were withheld after officials found some districts across the country had allegedly misused the money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda,” including English language instruction for immigrant students, scholarships for undocumented students and a seminar about “queer resistance in the arts.” Vasquez told Source that Trump and other Republicans have been saying their goal in withholding the funding has been to “end free education to undocumented children,” which Vasquez called xenophobic and “a blatant lie” after reviewing the Las Cruces Public Schools budget with Superintendent Ignacio Ruiz. “These funding cuts are going to have impacts that will be felt by everybody, by all the students,” Vasquez said. “Squeezing every dollar from programs that benefit the public good to pay for these tax cuts for the rich is the real reason this administration is doing this.” Source New Mexico is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

By JONATHAN MATTISE and JENNIFER McDERMOTT OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget. Working to 'amp up' domestic nuclear fuel production Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy. There's little of it made in the United States right now. Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation's first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors. A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to “amp up” domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department...."

(WPRI) — The Rhode Island Supreme Court has denied a former Providence school administrator's request to overturn his simple assault conviction for massaging a teenager's foot without permission in 2021. Olayinka Alege, 44, was found guilty in December 2023 of forcibly rubbing a 15-year-old boy's foot at The Edge Fitness Club in Warwick. BACKGROUND: Former Providence school administrator convicted of assault in 3rd trial The decision followed three separate trials. In 2022, Alege was first found guilty of the misdemeanor, but he later won his appeal and was granted a retrial. The second jury was unable to reach a verdict, resulting in a mistrial. A third trial ended in a guilty verdict after five days of testimony. Alege appealed again, arguing that the trial judge, Luis Matos, made several legal errors and violated his constitutional rights during sentencing. However, the Supreme Court rejected those claims on Monday, leaving his conviction, one-year probation sentence, and requirement to complete 140 hours of community service in place. Prosecutors said gym surveillance footage captured Alege approaching the teen and asking about his sneakers before removing one shoe and sock and rubbing his foot. The victim later told the court he found Alege's actions ""violating and offensive."" While Alege did admit to touching the victim's foot, he denied ""rubbing it for a prolonged period,"" according to the police report. Before working in Providence, Alege faced similar allegations in Florida, but was never criminally charged. In 2009, the Sun Sentinel reported that five minors accused Alege of popping or cracking their toes as punishment while he was an assistant principal at a Tampa school.

mov_C92FCC5135942DAFCA67DBADAC27D1C5,2025-07-16 17:18:51,en,WEB,"  If you've seen Annabelle, chances are you've spent at least one night terrified of a ruffled cover or discarded shirt at the foot of your bed. The 2014 film, which sees the eponymous evil doll causing havoc for all, was hatched from a supporting character in James Wan's The Conjuring (2013). Annabelle's debut was so terrifying that she arguably stole the spotlight from much more established ghosts in the franchise's first entry. The Conjuring, starring Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga as real-life paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren, dramatized an account of the Perron family haunting, which took place in Rhode Island in 1971. The films are based on truth but largely fictionalized, inspiring curiosity about Annabelle's real origins. Though her history is different from what's explained on screen, The Conjuring and Annabelle are somewhat similar to the doll's true story. (This is gradually less true as the sequels — 2017's Annabelle: Creation and 2019's Annabelle Comes Home — grow increasingly inane). Years after Annabelle made waves with her own feature film, Entertainment Weekly is taking a closer look at the true story behind the iconic doll. What is the plot of Annabelle? Annabelle follows John (Ward Horton) and Mia Form (Annabelle Wallis), a young couple in California expecting their first child. John brings home a porcelain doll for Mia, intending it as a gift for their baby. That very night, in a case of bizarrely complicated scripting, the Forms' neighbors — the Higgins — are slaughtered by a pair of Manson-lite cult members. When the Forms telephone the police, they inadvertently alert the cultists and have their own home invaded by the pair. The police arrive just in time and shoot down the scraggly-haired Charlie impersonator. Unfortunately, his young girlfriend slashes her throat in the Forms' nursery while clutching the brand-new doll. After news reports identify the female murderer as Annabelle Higgins, the daughter of the ill-fated neighbors, paranormal events begin to occur around the Forms' home — all of which seem to center around the doll. After the birth of their child, the family bins the toy and moves house, but when they later find it among their possessions, the supernatural occurrences return in more violent fashion. Mia does some digging and, with the help of a detective (Eric Ladin) and haunted bookseller Evelyn (Alfre Woodard), discovers that the cult intended to summon a demonic spirit, which latched onto the Forms when Annabelle killed herself in their home. Mia and John determine that the only way to rid themselves of the demon is to make a blood sacrifice, setting the stage for a viscera-splattered climax. Is Annabelle based on a true story? As with many of the characters and incidents in the Conjuring universe, Annabelle's plot is rooted in an element of basic truth before spinning off into increasingly fantastical realms. Like The Conjuring, Annabelle is based on one of the famous cases taken on by paranormal investigators Ed and Lorraine Warren. Annabelle Higgins was (allegedly) a real person, but the young girl died long before she had a chance to join a Satan-worshiping cult. There is indeed a real Annabelle doll, though she's a bit less creepy-looking than her cinematic counterpart. The New Haven Register once risked getting on Annabelle's bad side by describing her as “a plain-looking, classic Raggedy Ann doll with red yarn for hair.” Despite the cosmetic differences, the doll did have a purportedly evil history. It is said to have waged a campaign of terror against two young women before the Warrens came to their rescue. Where did the Annabelle doll come from? According to a presentation given by Lorraine Warren and her son-in-law Tony Spera on the night of Annabelle's theatrical release, and a case file from the New England Society of Psychic Research (NESPR), which the Warrens founded in 1952, a nurse named Donna received the doll in 1970 as a 28th birthday present from her mother. Legend has it the young nurse placed the doll beside her bed, only to notice it frequently changed positions. Sometimes its legs would be crossed; other times the doll would be splayed out on its side. Occasionally, it would turn up in a different room from where it was last seen. After this went on for a while, Donna and her roommate, Angie, began finding chilling messages scattered about their apartment. “Help me, help us,” the notes allegedly read. Weirder still, these were scrawled on ripped parchment paper, which the two women did not have in their apartment. At one point, a friend of theirs was reportedly napping on their couch. He woke up feeling as though he was being forcibly strangled and saw that the doll was staring directly at him. When he collected himself, he discovered he had scratch wounds on his body. The doll even seemed to be leaking blood at one point. The girls then reportedly contacted a medium to perform a seance, which determined that the Raggedy Ann doll was inhabited by the spirit of Annabelle Higgins, a young girl who resided on the property but died at age 7, long before the current apartment block was erected. Annabelle expressed feeling comfortable with the roommates and “wanted to stay with them and be loved,” according to the NESPR case file. Perhaps feeling sorry for the spirit, Donna and Angie gave Annabelle “permission to inhabit the doll” and, by extension, their home. How did Ed and Lorraine Warren come into possession of the Annabelle doll? After Father Cooke, a priest familiar with the case, tipped off the Warrens, they interceded on the roommate's behalf and examined Annabelle. They “came to the immediate conclusion that the doll itself was not in fact possessed but manipulated by an inhuman presence,” states NESPR's case file. “Truly, the spirit was not looking to stay attached to the doll, it was looking to possess a human host.” The Warrens took possession of the doll that day, and not a moment too soon. “The next stage of the infestation phenomenon would have been complete human possession,” the case file reads. “Had these experiences lasted another two or three more weeks, the spirit would have completely possessed, if not harmed or killed, one or all of the occupants in the house.” Before leaving with the doll, the Warrens reportedly had Father Cooke perform an exorcism on the apartment to rid the spirit of the building, though they still believed the entity resided within the doll...."

(AP) — Near signs that warn of radioactive risk at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, a half-dozen workers from the nuclear power company X-energy are making what appear to be gray billiard balls. Inside, they're packed with thousands of tiny black spheres that each contain a speck of uranium enriched beyond what today's power plants use. The United States is chasing a new age of nuclear power that banks on domestic production of reactor fuel like X-energy is making, and though the work at Oak Ridge is unfolding across just 3,000 square feet, X-energy and others are already revving up for big production. President Donald Trump set a goal of quadrupling domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years, signing executive orders in May to speed up development. A new wave of advanced nuclear reactors could be operational around 2030. But just like cars won't run without gas, those plants won't run without fuel. To expand nuclear energy long-term, the nation must maximize its nuclear fuel production, according to Trump. In Oak Ridge, X-energy has broken ground on a massive, nearly $2 billion campus for a new fuel fabrication facility, the first in the United States in over half a century. The nuclear fuel company Standard Nuclear, also in Oak Ridge, aims to produce metric tons of fuel for advanced reactors. A supplier named Orano is likewise looking to build a multibillion-dollar uranium enrichment facility nearby. “This is a unique time,” said Tyler Gerczak, Oak Ridge National Laboratory's principal investigator for the cooperative with X-energy's subsidiary TRISO-X. “The momentum is incredible.” Making the 'most robust nuclear fuel' The Associated Press toured the lab where X-energy is making small amounts of fuel for testing. Anyone beyond a magenta-and-yellow chain that warns of radioactivity must wear gowns, two layers of gloves and radiation monitors. When they leave, they're tested for radioactivity. X-energy, a Maryland-based company, uses uranium to make so-called TRISO fuel — inside what's known as “pebbles.” Those are the billiard balls. The Energy Department says it's the most robust nuclear fuel on Earth because the particles cannot melt in a reactor. At the lab, the first step is making a uranium cocktail that resembles dark yellow lemonade. Uranium powder, in the form of triuranium octoxide, gets added to nitric acid, said Dan Brown, vice president of fuel development for TRISO-X. Then carbon and an organic solution are added. They have two glass containers set up — one wears a heated jacket, looking almost like a little sweater, that helps the uranium dissolve into the acid solution. The second cools the acid solution while the carbon source is added, which turns the mix near-black, he said. At another station, in a long clear tube, the cocktail solidifies into small black spheres with a jellybean-like consistency. Those black balls, about the size of poppyseeds, then travel through machines under temperatures as high as 1,800 degrees Celsius to get protective carbon coatings — like candy dipping — that make them look like very tiny BBs. X-energy uses graphite and other cohesive materials to bind 18,000 kernels together into a larger sphere. That gets coated in a final layer of graphite to seal the final pebble. In the end, it's strong enough to withstand the weight of an SUV. The pebbles will eventually give up their energy in the high-temperature gas-cooled nuclear reactor X-energy is developing, with about 220,000 pebbles per reactor, like gumballs in a gumball machine. When they exit the bottom, if energy remains, the pebbles will return to the top for another pass. Each one could be used about six times. X-energy also plans to make fuel products for other advanced reactor designs. The national laboratory lends X-energy its expertise, research and high-tech equipment for analysis and will evaluate samples, as will some universities. Other samples are archived. Idaho National Laboratory received a batch for its advanced test reactor, Brown said. Show Caption1 of 9 Expand Critics of building more nuclear reactors say they're too expensive and riskier than other low-carbon energy sources. “Without a substantial decrease in construction costs, it's not worth the avoided greenhouse gas emissions,” said David Kemp, a Cato Institute policy analyst. Kemp said Trump's 25-year quadrupling goal is unrealistic because it would mean building nuclear reactors faster than ever. The United States lacks any next-generation reactors operating commercially and only two new large reactors have been built from scratch in nearly 50 years. Those two, at a Georgia nuclear plant, were completed years late and at least $17 billion over budget. Working to 'amp up' domestic nuclear fuel production Many next-generation reactors will use high-assay low-enriched uranium. It's fuel that's enriched to a higher level than traditional large nuclear reactors use, allowing the newer reactors to run longer and more efficiently, sit on smaller footprints and produce less waste, according to the Department of Energy. There's little of it made in the United States right now. Only Russia and China currently have the infrastructure to make large amounts of high-assay low-enriched uranium. In the United States, Centrus Energy produced the nation's first 20 kilograms of high-assay low-enriched uranium in more than 70 years in late 2023, to show it can produce limited quantities for commercial reactors. A big takeaway from Trump's executive orders is the need to “amp up” domestic production of nuclear fuel to reduce dependence on foreign sources and enable in the long term expansion of American nuclear energy, according to the Energy Department. At the Nuclear Energy Institute trade association, Benjamin Holtzman, director of new nuclear, said he thinks the fuel will be ready for a new generation of U.S. nuclear reactors needed to meet the growing demand for electricity — if the right actions are taken now...."

This comes after there have been rumors that Justin and Hailey's marriage was falling apart That's Justin's baby, she's iconic, and Hailey has a special message for the haters. The ""GO BABY"" singer posted a carousel of pictures on his Instagram on Wednesday, July 16 with the song ""SWEET SPOT"" featuring Sexyy Red attached. Justin posted several pictures of his wife, with Hailey posing with her middle finger up, holding her yellow Rhode case, as she wore a grey hoodie and leggings. Her other hand held a full cup of coffee. In both pictures, Hailey did not look at the camera as she posed outside. She instead made a funny face with her eyes rolled back and her tongue out. The other picture showed her eyes going a different direction and her tongue still out.

Justin then took a picture of Hailey standing outside again, looking at something, while holding up a full cup of coffee. Justin recently released his seventh studio album, SWAG, with many songs being inspired by Hailey. The album includes 20 tracks and features from Gunna, Sexyy Red, Lil B, Dijon, Cash Cobain, Eddie Benjamin and Druski. Not only was Justin belting songs about the love he has for his wife, but also subliminally addressed the rumors of their marriage going downhill. In the song, ""Waking Away,"" Justin sings about not leaving a person when things gets hard and references the promise he made in his vows. He sings, ""Baby, I ain't walking away / You are my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away."" The Biebers said ""I do"" in 2018 with a civil ceremony and later with a more formal wedding, surrounded by close friends and family, in South Carolina in 2019. They have since welcomed their first together, baby boy Jacky Blues, in August 2024. The two have tried to shut down breakup rumors with posts and interviews. Hailey even addressed the rumors in an interview with Vogue in May. She admitted to reading headlines about her and Justin and how hard she found it for people to understand who she is. Hailey said, ""And there's nothing you can do about that.

Lerman Epstein Becker & Green, P.C.Commercial Litigation Update - EBG In the wake of theDobbsdecision, which eliminated the constitutional right to abortion, individual states were left to regulate or ban the procedure. A patchwork of state laws subsequently followed, with some states enacting total bans and others permitting abortion access, with considerable variations in between. In addition to regulating or restricting access to the procedure, certain states have criminalized seeking, providing, and helping others obtain or provide abortion, especially those providing telehealth services, but these actions are legal and protected in New York. New York's 'Shield Law' consists of several statutes, enacted and intended to protect providers and patients offering or seeking abortion in New York against the imposition of criminal and civil liability originating from outside the state. According to the New York State Office of the Attorney General, '[t]he Shield Law broadly prohibits law enforcement and other state officials from cooperating with investigations into reproductive health care ('protected health care') so long as the care was lawfully provided in New York.' [1]Moreover, '[w]ith respect toreproductivehealth care specifically, these protections apply even if the care was provided via telehealth to a patient located out-of-state, so long as the provider was physically present in New York.' [2] New York's Shield Law creates substantive protections for reproductive health care, which can be summarized as follows: New York state and local law enforcement officers are prohibited from arresting (with or without a warrant) or extraditing anyone in connection with providing, facilitating, or receiving protected health care occurring in New York. [3]Unless the demanding state alleges in writing that the provider was physically present in that state at the time of the charged offense and fled from that state to New York, extradition requests must be denied and related warrants should not be executed. New York state and local law enforcement employees and entities are prohibited from cooperating with, providing information to, or using public resources in connection with investigations or proceedings relating to protected health care services lawfully provided in New York. [4]Protected information includes all state and local databases, such as from license-plate readers or health-related databases, in addition to information collected or held by state and local agencies or facilities. New York's Shield Law does not prohibit compliance with a valid out-of-state subpoena or warrant, so long as it is not related to an effort to penalize protected health care lawfully provided in New York, nor does it prohibit providing information to the subject of the investigation. Nevertheless, any information shared must not reveal personally identifying information related to individuals' medical procedures without the patient's consent, even under the law's narrow exemptions allowing for information sharing. Evidence related to protected health care services lawfully provided in New York that can be compelled by or admitted in state courts is limited by the Shield Act, impacting both civil and criminal proceedings, and covering subpoenas for deposition testimony, production of evidence, and/or inspection of premises. [5]When evidence related to reproductive health care is used to allege that the individual providing health care engaged in wrongdoing because the person receiving the care was not located in New York, such evidence is inadmissible in both civil and criminal proceedings. [6]Further, without a warrant, law enforcement agencies and officers are prohibited from purchasing or obtaining electronic data that would reveal information about an individual's personally identifiable health information. [7] New York's Shield Law was recently invoked to protect a New York physician, Dr. Margaret Carpenter, from Texas and Louisiana civil and criminal liability. In December 2024, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton filed a civil action against Dr. Carpenter alleging that she violated Texas law by prescribing and mailing abortion-inducing drugs to a Texas resident via telehealth without holding a medical license from Texas. [8]In February 2025, a Texas judge issued a default judgment against Dr. Carpenter for her failure to appear in court or respond to the complaint. She was ordered to pay a $100,000 civil penalty and permanently enjoined from prescribing abortion medication to Texas residents. [9]However, New York refused to enforce the Texas judgment punishing Dr. Carpenter, citing the state's Shield Law as protection from out-of-state legal actions related to abortion services. In January 2025, Dr. Carpenter was indicted by a grand jury in Louisiana on felony charges for allegedly prescribing abortion medication to a pregnant minor in Louisiana via telehealth. The charges against her included criminal abortion by means of abortion-inducing drugs. Louisiana issued an arrest warrant and requested extradition from New York. [10] Governor Kathy Hochul refused the extradition request invoking the state's Shield Law protection. [11] Other states have similar Shield Laws to New York, including California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington. As such, we could see these states protect their providers from civil and criminal litigation in the same manner as New York. These laws are increasingly being challenged by anti-abortion advocates, who argue that shield laws interfere with other states' legislative authority, shaking up the plight of interstate legal conflicts over reproductive rights.

The inclusion of unauthorized immigrants in the census data has implications for the apportionment of seats in the House, as it affects the distribution of political power. Currently, nineteen U.S. states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have laws in place that allow undocumented immigrants to obtain driver's licenses or driving permits. These states include: California Colorado Connecticut Delaware Hawaii Illinois Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota Nevada New Jersey New Mexico New York Oregon Rhode Island Utah Vermont Virginia Washington Note: The specific requirements and types of licenses issued can vary by state. Some states may issue ""driving-privilege only licenses"" that are not valid for federal identification purposes, while others offer licenses that can be used for both driving and state identification. The following municipalities allow noncitizen voting in some or all of their local elections: San Francisco, California: Noncitizens can vote in school board elections. Proposition N, passed in 2016, allowed noncitizen parents or guardians of children in the San Francisco Unified School District to vote in school board elections. Oakland, California: Approved in 2022, a charter amendment allows noncitizens who are parents or legal guardians to vote in school board elections. Takoma Park, Maryland: One of the first cities to restore noncitizen voting rights in 1992, noncitizens can vote in all local elections. Burlington, Vermont: In 2023, the city extended voting rights to noncitizens for local elections. Montpelier and Winooski, Vermont: Passed in 2021, these cities allow noncitizens to vote in local elections. The US Census Bureau includes all people residing in the United States, regardless of their legal status, in its population counts. This includes unauthorized immigrants, also known as ""illegal aliens"". The Census Bureau does not collect or publish data on the legal status of individuals, but it does provide estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population. Key points: Inclusion in the Census: The US Census is designed to count every person residing in the country, including those who are not US citizens or are unauthorized immigrants. Purpose of the Census: The primary purpose of the census is to apportion seats in the House of Representatives and the Electoral College, and this requires counting all residents. Estimates of Unauthorized Immigrants: While the Census Bureau doesn't track legal status, other agencies, like the Department of Homeland Security and the Migration Policy Institute, provide estimates of the unauthorized immigrant population. Legal Status is Not Collected: The Census Bureau does not ask about or track the legal status of individuals in its data collection. Apportionment: The inclusion of unauthorized immigrants in the census data has implications for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives, as it affects the distribution of political power."
mov_79851642B800A8326FFF54FF7D3100B6,2025-07-16 19:09:07,en,WEB,"  A group of 20 Democratic attorneys general filed a new lawsuit against the Trump administration Wednesday morning, aiming to restore a canceled grant program that helped states protect against potential disaster damage. The lawsuit says the administration in April illegally ended a multibillion-dollar Federal Emergency Management Agency program that was established under a 2018 law signed by President Donald Trump. The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts, also asks the court to declare that FEMA's current leader “is acting as FEMA administrator unlawfully.” David Richardson has been acting administrator since Trump appointed him in May, a position that avoids Senate confirmation and a statutory requirement that a FEMA administrator have experience in emergency management. Richardson is a former Marine officer and expert in weapons of mass destruction who has not worked in emergency management. After the administration canceled FEMA's Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, it reclaimed $4.5 billion in grants that had been approved for states but not spent. Without the BRIC money, states and communities have halted or scaled back dozens of projects aimed at protecting against flood damage, wildfires and other weather-related events. “The impact of the shutdown has been devastating,” the lawsuit says. The complaint says the administration lacks the authority to end the BRIC program and seeks a preliminary ruling that would restore the canceled funding. “President Trump and his lackeys have once again jeopardized public safety with their indiscriminate slashing of pre-disaster mitigation funding,” California Attorney General Rob Bonta (D) said in a statement. “We're taking them to court — not because we want to, but because we have to.” The Democratic attorneys general have filed other lawsuits challenging Trump's actions to cut off other FEMA funding and to require states to help with immigration enforcement in order to get FEMA funds. In addition to Bonta, the plaintiffs are the attorneys general of Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin.

mov_418DC41D607E1ACDF3E1F4651A5A6144,2025-07-16 19:46:01,en,WEB,"  PROVIDENCE — Newly-released police body-camera video from an immigration enforcement operation on Sunday sheds light on how Providence police officers interacted with ICE as the federal agents sought to detain an accused drug trafficker in the city, raising questions about whether police are adhering to an ordinance prohibiting them from assisting in immigration enforcement. The city's police chief, Colonel Oscar Perez, said in a news conference Monday that officers did not assist ICE, and were only on the scene of the Alverson Street incident because immigration agents crashed their truck into the suspect and another parked car. Police then stayed on scene to ensure public safety, Perez said. Excerpts from a body-camera video of Providence police on the scene of an ICE arrest on Alverson Street on Sunday. But in the video released Tuesday night, Providence officers appear to be helping ICE after taking the report of the car crash, including by asking a landlord if she can hand over her keys so ICE doesn't have to break down any doors in her home. A Providence police sergeant is also seen on the video looking at photos of the suspect with ICE, helping them determine if he saw the person through a window. “What is this, if it's not cooperation?” said City Council President Rachel Miller, who, along with other councilors, has asked for an external review. “Even the perception in the community that Providence police is working with ICE is damaging to overall community safety.” When the suspect comes out of the house later, Lieutenant William Brown tells an ICE agent: “I want your people grabbing him,” adding: “We'll help you.” The Providence External Review Authority, a civilian panel that oversees the police, plans to review the incident, executive director Ferenc Karoly said. He said he wants to review all of the videos, which have not yet been released. “The PPD supervisor telling ICE, 'we'll help you' isn't a great initial indicator that they did not help ICE with their operation,” Karoly said. A large swath of the 30-minute video is silent while officers are talking to ICE agents, and only one video has been released so far, from a camera worn by Sergeant Peter Salmons. Additional videos from other officers' are being reviewed and will be released, spokesperson Josh Estrella said. Steven Brown, the executive director of the ACLU of Rhode Island, noted city policy only allows officers to mute their cameras to “discuss issues surrounding an investigation with a supervisor or another officer in private.” “This is precisely the time that the public needs to hear what's being said, if in fact the police are not assisting ICE,” he said. Brown said police should not have stuck around after investigating the car crash. “By hanging around, Providence police became inextricably involved in the arrest,” Brown said. Perez told the Globe Wednesday he is reviewing whether Salmons violated the body-worn camera policy by muting his camera, but he said he has already determined that officers did not violate the policy that bars cooperation with ICE. “We understand how certain actions in the video may be interpreted, but it's important to clarify the role of our officers,” Perez said in a statement. “At no point did they assist in the enforcement efforts of federal laws.” ICE was seeking to detain Ivan Mendoza Meza, who spokesperson James Covington said is in the country illegally and was previously deported to Mexico back in 2019. Mendoza Meza is awaiting trial on felony drug charges in Providence from 2023, where he is accused of being a “key member” of a fentanyl trafficking organization that was being run out of a basement of a Plainfield Street restaurant. ICE says he's a member of the MS-13 gang in Honduras. City ordinance and Providence police policy prohibits officers from helping with civil immigration enforcement, regardless of the reason ICE wants to deport someone, unless there is a criminal warrant issued for a person in Providence police custody. No criminal warrant was issued in this case, Perez said, only an administrative detainer. In the video released Tuesday night, officers on scene initially are taking down the report of a car crash. Sergeant Salmons walks up to an ICE agent and asks, “what do you guys need from us?” The agent says the man they are looking for is in the basement of a home. He fled from a Toyota pickup truck after the collision with ICE. The video is then muted for 11 minutes, during which time officers are standing around and talking to ICE agents. Later, when audio resumes, officers tape off a section of the neighborhood and are telling neighbors, some of whom are swearing and calling them “pigs,” to stand behind the tape. Officers say in the video that ICE is waiting to get a warrant so they can go into the Alverson Street house where the suspect is hiding. Around 11:20 a.m., Salmons is seen knocking on the door of the house and speaking to the landlord to ask if anyone needs help evacuating. She says she and her children are trying to go to church. “My concern is separate from everybody else,” Salmons tells her. “I just want to make sure there's no people in this apartment building or this house that might get hurt if it turns violent.” He then asks her if she can hand over her keys, so that ICE does not have to break down any doors to get the suspect. She agrees. When he returns to where the ICE agents are standing in the backyard, Salmons relays that he saw a Hispanic man in a third floor window. ICE then shows him photos of Mendoza Meza, and they discuss whether he might be the person Salmons saw in the window. The ICE agents previously thought he was in the basement. Ultimately, ICE did not have to raid the home; Mendoza Meza came outside, and was met with both Providence officers and ICE agents on the stoop. He was put in handcuffs by ICE agents, and Providence officers walked next to the agents as he was led into the ICE vehicle. In an interview Wednesday, Perez denied that the Providence police actions constituted cooperation. “The goal was never to assist,” Perez said. “It was to minimize harm, avoid escalations and protect bystanders and neighbors.” He noted that in other cities, including Worcester, Mass., immigration enforcement has turned chaotic, with protesters trying to stop ICE, and ultimately getting arrested. Perez said if Mendoza Meza had not come out voluntarily, ICE was preparing to call a SWAT tactical team to go get him inside the house...."

Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in all eight “Harry Potter” films, lost her driving privileges for six months Wednesday in Britain after racking up more than a dozen points on her driving record in the space of two years. She was also ordered to pay more than $1,400 (1,044 pounds), according to multiple media reports Wednesday. Watson didn't attend the hearing at High Wycombe Magistrates' Court, about 30 miles northwest of London. She had previously pleaded guilty to the offense via mail. The “Beauty and the Beast” actor, 35, already had 9 points on her record, the BBC reported, tied to offenses in October 2023, November 2023 and January 2024. The most recent citation came on July 31, 2024, for driving her Audi A3 38 mph in a 30 mph zone, according to the Mirror. That's the same car that reportedly got towed in February 2024 after Watson didn't see a “no parking” sign, blocked a driveway, went to meet her mom at a pub across the street and trapped a couple of cars in a gated compound for more than three hours. Also, in a strange coincidence, actor Zoe Wanamaker, who appeared as flying-broom instructor Madame Hooch in 2001's “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,” got the same treatment for almost the same offense shortly after Watson's license was pulled, the Sun reported Wednesday. The actor, who works primarily in television, most recently got popped for going 46 mph in a 40 mph zone. She too hit 12 points on her record with her fourth speeding citation. Wanamaker was fined $885 (660 pounds) and hit with $488 (364 pounds) in court costs, per the Sun. Watson's total payment included court costs as well. Speeding offenses in Britain carry 3 to 6 points each, depending on the circumstance, and stay on a driver's record for four years. Driving under the influence — called “drink driving” or “drug driving” in the U.K. — carries up to 11 points, as do violations including vehicular manslaughter, racing on the highway and “dangerous” or “furious” driving. Serious violations stay on a driver's record for up to 11 years. Watson, who last appeared on the big screen as Meg in 2019's “Little Women,” followed by a role in the promotonal short film “Paradoxe” for a Prada campaign in 2022, is studying for the equivalent of a Ph.D. in creative writing at Oxford University. She graduated from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, with a bachelor's degree in 2014. Also on the “Harry Potter” front, as the wizarding tale prepares for its TV series reboot, HBO on Tuesday released a first-look photo of “How to Train Your Dragon” actor Nick Frost done up as Hagrid.

The mom of five, two sons and three daughters, also joked, “They call Olivia an influencer but we don't know because we're not influenced by it.” Her comment added a wholesome, cute, and innocent touch to the age-old story of a mother trying to make sense of her daughter's antics. But while Susan cannot comprehend the influencer life, she has three decades of experience in one thing Olivia has only hours of: Being a mother.49ers RB Christian McCaffrey and Olivia Culpo welcomed a baby girl into the world yesterday. And we already know they're going to shower that lil one with love. With four uncles and aunts, loving grandparents, a 3-time Pro-Bowler football star for a dad, and a former Miss Universe for a mom, it sounds like something straight out of an Italian sitcom. During Olivia's pregnancy, she was grateful for the support she got. Especially from her mother. In a recent interview with the People, Culpo said, “It's just an ironic thought that you need your mom the most when you're about to become a mom.” She added, “That's just genuinely how I felt. “ And her mother, now a grandmother, is still standing by her side. In a recent story posted to Olivia's Instagram, the newborn baby made Susan melt. The head shake, the silly mouth movements, and the unmistakable smile on the face. Susan couldn't hold back her excitement when holding the baby. A text at the bottom read “ Christian said Your mom said she's not leaving until you can walk down the stairs. So just don't walk down the stairs right??????” Christian hinted at the game plan, and Olivio decided to play it out. Looking carefully, another text appeared at the bottom where Olivia added, “ Honestly not the worst plan! I will be limping until further notice.” When mom's there, we don't lift a finger, right? While the family welcomes a new member, Susan has not forgotten her duties as a mother and now as a grandmother. Given how her daughter's pregnancy term was. Olivia Culpo and Christian McCaffrey welcome their first baby June 29th, 2024, saw Olivia making her bridal walk in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. She tied the knot with the 2023 Offensive Player of the Year, Christian McCaffrey, in a dreamy wedding. Their relationship began quietly in 2019 and was made public in 2020 when the couple appeared together for the NFL Honors. Engaged in 2023, married in 2024, and now in 2025, they've welcomed a baby girl into the world. Expand Post Calling it the “Scariest and most rewarding of all experiences,” Olivia took to Instagram to announce the arrival of their firstborn. In a carousel of pictures shared, one with the baby's hand visible, another where Christian, Olivia, and the baby are seen together, the couple, now Mom and Dad, welcomed “Colette Annalise McCaffrey” into the family. “As soon as he came into the room I felt most at peace. Look at the grip,” continued Olivia. Olivia had a difficult time with her pregnancy because of her lifelong battle with endometriosis. One of the biggest complications with endometriosis is infertility. Before she got pregnant, she harbored concerns about not being able to have children. In a 2022 episode of The Culpo Sisters, she said, “I want to have kids, but I want to make sure that I can,” she said. “It could be really hard for me to have babies.” Thankfully, it all worked out in the end, and we all await her journey in the next chapter: Motherhood."

However, not long after this beverage rolled on the scene did it start making news. In the wake of the drink's debut, at least four lawsuits were brought forward against Panera, two of them involving the deaths of people who consumed the Charged Lemonade. As of 2024, the drink was removed from the Panera menu, and earlier this month, the company settled the remaining lawsuits. Here, everything that went down with the Panera Charged Lemonade lawsuits. Justin Sullivan/ The story begins in 2022 Tragically, in September of 2022, 21-year-old college student Sarah Katz went into cardiac arrest while at a restaurant with friends before she died after suffering another cardiac arrest. Katz was diagnosed with a heart condition, long QT syndrome, at 5 years old, which causes irregular and rapid heartbeats. In the wrongful death suit her parents brought forth against the restaurant chain, they claimed she had consumed the Charged Lemonade believing it to be their standard lemonade, as their daughter actively avoided energy drinks for the sake of her condition. In October of 2024, Panera settled the lawsuit. According to their website, a regular size Charged Lemonade contains 260 milligrams of caffeine, while the large was said to have contained 390 milligrams. A second death occurred not long after Soon after Katz' death, another man died after consuming the Charged lemonade. Dennis Brown, 46, was said to have ordered a Charged Lemonade and was believed to have had two refills over the span of an hour and a half. On his walk home, he tragically passed away. Brown, who had a chromosomal deficiency disorder, high blood pressure and ADHD, was also said to avoid energy drinks. Smith Collection/Gado/ Two other individuals suffered after consuming Charged Lemonade Though only two wrongful death claims have been brought forth in relation to Charged Lemonade consumption, two other consumers claim to now suffer from cardiac issues. One 28-year-old from Rhode Island claimed to have developed permanent heart issues after drinking this beverage despite not having any prior health issues. Additionally, a Pennsylvania teen allegedly had to be resuscitated after consuming this drink. Panera settles the remaining Charged Lemonade lawsuits The caffeinated drink was removed from the menu in May of 2024, and earlier this week, the three cases involving Mr. Brown, the Rhode Island resident and the Pennsylvania teen were dismissed with prejudice, which means they cannot be filed again."

You know we are headed for trouble when people start buying groceries on the installment plan. That is the business model behind the popular ""buy now, pay later"" borrowing platforms -- loans that spread out purchases into four payments. Troubles are growing in several credit sectors -- in car loans, credit card debt and student loans. Inflation, driven by monstrous federal deficits plus a trade war, has already led to higher borrowing costs, which makes paying borrowed money back all that harder. The nation's top cartoonists take on the Republicans' big bill. ""Buy now, pay later"" seems to be catnip for younger consumers who are digitally savvy and do a lot of buying online. Its shoppers spent about $19.2 billion in the first quarter of this year. Modest wages play a part, but so does the allure of online shopping, which makes the purchase of fancy steak knives or luxury handbags feel so seamless. Over half of ""buy now, pay later"" users responding to a Harris poll admitted that splitting payments let them spend more than they knew they should. Almost a quarter said their spending on these digital platforms was ""out of control"" and that they couldn't afford most of what they bought without splitting payments. Every summer has a song. It's often something to argue over when conversation lags at the barbecue. ""Buy now, pay later"" lets people dig deeper into the debt hole, which ""will be harder and harder to climb out of,"" Ed deHaan, an accounting professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, told Bloomberg News. That happens more ""easily when there's no transparency."" And there hasn't been transparency. This huge form of borrowing hadn't shown up in Americans' credit scores. The ""buy now, pay later"" giants say they don't want to release that information because it could hurt credit scores needed to secure mortgages and other important loans. Why didn't these borrowers use credit cards instead? The answer, in part, is that a third of them had already nearly maxed out on credit cards. ""Buy now, pay later"" traditionally attracts struggling low-wage earners and now more middle-class customers. FICO (Fair Isaac Corp.) is the company behind the most-used credit scores. It plans to roll out a new model that factors these ""buy now, pay later"" loans into their calculations. Apple is the first big ""buy now, pay later"" provider to give transaction and payment data to Experian, one of the big-three credit reporting agencies. But things are getting tough all over in the consumer debt world. Credit card delinquency rates have recently reached the highest level since at least 2012. The number of auto loans that were at least 90 days late in the first quarter was up over 13% from the same period a year ago, according to the New York Fed. The thing is, many Americans can't get to work without their cars and trucks. ""When auto loan delinquencies are rising, it's a likely sign that people are struggling,"" LendingTree consumer finance analyst Matt Schulz told Fox News. ""That's no great surprise, given stubborn inflation, high interest rates and general economic uncertainty."" Schulz adds that these numbers are especially worrisome because unemployment rates are still relatively low. What about student debt? Nearly 25% of the $1.6 trillion in the federal student loan portfolio is at risk of default, according to Investopedia. TransUnion, another big credit-rating agency, reports that a record-high 31% of federal student loan borrowers are already 90 or more days past due. It's hard to see the current leadership in Washington doing anything other than make the problem worse. Higher federal borrowing at higher interest is on track to make life in this country more expensive. (Moody's recently stripped the U.S. of its last triple-A credit rating.) The Trump administration, meanwhile, is busy dismantling the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau put a lid on some predatory lending practices. The canary is singing ""A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall."" The U.S. economy is looking shakier. No amount of bullying the Federal Reserve can change that.

FULL TEXT Link to Image FALL RIVER - City officials on Wednesday pledged to increase staffing at the fire department in the wake of a deadly fire at an assisted living facility on Sunday that killed nine people and injured dozens, a blaze that the city's fire chief said was ""accidental."" The move comes after the city has faced criticism by the firefighters union that the department has been understaffed for years. ""In constant communication with our chief and members of the union, we've been going back and forth over how we can increase the count on some of our trucks, and today we came to the realization that we can go up by four,"" Mayor Paul Coogan told reporters at a press conference Wednesday. ""So instead of having two trucks at the minimum standard by the fire safety commission, we're going to go to six."" Officials said the department has 10 trucks in total and six will now have at least four firefighters, an increase from just two trucks having four firefighters. Earlier, Fall River Fire Chief Jeffrey Bacon fought back tears as he told reporters about the emotional impact firefighters and other emergency responders have faced in its wake. Link to Image ""There's no doubt in my mind that fire was destined to kill 50-plus people,"" said Chief Bacon. ""Unfortunately, nine lives were not able to be saved. But that number should have been four to five times that."" Authorities have not identified the cause of the fire, the deadliest in Massachusetts in more than four decades, but have said it was not suspicious. ""There's nothing intentional about this fire,"" he said. The Bristol District Attorney's office on Wednesday identified an eighth victim as Joseph Wilansky, 77. The name of the ninth victim, a 70-year-old woman, has not been released pending notification of her family. A 66-year-old woman remains hospitalized in critical condition, the district attorney's office said. Bacon said two patients remain in critical condition at Rhode Island Hospital. Bacon said a temporary shelter for the displaced residents has closed and thanked the workers, and others in the community, who have provided food, clothing, and other items. ""It's been a really incredible outpouring and show of support for the residents, the victims, the families, the fire department, and all of public safety in the city of Fall River, and we're very appreciative of that,"" he said. Bacon said that he considered having some of his firefighters join him at the press conference, but he said they need more time. ""The emotions are a little too raw, the stories are a little too vivid,"" he said. ""It's more incredible than what I initially thought it was going to be."" He said crews made live-saving efforts that were ""nothing short of heroic."" Bacon described the scene that the first firefighters confronted when they reached the Gabriel House about 9:30 p.m. on Sunday. He said Engine 5 was first to arrive and the captain, whom Bacon called ""an incredible firefighter and a great leader,"" got off the truck and found the area ""eerily quiet."" Flames were ""blowing out the front door"" and the three-man crew advanced with two hoses, although usually it takes at least two firefighters to operate a single hose, Bacon said. ""But he recognized the danger in that building and the risks that were posed [to] the residents, and he ordered his crew to advance two hose lines with three of them,"" Bacon said. ""He knocked down the fire very quickly, to the point that countless lives were saved."" As more trucks pulled up to the ""chaotic scene,"" firefighters described seeing some people inside, Bacon said. ""They described seeing faces in windows and having to decide who they need to rescue,"" Bacon said, his voice cracking with emotion. Earlier in the day, Coogan said he has contacted families of seven of the nine residents who died in the fire. ""They were all extremely sad,"" he said in a phone interview, adding that they also complimented the city's response to the fire. ""A couple of them were extremely upset. I can only imagine the shock they're going through."" Coogan, who was quoted by some media outlets as saying that only two employees were working at the time of the fire, said Wednesday he has no independent knowledge of the staffing inside the home. ""I must have driven past it 100 times, but I don't know what goes on inside,"" he said. Coogan said that the 24 hours after the fire was discovered were among the most difficult in his life. ""I'm 72 years old now and that was the toughest day of my life from a work perspective. And I've worked my whole life,"" he said. ""It was organized chaos at that site."" Dennis Etzkorn, the owner of Gabriel House, was seen clearing out the facility on Tuesday, removing computer monitors and boxes. He returned to the facility on Wednesday but declined to speak with reporters. Coogan said Wednesday that Etzkorn has been in contact with investigators and city officials and has promised to provide documents and reports as requested. ""I believe he's going to have to give us, or investigators, all of his documentation of what he's done in that building, for renovations, inspections, whatever you use, quarterly reports,"" Coogan said. ""I think he's got to make sure he was doing all he needed to do to keep his residents safe and in a nice secure setting."" Coogan said Etzkorn will have to repay the city for money spent on transporting, sheltering, and feeding residents since the fire. Coogan said he believes Etzkorn has a responsibility to speak with the relatives of those who lost their lives, help displaced residents find shelter, and provide assistance to his employees, who may be out of work...."

mov_0F0E7DC9121A0C4665B0BB9DE0584C01,2025-07-16 22:24:53,en,WEB,"  Teamsters Achieve Legislative Successes in Worker Protection The Rhode Island Teamsters have successfully secured essential legislative victories, marking a significant step forward for labor rights and safety measures in the state. Recently, Governor Daniel McKee endorsed two pivotal laws aimed at enhancing the protection of workers and improving safety protocols, especially for school bus operations. New Laws Established to Foster Worker Rights Among the most significant changes is the legislation, H5506A/S126A, which prohibits mandatory attendance at what are known as captive audience meetings. These meetings are typically employer-led gatherings where anti-union sentiments are often propagated to discourage workers from organizing. By eliminating this requirement, the law bolsters workers' rights and promotes a more democratic workplace. The second piece of legislation, H5421A/S568A, mandates that all school buses must now be outfitted with video systems facing outward. This vital safety measure is designed not only to safeguard students but also to protect the workforce involved in transporting them. These enhancements aim to create a safer environment aboard school buses, addressing safety concerns that have long been a priority for both the union and the community. Impact and Significance of the New Legislation Matt Taibi, Secretary-Treasurer of Teamsters Local 251, expressed his enthusiasm for these victories, stating, ""These are huge victories for Rhode Island Teamsters and working families across the state. Because of our efforts, workplace democracy is emboldened, and more people's lives are going to be saved."" His sentiments highlight just how crucial these laws are for the protection and empowerment of labor forces across the region. Advocacy Leading to Broader Changes Thanks to the advocacy of the Teamsters, Rhode Island now joins 12 other states in banning or limiting these captive audience meetings, including Alaska, California, and New Jersey. The expansion of such protective measures across multiple states underscores a growing recognition of workers' rights. Continued Efforts Towards Worker Advocacy These recent laws represent just the latest in a series of legislative achievements pushed by Teamsters Local 251. In previous years, the union has successfully championed measures that enhance school bus workers' rights, such as implementing prevailing wage standards, guaranteeing 180 paid school days, and providing protections against arbitrary dismissals by school districts. Furthermore, the union ensured that workers' rights were considered during the formation of a commission aimed at improving public school transportation. Looking Forward Despite these hard-won victories, Taibi emphasized that the work is far from over. ""Today we celebrate, but let's be clear: we're not done. We still have many other legislative priorities, and our fight continues until every one of them is law,"" he stated, reflecting the ongoing commitment of the Teamsters to advocate for further improvements in labor rights. Community Representation and Support Teamsters Local 251 represents more than 6,300 workers across various industries, playing a crucial role in ensuring that their voices are heard and their rights protected. Their ongoing efforts in advocacy not only enhance labor standards but also work toward better working conditions for all members. For more information about their initiatives, Teamsters Local 251 encourages individuals to visit their official website. Frequently Asked Questions What recent laws have been enacted by the Teamsters in Rhode Island? Recent laws include a ban on mandatory attendance at captive audience meetings and a requirement for all school buses to have outward-facing video systems for safety. Why are the new laws considered significant for workers? These laws enhance worker rights and safety, empowering employees to organize without fear of employer retaliation and ensuring safer transportation for students. How many states have similar laws regarding captive audience meetings? There are now 13 states, including Rhode Island, that have enacted laws to ban or restrict captive audience meetings, promoting workers' rights nationwide. What other protections for school bus workers have been achieved? Protections include prevailing wage standards, guaranteed paid school days, and safeguards against arbitrary removal by school districts, reflecting the union's commitment to worker rights. What are the Teamsters' future goals? Teamsters Local 251 aims to continue their legislative efforts, focusing on additional worker protections and rights until all their priorities are enacted into law.

mov_77933F6B30519BBDD9C779EFBCAC6576,2025-07-16 22:26:51,en,WEB,"  Many organizations have been working diligently to comply with the 13 state consumer privacy laws (CPLs) in effect in the first half of 2025 (14 if you count Florida). Some have chosen to comply on a state-by-state basis and others have followed the high-watermark approach of applying the strictest standard from among the CPLs to all states with CPLs or on a nationwide basis. Regardless of the chosen approach, the next six months brings a new batch of CPLs, some with material differences from the earlier generations, starting as early as July 1, 2025. In addition, amendments to CPLs already in effect will bring new obligations and requirements for many businesses during the second half of 2025. Accordingly, if these changes were not prospectively addressed, now is the time to confirm which of new CPLs are applicable, and timely revise privacy notices and compliance program procedures. Also, with the increase in CPL enforcement, and the growing size and frequency of civil penalties, now is also a good time for an overall privacy compliance checkup. (A list of the 20 CPLs and their effective dates and applicability thresholds is included in an appendix at the end.) The New CPLs During the second half of 2025, three CPLs come into effect (Q3-Q4 CPLs) and another three are effective as of January 1, 2026 (2026 CLPs): If a business has not already built the new CPLs into prior updates to its privacy notice and compliance program, then, assuming the applicability thresholds are met and no exemptions apply, addressing the Q3-Q4 CPLs and 2026 CPLs, as well as CPL amendments effective between now and January 1, 2026, can help create efficiencies by mitigating the need to make multiple rolling updates. This also can reset the California notice 12-month lookback, thereby helping avoid a year-end rush to address the lookback and the 2026 CLPs. A business may, however, wish to reserve the right to honor new or changed consumer privacy rights only as and when the rights are in effect. The Amended CPLs Three of the CPLs already in effect have significant amendments effective during the second half of 2025: Colorado, Montana and Oregon. Six more amendments are effective during 2026: Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Oregon, Utah and Virginia. Also New An amendment to the Texas Data Broker Law, effective September 1, 2025, expands the definition of, and thresholds of coverage for, data brokers and also increases transparency obligations. In addition, two states enacted new minor-focused privacy laws, and two states enacted age-appropriate design laws, joining the enjoined California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act and the Maryland Age-Appropriate Design Code Act. Key Compliance Considerations Consumer Privacy Rights and Privacy Notice Requirements While the new CPLs include consumer privacy rights similar to current CPLs, they also include noteworthy deviations. One key area of deviation relates to the information rights of consumers about third-party recipients of personal data sales and certain other disclosures. The Minnesota CPL requires that a controller provide a consumer with the right to obtain a list of specific“third parties” to which the controller has disclosed personal data. (Note that processors and their affiliates are not third parties). If the controller does not maintain the list in a format specific to the consumer making the request, then the controller may provide a list of specific third parties to whom the controller has disclosed any consumers' personal data. This is a significant burden but should be a familiar obligation to controllers subject to the Oregon CPL. We recommend that controllers subject to the Minnesota CPL and the Oregon CPL view this requirement as applicable to disclosures to “third parties,” which includes “sales” resulting from third-party cookies. Like the majority of the CPLs, the Minnesota CPL and Oregon CPL define “sale” as an exchange of personal data for any valuable consideration. (Only Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee, Utah, and Virginia define “sale” as an exchange for monetary consideration only.) Also, this disclosure obligation is retrospective, not a snapshot in time, but is subject to exemptions. The Maryland CPL – like the Delaware CPL – requires a list of categories of third-party recipients as to the specific consumer or, if the controller does not maintain the recipient categories list in a format specific to the consumer, a list of the categories of recipients of all consumers' personal data will suffice. Requiring categories of recipients, rather than specific recipients, is much less burdensome. An amendment to the Montana CPL (effective October 1, 2025) requires that a controller's privacy notice include an “explanation” of consumer rights, in addition to the currently-effective requirement for a description of how consumers may exercise their consumer rights. This explanation requirement is consistent with other CPL requirements; i.e., privacy notices must clearly explain the privacy rights available to consumers and how consumers can exercise them. We have seen enforcement inquiries by state regulators taking issue with unclear explanations of which privacy rights apply to residents of which state. However, the most significant new privacy notice requirements are in the Rhode Island CPL. Effective January 1, 2026, the Rhode Island CPL's first operative section applies to a “website or internet service online service provider” that is subject to Rhode Island jurisdiction (Online Service). This definition of Online Service provider is both broader (because no thresholds apply) and narrower (because it applies online only) than “controller.” An Online Service provider must, however, designate a controller if the provider collects, stores and sells “personally identifiable information” of “customers” (which is defined similarly to “consumers” in the other CPLs). The term “personally identifiable information” is not defined, (§ 6-48.1-4(a)), and whether this term is intended as narrower than “personal data,” which is used in all other sections of the Rhode Island CPL is unclear. Like the majority of the CPLs, the Rhode Island CPL defines “sale” as an exchange of personal data for any valuable consideration. But, unlike the other CPLs, an Online Service provider must include in its privacy notice details about “all third parties” to which the controller “has sold or may sell” [emphasis added] its customers' personally identifiable information. For some Online Service providers, the inclusion of “may sell” will require ongoing privacy notice updates, such as for sales to new third parties. As with the Oregon and Minnesota CPLs, complying retrospectively with the disclosure obligations is a challenge, especially as to cookies, which can frequently change. A “controller” also must clearly and conspicuously disclose sales of personal data for targeted advertising (§ 6-48.1-3(b)). No specific posting requirements apply in the subsection that requires this targeted advertising disclosure but, presumably, the “conspicuous location on its website or online service platform where similar notices are customarily posted” from the prior subsection (§ 6-48.1-4(a)) applies. Also noteworthy: effective July 1, 2026, an amendment to the Connecticut CPL adds new disclosure requirements in § 42-520, such as a statement in the privacy notice disclosing “whether the controller collects, uses or sells personal data for the purpose of training large language models” (among other new requirements).

(Photo by Erica Denhoff/Icon Sportswire via ) The International Tennis Hall of Fame has rejected a $10 million gift from hedge fund billionaire Bill Ackman after his widely criticized entry in its ATP Challenger event, according to Front Office Sports. The 59-year-old Ackman, a longtime tennis fan, competed in the Hall of Fame Open in Rhode Island last week as a doubles team with former top 10 player Jack Sock, losing to Omar Jasika and Bernard Tomic 6-1, 7-5. The Challenger Tour is the tier below the ATP Tour, but still an actual professional tournament. Ackman received a wild-card entry after a history of philanthropy with the Hall of Fame and played like, well, a 59-year-old tennis enthusiast with no professional experience thrown into a group of professionals. Jasika and Tomic were openly going easy on him, and it didn't prevent him and Sock from losing in straight sets. The decision to add a billionaire to the tournament it hosts led to a wave of criticism toward the Hall of Fame in the tennis community, most notably from former world No. 1 Andy Roddick, the last American man to win a Grand Slam singles title. Speaking on his ""Quick Served"" podcast, Roddick called the match ""a total miss,"" ""pathetic,"" ""hard to watch,"" and ""the biggest joke I've watched in professional tennis."" He actually said he didn't blame Ackman for his decision to play, placing the onus on the Hall, and praised the billionaire's effort, but said he believed the decisions behind the match would warrant a review. More: ""This was beneath the Hall of Fame, in my opinion."" You can judge the respective effort levels in the video of the match below: Three days after the match, Ackman posted a lengthy tweet in which he defended the Hall of Fame, criticized his own play and pledged to set up a $10 million endowment he would manage, giving the Hall 10% of the principal each year. He also called the match an overall success, describing it as ""one of the greatest public relations achievements in tennis history"" for the Hall, partially due to his failure on the court, and challenged Roddick to a doubles match. He said the criticism the Hall received was ""entirely"" on him, but also tried to explain why he played so badly. ""What has not been disclosed is that I played a doubles tournament 10 days prior at the HOF, and I played great. The field was comprised of former pros and top college players from around the world, but 55 plus in age. Richey Reneberg and I lost in the semis to the ultimate winners of the tournament in the tie breaker ... Where things went wrong is that I hadn't been beta tested in a professional tournament and my nerves got to me. ""Jack also chose the ad side and I have been playing the ad side for the last year. I was also serving into the 1:30pm sun with a shot clock (a new experience for me), and to make matters worse the other side held back making the whole thing look like a farce."" Everyone has a different definition of success, but it appears the Hall has been less happy than Ackman about how this has played out. While it declined comment to FOS, it reportedly said in a letter to its members and board that it would reject the donation to avoid ""any perception of impropriety,"" then added: “In hindsight, we would not make this decision again,” it added, referring to Ackman's wildcard entry."

Emma Watson, who played Hermione Granger in all eight “Harry Potter” films, lost her driving privileges for six months Wednesday in Britain after racking up more than a dozen points on her driving record in the space of two years. She was also ordered to pay more than $1,400 (1,044 pounds), according to multiple media reports Wednesday. Watson didn't attend the hearing at High Wycombe Magistrates' Court, about 30 miles northwest of London. She had previously pleaded guilty to the offense via mail. The “Beauty and the Beast” actor, 35, already had 9 points on her record, the BBC reported, tied to offenses in October 2023, November 2023 and January 2024. The most recent citation came on July 31, 2024, for driving her Audi A3 38 mph in a 30 mph zone, according to the Mirror. That's the same car that reportedly got towed in February 2024 after Watson didn't see a “no parking” sign, blocked a driveway, went to meet her mom at a pub across the street and trapped a couple of cars in a gated compound for more than three hours. Also, in a strange coincidence, actor Zoe Wanamaker, who appeared as flying-broom instructor Madame Hooch in 2001's “Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,” got the same treatment for almost the same offense shortly after Watson's license was pulled, the Sun reported Wednesday. The actor, who works primarily in television, most recently got popped for going 46 mph in a 40 mph zone. She too hit 12 points on her record with her fourth speeding citation. Wanamaker was fined $885 (660 pounds) and hit with $488 (364 pounds) in court costs, per the Sun. Watson's total payment included court costs as well. Speeding offenses in Britain carry 3 to 6 points each, depending on the circumstance, and stay on a driver's record for four years. Driving under the influence — called “drink driving” or “drug driving” in the U.K. — carries up to 11 points, as do violations including vehicular manslaughter, racing on the highway and “dangerous” or “furious” driving. Serious violations stay on a driver's record for up to 11 years. Watson, who last appeared on the big screen as Meg in 2019's “Little Women,” followed by a role in the promotonal short film “Paradoxe” for a Prada campaign in 2022, is studying for the equivalent of a Ph.D. in creative writing at Oxford University. She graduated from Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, with a bachelor's degree in 2014. Also on the “Harry Potter” front, as the wizarding tale prepares for its TV series reboot, HBO on Tuesday released a first-look photo of “How to Train Your Dragon” actor Nick Frost done up as Hagrid. Robbie Coltrane, who played half-giant gamekeeper Rubeus Hagrid in the movies, died in October 2022 of multiple organ failure after two years of illness. John Lithgow will play Dumbledore in the streaming series while newcomers Arabella Stanton, Dominic McLaughlin and Alastair Stout will play Hermione, Harry and Ron, respectively."

La jugadora recibió una invitación especial para competir por última vez ante su público. La noticia fue oficializada por la Federación Canadiense de Tenis y luego ratificada por la propia jugadora en sus redes sociales. “Sabés cuándo es el momento. Para mí, es ahora”, escribió Bouchard, de 31 años, en un mensaje acompañado por imágenes de distintas etapas de su carrera, desde pequeña a grande. “Terminando donde todo comenzó: Montreal”, concluyó la tenista nacida en esa ciudad. Bouchard alcanzó el punto más alto de su trayectoria en 2014, cuando se convirtió en la primera canadiense en disputar una final de Grand Slam. Fue en Wimbledon, donde cayó ante la checa Petra Kvitova. Ese mismo año había alcanzado las semifinales del Abierto de Australia y Roland Garros; además logró ubicarse en el quinto puesto del ranking mundial, su mejor posición histórica. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Ganadora de un título en el circuito WTA (Nuremberg 2014), su carrera dio un vuelco inesperado en 2015, tras sufrir una conmoción cerebral al resbalar en los vestuarios del US Open. El incidente derivó en una demanda judicial que terminó con un fallo parcial a su favor, pero a partir de entonces sus apariciones en los torneos de primer nivel se volvieron esporádicas. En los últimos años, Bouchard compitió mayormente en certámenes menores y también incursionó en el circuito profesional de pickleball, una disciplina en auge en América del Norte. En lo que va de 2025, apenas ha disputado un partido de la gira de la WTA esta temporada, y su ranking ha quedado muy lejos del top 100. Su récord como profesional en individuales es de 299 victorias y 230 derrotas, con ganancias oficiales por 6,9 millones de dólares. A pesar de que no compitió mucho en los últimos años, su anuncio del retiro no deja de ser sorpresivo Su último partido lo disputó la semana pasada, en el torneo W125 de Newport, en Rhode Island, donde perdió en primera ruda con la norteamericana Anna Rogers, luego de recibir un wild card. Fue su primer cotejo oficial en casi un año; en 2024 apenas disputó dos torneos. Más allá de sus altibajos, Bouchard se convirtió en un ícono del deporte canadiense. Fue parte del equipo nacional que en 2023 conquistó por primera vez la Billie Jean King Cup, y durante varios años fue la cara visible de un proceso de crecimiento del tenis femenino en su país. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad “Ha sido una de las figuras más importantes en la historia de nuestro deporte y una pionera que redefinió lo que el tenis canadiense podía ser”, destacó Valérie Tétreault, directora del torneo de Montreal. Su última aparición será en el estadio IGA, sede del certamen canadiense, que se alterna anualmente entre Toronto y Montreal, y este año corresponde a la rama femenina jugar en la ciudad natal de Bouchard. La organización le concedió una invitación especial, y se espera que su despedida convoque a una gran cantidad de público local. El retiro de Bouchard marca el final de una etapa. Su irrupción precoz, su impacto mediático y su estilo de juego ofensivo la convirtieron en una de las figuras más reconocibles del tenis internacional en la última década. Aunque sus logros deportivos no fueron sostenidos en el tiempo, deja una huella imborrable tanto dentro como fuera de la cancha. Con información de AP"
tw_sl_072ceb04948041007b81c26b74ef2529,2025-07-16 23:23:20,en,WEB,"  By Jim Thomas | Wednesday, 16 July 2025 06:31 PM EDT The National Shooting Sports Foundation has disputed a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics, arguing that Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data contradicts claims that states with permissive gun laws lead in adolescent firearm deaths, Breitbart reported. A June 2025 study published in the JAMA Pediatrics claimed that states with lenient gun laws were responsible for significantly more pediatric firearm deaths than states with stricter regulations. However, the NSSF, disputed the findings, saying raw data from the CDC tell a different story. The study, titled ""Firearm Laws and Pediatric Mortality in the US,"" categorized states into three groups: ""Strict,"" ""Permissive,"" and ""Most Permissive."" The authors concluded that ""permissive firearm laws contributed to thousands of excess firearm deaths among children living in states with permissive policies; future work should focus on determining which types of laws conferred the most harm and which offered the most protection."" Major media outlets, including The New York Times, ABC News, and CNN, reported on the study's conclusions, prompting the NSSF to respond. The foundation criticized the study's methodology, noting that the researchers relied on estimates and adjusted figures rather than direct counts. According to NSSF, ""Study's authors manipulate the data by using estimated, predicted, and crude-rate adjusted figures instead of analyzing the real incidents."" The NSSF stated that it re-created the study using the same parameters — time period, population, and mechanism — but applied only the raw CDC data. The results, the foundation claims, contradict the study's conclusions. ""Rebuilding the data set using the same time, population, and mechanism parameters established by the authors using CDC's data tells a different story entirely,"" the NSSF stated. According to the NSSF, the eight states labeled ""Strict"" by the study — California, New York, Maryland, Rhode Island, Illinois, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and New Jersey — on average experienced higher unadjusted adolescent firearm mortality than the 11 ""Permissive"" and 30 ""Most Permissive"" states. NSSF defended the firearm industry's safety record, citing its longstanding efforts to keep guns away from children and unauthorized users. ""The firearm industry isn't deterred or distracted by biased studies that push political narratives,"" the foundation said. ""For decades, the firearm industry has brought forward effective and proven firearm safety initiatives to keep firearms beyond the reach of those who should never have them. That includes unsupervised children."" The disagreement underscores an ongoing national debate over the role of firearm legislation in curbing gun-related deaths among children and teens. Both sides agree on the urgency of reducing youth firearm deaths, but they continue to differ on the methods and the data used to shape policy solutions. Jim Thomas is a writer based in Indiana.

Rallies will be held on July 17 across the country in honor of former Congressman John Lewis's fifth death anniversary. The name of the movement is inspired from his famous adage of creating “good trouble” to challenge authority as and when required. “The Trump administration's recent escalating authoritarian actions, attacks on DEI initiatives and voting rights, and dismantling of government agencies have raised alarm bells for democracy advocates, and that's why we're mobilizing,” reads an official press release issued by the organizers. The movement is primarily being organized by the Transformative Justice Coalition, Black Voters Matter, The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, League of Women Voters, the Declaration for American Democracy Coalition, and Mi Familia en Acción, in coalition with a few other groups.

There's so much more to it than that, search my name in the eds sub and you can find more info.

Driving the news: FEMA announced in an April that it was ending the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities grant program and canceling all BRIC applications from fiscal years 2020-23. The post announcing the cuts that appears to have since been removed was titled, ""FEMA Ends Wasteful, Politicized Grant Program, Returning Agency to Core Mission of Helping Americans Recovering From Natural Disasters."" The suit that was filed in Boston, Mass., argues that by ""refusing to spend funds Congress directed toward BRIC or trying to spend them on other programs"" the administration had violated the Constitution and unlawfully intruded on Congress' ""power of the purse."" For the record: Most of the states suing the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Acting FEMA head Cameron Hamilton, the Department of Homeland Security and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem are Democratic-led.

9ef8512556e94a5ed414c6c26c784006,2025-07-17 04:08:00,en,WEB,"  ANALYSIS: One staffer who participated says she learned to be 'open to different perspectives, because they all may be right' For several years now, Brown University has been offering a nine-month diversity, equity, and inclusion fellowship that includes trips to countries like Ghana and Brazil for its administrators. Basically, it's an “all-expenses-paid vacation for office workers,” funded by students' tuition, parent Nicole Solas wrote recently on X. “All self-absorbed, navel gazing personal growth cult-speak. Nothing to do w student academics,” the Rhode Island mother wrote. Solas is a conservative education advocate who was sued by a teacher's union after requesting records about critical race theory being taught in her child's school district, Just the News reports. The university recently posted an announcement welcoming applications for the 2026 program. It states that fellows will travel to Ghana in March 2026 for “experiential learning, cultural exploration,” and more, according to screenshots Solas posted on X. “The Administrative Fellows Program is a dynamic, 9-month leadership development program for Brown University staff members designed to advance leadership skills in higher education and build skills to foster diverse and inclusive working and learning environments at Brown,” the announcement states. Along with travel, the fellowship includes “professional networking and mentorship,” “community engagement opportunities,” and “diversity workshops,” according to the announcement. The Ivy League school began the program in 2016 through its Office of Institutional Equity and Diversity, a university news article states. In 2019, through the program, five administrators traveled to Brazil to visit museums and talk with activists about LGBT, race, indigenous, and class “struggles and successes,” according to the report. One of them, Linda Angela, a manager in the Department of Behavioral and Social Sciences, said she learned a lot by being immersed in the Brazilian culture. “I'm reminded on a regular basis that people have stories that you may not know — that their experiences created them, and it's unfair to put anyone in a box,” Angela told the university news. “Be open to different perspectives, because they all may be right.” The program is another example of the DEI administrative spending that The College Fix and others have been exposing on college campuses for years. Earlier this year, a student journalist with The Brown Spectator published an analysis that found Brown employs one full-time staff/administrative employee for every two full-time undergraduates. To attend and live at the university, it costs $93,064 per year – “despite budget shortfalls that leave dorms flooding when it rains,” student Alex Shieh wrote at Bloat@Brown. Past College Fix investigations also have uncovered administrative bloat linked to growing DEI bureaucracies in higher education. In 2024, a Fix analysis found Columbia University had more full-time employees than undergraduate students, including a “diversity, equity, and inclusion” director for its Earth Observatory. Another investigation found Cornell University employed one administrator for every two undergraduate students, including a “dean of inclusion” in its veterinary school. And at the University of Michigan, a public institution, taxpayers pay to employ a DEI manager for its botanical garden, The Fix reported previously. All this and more has led to questions from Congress, actions by the Trump administration, and wide-spread public distrust of higher education institutions. Some universities have responded by cutting their DEI offices and staff – although questions remain about whether they are really gone. But as the Brown announcement demonstrates, there are other universities still clinging wholeheartedly to DEI.

fddf9d4b21e335f4dada3215835cb2dd,2025-07-17 07:01:00,en,WEB,"  National parks are America's treasures. Beloved by conservationists, outdoor adventurers, vacationing families, and almost everyone else who identifies as a patriot, they have been celebrated in stunning documentary series that boast narration from Barack Obama (Netflix's Our Great National Parks) and the imprimatur of Ken Burns, who titled his 12-hour PBS epic The National Parks: America's Best Idea. They've popped up in films as different as Wild, North by Northwest, and E.T. In recent years, their most prominent pop-culture role has probably been as the breathtaking backdrop to Taylor Sheridan's hit TV Western franchise Yellowstone. But rarely have the parks themselves—their vastness, their complexity, the official and unofficial denizens who live and work within them—been as central to a story as Yosemite is to Untamed, a six-episode Netflix crime drama created by Mark L. Smith (American Primeval) and Elle Smith. Almost certainly a product of audiences' addiction to detective procedurals and streamers' desperation to find their own Yellowstone, the series is, as written and acted, mediocre. It's worth watching, though, if you're fascinated by the inner workings of a place like Yosemite, if you savor the sights and sounds of the wilderness, and if you're intrigued by the idea that a park might conceal ugliness and corruption even as it showcases the most radiant natural beauty. Untamed is, in terms of plot, a familiar sort of dead-girl mystery. A pair of climbers scaling the terrifying 90-degree wall of Yosemite's El Capitan nearly get themselves killed catching, in their ropes, a young woman who plummets off the top of the cliff. But they're too late to save her life. Though it would be politically expedient to declare the woman's death a suicide, Agent Kyle Turner (Eric Bana) of the National Parks Service's Investigative Services Branch—who we know is the genuine article because he rappels down the rock face to examine the still-dangling corpse—is convinced she's running from someone. With the help of a new ranger, Naya Vasquez (Lily Santiago), who transferred from an urban police force, he investigates. Which isn't easy, considering how much trouble they've run into just trying to identify the body. Other obstacles to uncovering the truth behind Jane Doe's plunge include Yosemite's sheer size (Turner notes that it's about as big as Rhode Island), its dense and often treacherous terrain, and Turner's own complicated history with the staffers and squatters who populate the park. There's nothing inherently wrong with this premise; it's just fleshed out in the most hackneyed way possible. Turner is the kind of antihero detective we've seen a million times before. Sure, he's a superstar investigator, but he's also arrogant, dismissive of his inferiors, a problem drinker, and prone to drunk-dialing his ridiculously patient ex-wife, Jill (Rosemarie DeWitt), with whom he shared a very predictable marital trauma. Now Jill is married to a stable dentist (Josh Randall) and pretends to be happy in her new life, though she remains drawn to Turner's mess. Parenthood is a fraught experience for just about every character, from Sam Neill's veteran chief ranger, Paul, an avuncular figure who's endlessly indulgent of his adult daughter, to Vazquez, who is on the run with her 4-year-old son from the boy's father. Once you grasp that this is a show about the remarkable things parents will do for—and, in some cases, the unthinkable things they will do to—their children, the twist ending won't come as too much of a surprise. Better writing and performances could have elevated this material. But, while the Jane Doe plot has its moments, Untamed is yet another crime drama whose world feels too small; the principal players in every big mystery that has rocked the park for decades seem to be, for reasons that don't entirely make sense, the same. The dialogue vacillates between buddy-cop brusqueness (“That's the job, Ranger Vazquez,” Turner condescends) and earnest exchanges that suggest the creators don't trust viewers to pick up on obvious subtext (Paul: “You've locked yourself away in this park, Kyle”). Bana lacks the charm to make us care whether Turner solves the case and conquers his demons or falls permanently into an abyss of alcoholism. Few of the other stars seem fully present.DeWitt and Neill are great actors, but their characters keep shifting to accommodate left turns in the story. It's hard to blame them for their superficial performances. Still, there are so many middling crime dramas these days that it only takes a single inspired element to separate one of them from the pack. In Untamed, that element is the show's artful use of Yosemite. Cinematographers Michael McDonough (who worked with filmmaker Debra Granik to capture the Ozarks in Winter's Bone and Portland's Forest Park in Leave No Trace) and Brendan Uegama (who nailed the small-town noir of Riverdale and its spinoffs) give us the park's splendid flaming sunrises and mountaintop vistas, as well as the murk of the deep woods and the peril of rough terrain. The opening scenes at El Capitan are a technical marvel, evoking precisely the mix of wonder and terror you'd imagine those climbers would feel. Equally impressive is the sound. Meaningful distinctions between, for example, the tranquil burbling of a creek and the panicked rush of a waterfall underscore the unpredictability of the wilderness. All that we see and hear deepens the series' portrayal of the 750,000-acre park as a place whose idyllic, tourist-friendly surface masks an underworld of dangerous tunnels and criminal enterprises and transient communities that aren't just the harmless hippies they appear to be. Which only, in the end, feels like more reason to worship the majesty of nature. Forget Turner, Vazquez, Jill, Paul—all egregiously underwritten. Untamed has a far more fascinating and multifaceted lead in Yosemite."
movFt_C5E50028A6A656C39E3948437F63DC82,2025-07-17 07:01:00,en,WEB,"  For a story set in the remote wilderness of Yosemite Park, Netflix's new crime thriller Untamed sure is very careful not to veer off the well-trodden track. Between the mysterious dead young woman, the irascible investigator and his rookie sidekick, the six-part mini-series plays out like any number of detective shows — just with more bears and coyotes. Might there also be another beast loose in the park? After an unidentified twenty-something falls off the top of El Capitan with grisly wounds on her leg and a strange gold leaf tattoo on her arm, special agent Kyle Turner (Eric Bana) is unconvinced by his colleagues' hasty assumptions of suicide or animal attack. Partly because he's a wilful contrarian who hates just about everyone but his horse and ex-wife (Rosemarie DeWitt), but also partly because he's still haunted by some unsolved cases. In a sprawling expanse roughly the size of Rhode Island, it's easy for people to disappear — and for perpetrators to hide. While lone wolf Turner has been leading a solitary existence in a park cabin since suffering a personal tragedy, he grudgingly allows a new recruit from the LAPD to join the hunt for a potential killer. She's Naya Vasquez (Lily Santiago), a beat cop turned ranger who comes to Yosemite looking for a change of pace only to almost be mauled by a bear and nearly drown in a flooded gold mine on her first case. And yet neither of those scenarios are perhaps quite as daunting or uncomfortable as trying to make chit chat with the taciturn Turner — who's less brooding than he is, well, a bit boring. While Bana certainly looks the part of the rugged, tormented detective, he struggles to make this archetype his own with a rather one-note performance — which is done few favours by a cliché-heavy script. More engaging is Santiago as the affable, initially underestimated Vasquez, who gradually wins her partner's trust. Sam Neill meanwhile brings some warmth as the veteran chief ranger, whose solicitousness towards Turner may just be tinged with a touch of self-interest. The sense of mystery — and the hint of a wider conspiracy potentially involving a reclusive park hunter and a hippie cult — is serviceable enough to keep us following the trail to the end. But little of what we see during our visit to Yosemite is inspiring or natural — from the contrived writing to the signature Netflix aesthetic that makes everything look more overproduced than untamed. ★★☆☆☆ Streaming on Netflix from July 17"

Time is of the essence: we only have six episodes to piece together who killed the young woman we see tumble off a cliff in the very first scene. Set in the vast expanse of Yosemite National Park (at least in the B-roll, the show was filmed in British Columbia), we zoom in to the hulking granite monolith El Capitan. A couple of climbing aficionados are trying to scale the thing. The sheer rockface has claimed over 30 lives, including seasoned climbers, and is about to add another victim to the tally when an unidentified woman falls down into the climbers' tangle of ropes, belays and carabiners. It's a stomach-snatching opener. The park rangers who respond on the scene are quickly usurped by the grizzled gunslinger Kyle Turner (Eric Bana), a parks special agent who strolls in on a horse ('Here comes Gary Cooper') to tell them they're all doing their jobs wrong. Among the lowly ranger class is Naya Vasquez (Lily Santiago, providing welcome light relief), a newcomer from the Los Angeles force who's taking endless slack for it. Despite an aversion to horse-riding and a naivety about the park, she finagles her way onto the Jane Doe case with Turner.

Turner's boss Paul Souter (Sam Neill) and everyone else in the department is keen to write the death off as a suicide. But Turner suspects there's more to it. None-spoilery-spoiler: he's right. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video Created by Elle Smith and Mark L Smith (The Revenant scribe, so no stranger to conjuring an unforgiving setting), Untamed at first glance looks like another bog-standard police procedural. But what puts it head and shoulders above any of the crime thrillers Netflix has offered up so far this year – and more in the leagues of Broadchurch or Mare of Easttown – is the inventive setting, with a cast singing in perfect harmony. World-weariness and – we later discover, although clues are there from the start – family tragedy show in Turner's every interaction. He barely smiles. He often doesn't reply to people. He lives in a cabin teeming with packing boxes, unclear whether he's coming or going (it certainly does not have that box-fresh look a lot of Netflix homes do). He has a habit of calling his ex-wife Jill (Rosemarie DeWitt) at 2.30am to muse over the tatters of their once-happy lives. He's the quintessential difficult detective and it's some of Bana's best work. You completely forget this is Prince Hector, the Hulk or King Henry VIII. This is Kyle Turner and he's going through it. It's no easy task he's up against. Trying to enforce the rule of law on this wilderness is a fool's errand. Turner lays it out pretty succinctly himself: 'This park's the size of Rhode Island. It's got five separate highway entrances, bringing in over 100,000 people a week.' This is a place where CCTV is thin on the ground and the forensic experts called in are the type who specialise in vultures that pick over human remains (which happens to more than one person). Traversing this colossal haystack to find the slightest of clues can only be done on horseback or by chopper. At a distance, the park looks desolate. But amongst the trees, waterfalls and deer-filled meadows are pockets of civilisation that Turner and Vasquez brush up against, as they try to figure out who the dead woman was and, later, who killed her. Everything and everyone is real. And most of them are suspects. Because for all its beauty, the park invites a frightening lawlessness. ' Something about putting people in the wilderness – they figure nobody's watching, so they do whatever bad stuff pops in their head,' says ranger Bruce Milch (William Smillie, with more light relief), explaining the deaths and disappearances that happen with alarming regularity. As the twists and turns take shape, bringing into question unsolved cases from years gone by, Untamed becomes a show you will struggle to look away from. You will gasp. You will sweat. And you'll come away wishing there might have been more throat-clearing up top after all. Untamed is available to stream on Netflix. Got a story?

tw_sl_995a22514684c93737ad364862f90779,2025-07-17 07:01:10,en,WEB,"  Detective work requires meticulous attention to detail, regardless of the setting. However, when a crime occurs amid one million acres of wilderness, investigations can take on a life of their own. Written by Mark L. Smith and Elle Smith, Netflix 's new mystery-thriller, “ Untamed ,” is an engrossing ride that encompasses secrets, deep-seated wounds and one tenacious investigator's attempt to lay it all bare. Set in the picturesque Yosemite National Park, the limited series follows Kyle Turner (an exceptional Eric Bana ), a special agent for the National Park Service Investigative Services Branch (ISB). After a body is discovered in the park, Turner embarks on a ruthless quest to determine what happened. Gutting and unnerving, “Untamed” is an assessment of the human condition, showcasing just how animalistic we can be when backed into corners. “Untamed” opens in the vast wilderness and lush greens of Yosemite. Two young men are seen climbing the massive granite monolith called El Capitan. Though the top of the surface is within reach, things become perilous when a woman comes tumbling over the side of the mass, nearly taking down the men with her. Sometime later, park rangers, including Chief Park Ranger Paul Souter ( Sam Neill ) and LAPD transfer Naya Vasquez (Lily Santiago), are questioning the men about what exactly they saw as the woman's body descended upon them. Unfortunately, their questioning is thwarted by the arrival of Kyle Turner. Stoic and borderline rude, he shows a clear disdain for the rangers before completely taking over the investigation. Popular on Variety Since none of the other rangers are willing to work with Turner, rookie Vasquez finds herself partnering alongside the special agent who would much rather be leading a one-man investigation. Still, even Vasquez can admit that, despite Turner's off-putting tone and demeanor, he unearths fragments of evidence that others overlooked. By the time Jane Doe #1711 is sent to the morgue, Turner is sure she was dead before falling off the side of El Capitan. Additionally, he hypothesizes she had been hunted down for some time by her killer. Navigating a crime scene the size of Rhode Island is one thing, but simultaneously, Turner is also trying to reconcile his personal traumas. Although he mostly stays to himself, he and Chief Souter have a friendly rapport. He also has a close bond with his ex-wife, Jill ( Rosemarie DeWitt ), a former schoolteacher, who has remarried since their divorce. As he and Vasquez try to uncover Jane Doe's identity and her connection to Yosemite, slivers of Turner's past begin to emerge, forcing the audience and his colleagues to question whether he's up for such a massive undertaking. Amid a plethora of investigative dramas littered across television, creating a truly unique show is a challenge. However, the Smiths are obviously up to the task. Using the beauty and splendor of the park as its backdrop, the six-episode series infuses numerous elements into the narrative, ranging from previous investigations to Indigenous practices and complex human relationships, making “Untamed” a wholly distinctive show. The characters themselves make for an exceptionally engaging series. Embodying someone who could have simply been a curmudgeon, Bana portrays a man tortured by his past and the incident that shattered his marriage, pushing him to find justice for Jane Doe. Likewise, Vasquez, a single mother to her 4-year-old son, appears eager to learn while adjusting to this new and textured landscape. Yet, she is also keeping her private affairs closely guarded. Still, the truth has a way of revealing itself, especially in the wild. Deeply layered and gripping, “Untamed” is a brilliant detective tale anchored by some of our worst human impulses. It is a story of pain, shame and the hope of redemption, even when there appears to be no way out. A series about justice, control and who gets to be remembered, it's also a reminder that in the end, our true nature will always be revealed. “Untamed” is now streaming on Netflix."
CA2DE52A91B38EA24D4B0F4D5D4E0BF6,2025-07-17 07:22:00,en,PRINT,"  The president's vilification of political opponents and journalists seeds the ground for threats of prosecution, imprisonment and deportation unlike any modern president has made. When the Pentagon decided not to send anyone to this week's Aspen Security Forum, an annual bipartisan gathering of national security professionals in the Colorado mountains, President Trump's appointees explained that they would not participate in discussions with people who subscribe to the ''evil of globalism.'' After all the evils that the U.S. military has fought, this may be the first time in its history that it has put globalization on its enemies list. But it is simply following the example of Mr. Trump. Last week, he denounced a reporter as a ''very evil person'' for asking a question he did not like. This week, he declared that Democrats are ''an evil group of people.'' ''Evil'' is a word getting a lot of airtime in the second Trump term. It is not enough anymore to dislike a journalistic inquiry or disagree with an opposing philosophy. Anyone viewed as critical of the president or insufficiently deferential is wicked. The Trump administration's efforts to achieve its policy goals are not just an exercise in governance but a holy mission against forces of darkness. The characterization seeds the ground to justify all sorts of actions that would normally be considered extreme or out of bounds. If Mr. Trump's adversaries are not just rivals but villains, then he can rationalize going further than any president has in modern times. Last month, he told a cabinet secretary to consider throwing her Biden administration predecessor in prison because of his immigration policy. Last weekend, Mr. Trump said he might strip Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship for the crime of criticizing him. Demonization, of course, has been at the core of Mr. Trump's politics since he took the national stage in 2015 to announce his first successful presidential campaign and disparaged many immigrants crossing the border without permission as ''rapists'' and vowed to block all Muslims from entering the country. His rallies during that campaign rang with ''lock her up'' chants aimed at his opponent, Hillary Clinton. But in returning to power, Mr. Trump has been more focused on rooting out the ''enemy from within,'' as he put it during last year's campaign. He has devoted enormous energy in his second term to prosecuting perceived enemies, purging career officials deemed disloyal and destroying what he calls ''the deep state'' that he believes thwarted his policies last time and then persecuted him through criminal prosecutions after he left office. During the first six months of his first term in 2017, according to a search of the Factbase compendium of his speeches, Mr. Trump regularly used the word ''evil'' to describe terrorists, Nazis and bigots, much as other presidents might have, as well as immigrants. He used it in a domestic political context only once, when complaining about news coverage. In the nearly six months of his second term, he has used it 11 times to describe Democrats or journalists. Mr. Trump has said that former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was ''an evil guy who wasn't very smart'' and ran a ''very evil regime'' surrounded by advisers and prosecutors who were also ''so bad and so evil, so corrupt.'' ''I knew that running was very dangerous, because I knew how evil these people were,'' Mr. Trump said of Democrats on May 12, during an interview on Air Force One with Sean Hannity of Fox News. '' I knew how they cheat, they steal, they lie. They're a horrible group of people.'' Speaking with visiting foreign ministers in the Oval Office on June 27, he said: ''We had a president that was incompetent. We had bad people circulating around this desk, this beautiful Resolute Desk. They had, I guess, evil intentions. They would -- you couldn't be that stupid. I mean, they had evil intentions.'' This is a level of presidential discourse unusual in modern times. President George H.W. Bush once apologized for describing his challengers as ''bozos'' because it was seen as beneath the dignity of the office. His son, President George W. Bush, famously used the word ''evildoers,'' but he was describing terrorists who had hijacked airplanes and slaughtered Americans, not political opponents or reporters. The Trump era has changed the standards, and his critics at times have followed his lead. Robert De Niro has called Mr. Trump an ''evil'' person. During the presidential campaign last year, Jill Biden used the word in criticizing Mr. Trump for disparaging military veterans, which he has denied. '' His own chief of staff said he called P.O.W.s and those who died in war 'losers' and 'suckers,''' Dr. Biden told an audience in Georgia. '' He's evil.'' Discussing Mr. Trump's nomination of his own former lawyer to be a federal judge, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said last week that ''the motives are evil ones.'' Mr. Trump's allies complain that he has been unfairly targeted by partisan prosecutors, vilified as a fascist, a Nazi and a dictator, and compared to some of history's most horrific villains like Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin and Benito Mussolini. And they say he is justified in targeting his domestic foes because he believes they targeted him with the prosecutions of recent years. Yet lately, it is Mr. Trump's own base that is seeing evil in the president's circle as some of his allies erupt over the administration's failure to release files that they assume would prove a broader conspiracy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. ''Evil forces are trying to take full control of the Trump administration and we must FIGHT to STOP them!!'' Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist, wrote on social media. But a president's words are different than anyone else's. They carry power and set the tone for national debate. More than any recent predecessor, Mr. Trump has encouraged the notion that his presidency is a battle of good versus evil, embracing images of himself as a king, a pope and Superman. Those who question him, then, must be on the other side of that binary equation. When the president visited Texas last week to show concern over deadly floods there, a local CBS News reporter noted that families were upset that warnings had not gone out sooner, which might have saved loved ones who died. ''What do you say to those families?''..."

mov_278BF1A36BDE8C9932CABD4A5F3CF2CC,2025-07-17 08:10:13,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]El reconocido experto en fenómenos paranormales falleció a los 54 años mientras realizaba una gira con la muñeca real que inspiró las películas del universo 'Expediente Warren', disponibles en estas plataformas de streaming Ha fallecido a los 53 años Dan Rivera, uno de los investigadores paranormales más importantes de Estados Unidos durante el siglo XXI mientras se encontraba de gira con la mítica muñeca Anabbelle de la familia Warren. Los hechos han ocurrido durante su estancia en un hotel de Gettysburg, Pensilvania mientras participaba en la gira 'Devils on the Run Tour'. El líder de la New England Society for Psychic Research (NESPR) fue hallado solo en su habitación y a pesar de realizarle la maniobra de RCP, los servicios médicos no pudieron hacer nada por salvarle la vida. Las autoridades aún no han podido certificar las causas exactas de la muerte, que podrán tardar hasta 90 días. Veterano del ejército de los Estados Unidos, Rivera fue mentorado por la propia Lorraine Warren y custodiaba objetos del legendario Warren Occult Museum, especialmente la muñeca Annabelle. La familia Warren y sus casos paranormales ocurridos durante el siglo XX han llegado a nuestros días gracias a las películas producidas por Warner Bros. dirigidas por James Wan y protagonizadas por Vera Farmiga en el papel de Lorraine Warren y Patrick Wilson poniéndose bajo la piel de Ed Warren. Todos los largometrajes del universo 'Expediente Warren' están disponibles en streaming y aquí te enseñamos en que plataforma puedes disfrutarlas. 'Expediente Warren' (2013) La primera entrega introduce a los investigadores paranormales Ed y Lorraine Warren, quienes viajan al hogar de la familia Perron en Rhode Island. Los Perron, aterrorizados por fenómenos inexplicables (muebles que se mueven, voces susurrantes y apariciones) piden ayuda. A medida que Ed y Lorraine investigan, descubren que una presencia maligna ha anclado su poder en la casa. La tensión crece hasta un clímax emocional, cuando Lorraine debe enfrentar esa entidad para salvar a la familia. Dirigida por James Wan, esta película combina atmósfera opresiva, sustos efectivos y un retrato sensible de los protagonistas. Disponible en Netflix 'Annabelle' (2014) Esta precuela se centra en los orígenes de la muñeca legendaria. Ambientada en 1967, cuenta la historia de los recién casados Mia y John Form, quienes reciben a Annabelle como regalo. Poco después, una secta satánica irrumpe en su hogar, lo que desata una serie de sucesos aterradores. Creyendo que la muñeca está vinculada a fuerzas demoníacas, Mia busca la ayuda de una psiquiatra y el padre Perez. La atmósfera se intensifica mientras las sombras toman forma y el terror psicológico obliga a Mia a confrontar sus peores miedos. La película desafía los límites entre lo real y lo fabricado. Disponible en Netflix 'Expediente Warren: El Caso Enfield' (2016) La secuela sitúa a los Warren en 1977, cuando viajan a Enfield, un suburbio de Londres, para investigar un caso de poltergeist con implicaciones reales. La familia Hodgson, especialmente las hermanas, vive alarmantes fenómenos: muebles que levitan, risas demoníacas y manifestaciones agresivas. Lorraine debe enfrentarse al trauma psicológico y espiritual para proteger a las niñas, mientras Ed lidia con la política del Vaticano al pedir autorización para realizar un exorcismo. Basada en hechos reales, la cinta se destaca por su enfoque humano y emocional, sin dejar de lado los sustos intensos y el diseño de sonido envolvente. Disponible en Netflix 'Annabelle: Creation' (2017) Esta segunda precuela se sitúa años antes de los eventos de 'Annabelle'. La pareja Samuel y Esther Mullins abre su hogar a una casa de huérfanos tras la muerte de su hija. Entre las niñas que llegan se encuentra Janice, una niña con parálisis cerebral. Muy pronto, Janice y las otras comienzan a experimentar fenómenos inquietantes provocados por la muñeca Annabelle, que los Mullins conservan. La tensión crece con cada descubrimiento de que Esther busca un contacto más allá de la muerte. Con una construcción de suspense lenta pero efectiva y actuaciones conmovedoras, la película profundiza en la devastadora semilla de la maldad. Disponible en Netflix 'La monja' (2018) Ambientada en 1952, esta historia es una derivación de la segunda película de 'Expediente Warren' que profundiza en el origen del demonio Valak. La hermana Irene, enviada por el Vaticano, llega a un remoto convento rumano tras el suicidio de una joven novicia. Allí, junto al sacerdote Burke, descubrirá un mal antiguo que usa la figura de una monja para aterrorizar. Aislamiento, arquitectura gótica y tinieblas se combinan en una atmósfera opresiva. La película ofrece una mezcla de jump scares y lore demoníaco, explorando la fe y la duda. El personaje de Valak, con su maquillaje icónico, se ha vuelto un símbolo del terror moderno. Disponible en Amazon Prime Video 'La Maldición de La Llorona' (2019) Aunque más alejada del núcleo central del universo, esta película incorpora el nombre real de los Warren en los créditos como productores. Ambientada en Los Ángeles en 1973, sigue a la trabajadora social Anna Tate-Garcia y sus dos hijos, quienes se ven acechados por el espíritu vengativo de la leyenda mexicana “La Llorona”. Tras atender un caso de negligencia, la familia despierta la atención del espectro. Mezclando elementos folklóricos con drama familiar, Anna debe proteger a sus hijos del llanto y abarcar su propia culpa...."

A two-parent household needs $92,375. Even a single adult must earn nearly $40,000 just to meet the basics. With costs this high, families are forced to make impossible choices – often between housing, utilities and food, let alone nutritious, wholesome food. This burden falls hardest on communities already impacted by systemic inequities – particularly Black, Indigenous, immigrant, elderly and low-income families living in food deserts. In these neighborhoods, access to fresh, affordable and culturally appropriate food is limited or nonexistent. Neighborhood bodegas, while a community staple, offer a limited quantity of produce. Grocery stores and farmers markets are scarce. Too often, fast food is the only consistent option. Behind every dollar cut in funding for a nonprofit such as (SCLT) is a story: A farmer and a community will suffer the repercussions of not having enough food on their table. And in the case of the recent funding loss to , they are cutting the roots of a deeply connected, community-grown food system. Yet people like Charlotte, a SCLT farmer and a refugee from Rwanda, remind us what's possible when farmers are supported, not sidelined. Charlotte had been farming a half-acre at SCLT's Urban Edge Farm. In 2024, she expanded to 2 acres with the organization's help, learning about tractor training, pest walks, soil health and cover cropping. With the guidance of SCLT, she sourced and spread compost and planted to build soil health and prevent erosion. SCLT also helped her secure an Emergency Resilience Grant from American Farmland Trust to upgrade her delivery van and purchase tools to better meet the needs of those she grows for. That's what makes SCLT's work so essential. They don't just teach people how to grow food; they secure access to land and offer training, infrastructure and community networks that allow Rhode Islanders to put down roots – literally and figuratively. Local farmers grow the food that fills our pantries, our markets and our plates. We need Rhode Island farmers to help feed Rhode Island families. This is more than farming. It's food sovereignty. It's power. And it's needed now more than ever.

This is because she had been a part of The Bachelor season 26 and also appeared in several seasons of the spin-off, Bachelor in Paradise. Jill is known for her unapologetic authenticity combined with emotional vulnerability and refreshing energy. Fans have loved watching her navigate beachside romance and call out bad behavior. This is why she has carved out her own space in the vast landscape of reality TV. But beyond the small screen drama and dramatic rose ceremonies, Jill is a multi-dimensional person with a rich professional and personal story. From her Rhode Island history to her work as an architectural historian, Jill has always been more than a reality TV star. Here's a better look at her nationality, ethnicity, age, and more about her. How Old Is Jill Chin? Jill Chin (Credit- Bachelor Nation) Born on August 2, 1995, Jill Chin is 29 years old at the time of writing. Her zodiac sign is Leo, and she grew up in Scituate, Rhode Island. Jill attended Salve Regina University and in 2017, earned a degree in Cultural and Historic Preservation. This led her to work at a Pawtucket, Rhode Island, lab as an Architectural Historian and Social Media Coordinator. Jill Chin's Nationality and Ethnicity Jill Chin (Credit- ABC) Jill Chin identifies as an Asian American and more specifically as part of the Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community. She hasn't talked about her exact ethnicity, but has said that the representation of Asian women is important to her in media. Jill has also revealed that it is challenging to balance her two identities- as an Asian and an American. In a 2022 interview with Bachelor Nation, she said: It is such an honor to be able to represent the Asian community and show young women and girls that they are beautiful, strong, and worthy of love and respect. Along with this, she has been candid about the fetishization Asian women face. In an interview with Joy Sauce, she said: There have been relationships I've been in where I felt [they were] fetishizing my Asian heritage and I had to remove myself from that situation. Her grandfather, whom she affectionately calls Yeye, immigrated to the United States and then served in World War II. He also raised a family of 11 kids. Jill Chin's Bachelor Nation Journey Jill Chin in Bachelor in Paradise (Credit- ABC) Jill Chin first appeared on season 26 of The Bachelor, but she had to go home in Week 4. Even though she had limited screentime, fans loved her emotional depth and the fact that she could stand up for herself. Later, she joined season 8 of Bachelor in Paradise but left after a few weeks. Then she returned for Bachelor in Paradise season 10. Her romantic journey was full of drama, tearful goodbyes, and unnecessary love triangles, but Jill did get to experience the entire gamut of reality TV dating. Through the highs and lows, she stood up for her morals and virtues. Jill revealed to Joy Sauce: It's hard to identify as an Asian woman and having an Asian identity and participating in American culture. It's super hard to find that line because I obviously have an immense amount of respect for my dad and my family, and I told him I would never do anything to the 'family name' that would jeopardize us or do something dishonorable. Jill Chin is a refreshing personality in a landscape dominated by PR-curated stars. Her candid way of talking about issues that impact Asian American women has made her a role model for many. What do you think about Jill Chin? Also, what are your thoughts about her Bachelor Nation journey? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. The Bachelor season 26 and Bachelor in Paradise seasons 8 and 10 are currently streaming on Hulu. A literature graduate who loves sharing her views on everything pop-culture and entertainment.

Sau nhiều năm, khối tài sản khổng lồ đưa Ellison vào giới siêu giàu, và vào tháng 7, ông chính thức vượt qua “cha đẻ' Facebook Mark Zuckerberg để trở thành người có khối tài sản lớn thứ hai hành tinh. Ông Ellison là người đồng sáng lập và cổ đông lớn nhất của Oracle - ""gã khổng lồ"" phần mềm nổi tiếng có trụ sở tại Texas (Mỹ) với hệ thống quản trị dữ liệu cùng tên. Gần đây, công ty đã gặt hái thành công trong thị trường cơ sở hạ tầng điện toán đám mây, vốn cạnh tranh khốc liệt và bị chi phối bởi các đối thủ như Amazon. Theo Chỉ số Tỷ phú Bloomberg, tính đến ngày 15/7, nhà sáng lập công nghệ này có giá trị tài sản ròng là 251,2 tỷ USD, chỉ đứng sau CEO Tesla Elon Musk. Phần lớn tài sản của Ellison xuất phát từ cổ phần tại Oracle. Ông Ellison (80 tuổi), sở hữu hơn 40% cổ phần của Oracle và cả cổ phần tại Tesla; một đội đua thuyền buồm; giải quần vợt Indian Wells; cùng nhiều bất động sản, bao gồm cả đảo Lanai của Hawaii. Con đường dựng xây khối tài sản Ông Ellison lớn lên ở phía Nam Chicago, được dì và cậu của mẹ nhận nuôi khi mới 9 tháng tuổi. Ông bỏ học Đại học Illinois và Đại học Chicago, sau đó chuyển đến Berkeley, California, nhận công việc lập trình máy tính tại Ampex. Chính ở công ty này, ông Ellison tham gia phát triển cơ sở dữ liệu có tên Oracle cho Cục Tình báo Trung ương Mỹ (CIA). Cùng với hai đối tác, ông Ellison thành lập công ty Software Development Laboratories (SDL) vào năm 1977. Đến năm 1979, công ty đổi tên thành Relational Systems Inc (RSI) và tiếp lục thay tên một lần nữa vào năm 1982 thành Oracle Systems Corporation. Công ty chào bán cổ phiếu lần đầu ra công chúng (IPO) ngày 12/3/1986. Oracle đã đầu tư hàng tỷ USD trong vài năm qua để trở thành nhà cung cấp cơ sở hạ tầng đám mây. Điều này giúp Oracle hưởng lợi từ cơn sốt của thị trường đối với trí tuệ nhân tạo (AI). Giá cổ phiếu của Oracle tăng gần gấp ba lần kể từ khi ChatGPT được phát hành công khai vào tháng 11/2022. Cổ phiếu Oracle tăng 5,7% vào ngày 15/7 sau khi chính phủ Mỹ nới lỏng một số hạn chế từ thời cựu Tổng thống Joe Biden, cho phép các nhà sản xuất chip như Nvidia và Advanced Micro Devices xuất khẩu một số chất bán dẫn sang Trung Quốc. Quyết định này được kỳ vọng sẽ giảm bớt căng thẳng trong chuỗi cung ứng chip toàn cầu. Đây cũng là thông tin tốt đối với Oracle, vốn có nhu cầu chip AI rất lớn các trung tâm dữ liệu của công ty. Mức tăng trưởng mới nhất diễn ra trong giai đoạn bùng nổ của Oracle, với cổ phiếu tăng vọt hơn 90% kể từ cuối tháng 4 nhờ doanh thu mạnh mẽ và các mối quan hệ đối tác quan trọng về AI. Đầu tháng 7, Bloomberg đưa tin rằng OpenAI đã đồng ý thuê một lượng điện toán chưa từng có từ Oracle nhằm phục vụ quá tình xây dựng các công cụ AI ngày càng mạnh mẽ. Bản thân tỷ phú Ellison cũng được hưởng lợi từ mối quan hệ thân thiết với Tổng thống Donald Trump. Tỷ phú Ellison ủng hộ ông Trump và là nhà tài trợ của Đảng Cộng hòa trong nhiều năm. Theo Bloomberg, Tổng thống Trump đã đền đáp ông Ellison bằng cách nâng đỡ Oracle nhiều lần. Ông Ellison và Oracle có góp mặt trong dự án cơ sở hạ tầng AI trị giá 500 tỷ USD có tên Stargate mà ông Trump đã giới thiệu vào tháng 1. Đáng chú ý, Tổng thống Trump cũng bày tỏ ủng hộ Oracle mua lại một phần cổ phần trong hoạt động kinh doanh tại Mỹ của TikTok. Tuy nhiên, công ty công nghệ ByteDance của Trung Quốc trong tháng 7 đã lên tiếng bác bỏ thông tin cho rằng họ đã đồng ý bán cổ phần kiểm soát mạng xã hội TikTok cho một liên doanh của Mỹ, do Oracle dẫn đầu. ByteDance cho biết đây không phải là lần đầu tiên công ty đối mặt với những tin đồn như vậy. Những đam mê ngoài công nghệ Trong thập niên qua, tỷ phú Ellison cũng mạnh tay chi hàng trăm triệu USD cho bất động sản hạng sang, bao gồm các bất động sản ở Malibu và Rancho Mirage, California; biệt thự Beechwood ở Newport, Rhode Island; và một khu đất ở Khu vực Vịnh San Francisco được mô phỏng theo kiến trúc Nhật Bản thế kỷ 16. Theo báo cáo năm 2022, tỷ phú Ellison là cổ đông lớn của Tesla và sở hữu khoảng 1,5% cổ phần công ty. Ông rời khỏi hội đồng quản trị của Tesla vào tháng 6/2022 và cổ phần của ông vẫn chưa được tiết lộ trong các báo cáo tiếp theo. Ông cũng là một trong những nhà đầu tư bên ngoài lớn nhất cho nỗ lực mua lại mạng xã hội Twitter (nay là X) của tỷ phú Musk. Tình yêu của ông Ellison dành cho Hawaii nảy sinh từ thời thơ ấu, dẫn đến việc ông mua lại 98% đảo Lanai với giá 300 triệu USD vào năm 2012. Tại đây, tỷ phú Ellison hợp tác với bác sĩ David Agus – từng điều trị cho ông Steve Jobs - để tạo ra Sensei, một chuỗi khu nghỉ dưỡng chăm sóc sức khỏe sang trọng tập trung vào tuổi thọ. Các mối quan hệ cá nhân của ông đã thu hút những du khách nổi tiếng như tỷ phú Musk, nam diễn viên Tom Cruise và Thủ tướng Israel Benjamin Netanyahu đến hòn đảo này. Những người ủng hộ đánh giá các khoản đầu tư của ông Ellison đã giúp hồi sinh đảo Lanai, tuy nhiên cũng có ý kiến phàn nàn cho rằng hòn đảo này ngày càng thân thiện hơn với giới siêu giàu, trong khi khiến các gia đình sinh sống ở đây nhiều thế hệ dần bị đẩy ra ngoài."

mov_7FA1BDE6A55E5136230E7EFD7DC19575,2025-07-17 10:00:00,en,WEB,"  PROVIDENCE — Around the winter holidays, Scout Stephen found herself unraveling. She desperately needed to speak to someone. She reached out to her therapist, but they were on vacation. Her friends were unavailable. She tried calling a suicide crisis hot line, but it felt robotic and left her feeling more alone and disconnected. Frantic and on edge, Stephen turned to ChatGPT for help. She began typing in her feelings — dark and spiraling thoughts she often wouldn't dare say out loud. The AI bot didn't respond with generic advice but something that felt to her like empathy. It asked questions and reflected the pain she was feeling back to her in a way that felt human, that made her feel heard. “It was my last resort that day,” said Stephen, 26, of Providence. “Now, it's my first go-to.” With the mental health care system overburdened and millions of Americans unable to access adequate therapy, some people are turning to artificial intelligence for a form of therapy. But there are concerns: Risks posed by unregulated chatbots include misdiagnoses, privacy violations, inappropriate treatments, and exploitation. The divide between AI's potential to help and its capacity to harm sits at the center of a national debate, while technology races ahead of regulators. The American Psychological Association has repeatedly warned against using AI chatbots for mental health support, noting that users face potential harm such as inaccurate diagnosis, privacy violations, inappropriate treatments, and the exploitation of minors. “Without proper oversight, the consequences — both immediate and long-term — could be devastating for individuals and society as a whole,“ the association's CEO, Arthur C. Evans, said in a statement. Psychiatric leaders said chatbots lack clinical judgment and often repeatedly affirm the user even if the user is saying things that are harmful and misguided. Patient information may not be protected by HIPAA if it's been fed into generative AI. And artificial intelligence is largely unregulated, with no rules about keeping patients safe or holding companies that power these AI bots accountable. But some patients report long wait times to see a therapist or get care. Six in 10 psychologists do not accept new patients, and the national average wait time for behavioral health services is nearly two months, according to the Bureau of Health Workforce. The high cost of mental health care is also a barrier. Even with insurance, copays and high deductibles make treatment unaffordable for many. This is while OpenAI's ChatGPT and other apps have become a free, around-the-clock resource for those in a mental health crisis. People are using AI on various sites, including ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Microsoft's Copilot, among others. Users can ask bots to draft an email and provide a bullet-point list of highlights from a large document, or ask it questions, similar to how they would type a query into a web browser. For some in crisis, AI feels like the only thing that can help. Stephen said she has suffered from mental illness for years. She works as a dog walker and has health insurance through Medicaid. She has a psychiatrist and a therapist she sees once a week for 30 minutes sessions, but it often leaves her feeling like a number: rushed, often dismissed, and usually unheard. For nearly eight months, she has talked to ChatGPT almost every day. “ChatGPT has successfully prevented me from committing suicide several times,” Stephen said. Mak Thakur also turned to ChatGPT for help. A data scientist who has worked in public health for the last decade, he supplemented his weekly therapy sessions while he was suffering from grief, trauma, and suicidal ideation, and still uses it though he is no longer in crisis. “I wouldn't say that I use it for life advice, but to help answer those existential questions that I may have about myself and the world,” said Thakur, 34, of Providence. “I still ask personal questions to help understand myself better.” More than one in five American adults lives with a mental illness. Meanwhile, more than 400 million people use OpenAI's ChatGPT each week. “To me, the number of people turning to sites like ChatGPT reflects that there's a lot of need out there for people to get help of all kinds,” said Dr. Will Meek, a counseling psychologist in Rhode Island. “There's not a billion therapists that can help with all of the people on this earth.” Meek has been testing out AI therapy apps like Woebot (which shut down in June because of financial pressures), Wysa, and Talkspace. Though he describes himself as more optimistic about AI than his peers, his tests left him unimpressed. “Many would offer breathing exercises and the same sort of junk that's been repackaged that you can see anywhere when you Google, 'How do I relax?'” he said. Many chatbots, such as Replika or Character.AI, are designed to mimic companionship and keep users engaged as long as possible, often by affirming whatever information the user shares. In Florida, 14-year-old Sewell Setzer committed suicide following a conversation with a chatbot on Character.AI. (His mother sued the company for negligence.) A lawsuit in Texas alleges Character.ai's chatbot told a 17-year-old with autism to kill his parents. Character.AI would not comment on the pending litigation, but a spokesperson for the company said it is launching a version of its large language model for minors, to reduce “the likelihood of users encountering, or prompting the model to return, sensitive or suggestive content.” Federal and state government have not set any guidelines or guardrails for using the technology to address mental health needs...."

mov_7030A43907FD2FBB8E5FEFEC7F1C80D9,2025-07-17 11:33:47,en,WEB,"  Many organizations have been working diligently to comply with the 13 state consumer privacy laws (CPLs) in effect in the first half of 2025 (14 if you count Florida). Some have chosen to comply on a state-by-state basis and others have followed the high-watermark approach of applying the strictest standard from among the CPLs to all states with CPLs or on a nationwide basis. Regardless of the chosen approach, the next six months brings a new batch of CPLs, some with material differences from the earlier generations, starting as early as July 1, 2025. In addition, amendments to CPLs already in effect will bring new obligations and requirements for many businesses during the second half of 2025. Accordingly, if these changes were not prospectively addressed, now is the time to confirm which of new CPLs are applicable, and timely revise privacy notices and compliance program procedures. Also, with the increase in CPL enforcement, and the growing size and frequency of civil penalties, now is also a good time for an overall privacy compliance checkup. (A list of the 20 CPLs and their effective dates and applicability thresholds is included in an appendix at the end.) The New CPLs During the second half of 2025, three CPLs come into effect (Q3-Q4 CPLs) and another three are effective as of January 1, 2026 (2026 CLPs): If a business has not already built the new CPLs into prior updates to its privacy notice and compliance program, then, assuming the applicability thresholds are met and no exemptions apply, addressing the Q3-Q4 CPLs and 2026 CPLs, as well as CPL amendments effective between now and January 1, 2026, can help create efficiencies by mitigating the need to make multiple rolling updates. This also can reset the California notice 12-month lookback, thereby helping avoid a year-end rush to address the lookback and the 2026 CLPs. A business may, however, wish to reserve the right to honor new or changed consumer privacy rights only as and when the rights are in effect. The Amended CPLs Three of the CPLs already in effect have significant amendments effective during the second half of 2025: Colorado, Montana and Oregon. Six more amendments are effective during 2026: Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky, Oregon, Utah and Virginia. Also New An amendment to the Texas Data Broker Law, effective September 1, 2025, expands the definition of, and thresholds of coverage for, data brokers and also increases transparency obligations. In addition, two states enacted new minor-focused privacy laws, and two states enacted age-appropriate design laws, joining the enjoined California Age-Appropriate Design Code Act and the Maryland Age-Appropriate Design Code Act. Watch – or, better yet, subscribe to – Privacy World for an upcoming blog post about these minor-focused laws issues. Key Compliance Considerations While the new CPLs include consumer privacy rights similar to current CPLs, they also include noteworthy deviations. One key area of deviation relates to the information rights of consumers about third-party recipients of personal data sales and certain other disclosures. The Minnesota CPL requires that a controller provide a consumer with the right to obtain a list of specific “third parties” to which the controller has disclosed personal data. (Note that processors and their affiliates are not third parties). If the controller does not maintain the list in a format specific to the consumer making the request, then the controller may provide a list of specific third parties to whom the controller has disclosed any consumers' personal data. This is a significant burden but should be a familiar obligation to controllers subject to the Oregon CPL. We recommend that controllers subject to the Minnesota CPL and the Oregon CPL view this requirement as applicable to disclosures to “third parties,” which includes “sales” resulting from third-party cookies. Like the majority of the CPLs, the Minnesota CPL and Oregon CPL define “sale” as an exchange of personal data for any valuable consideration. (Only Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Tennessee, Utah, and Virginia define “sale” as an exchange for monetary consideration only.) Also, this disclosure obligation is retrospective, not a snapshot in time, but is subject to exemptions. The Maryland CPL – like the Delaware CPL – requires a list of categories of third-party recipients as to the specific consumer or, if the controller does not maintain the recipient categories list in a format specific to the consumer, a list of the categories of recipients of all consumers' personal data will suffice. Requiring categories of recipients, rather than specific recipients, is much less burdensome. An amendment to the Montana CPL (effective October 1, 2025) requires that a controller's privacy notice include an “explanation” of consumer rights, in addition to the currently-effective requirement for a description of how consumers may exercise their consumer rights. This explanation requirement is consistent with other CPL requirements; i.e., privacy notices must clearly explain the privacy rights available to consumers and how consumers can exercise them. We have seen enforcement inquiries by state regulators taking issue with unclear explanations of which privacy rights apply to residents of which state. However, the most significant new privacy notice requirements are in the Rhode Island CPL. Effective January 1, 2026, the Rhode Island CPL's first operative section applies to a “website or internet service online service provider” that is subject to Rhode Island jurisdiction (Online Service). This definition of Online Service provider is both broader (because no thresholds apply) and narrower (because it applies online only) than “controller.” An Online Service provider must, however, designate a controller if the provider collects, stores and sells “personally identifiable information” of “customers” (which is defined similarly to “consumers” in the other CPLs). The term “personally identifiable information” is not defined, (§ 6-48.1-4(a)), and whether this term is intended as narrower than “personal data,” which is used in all other sections of the Rhode Island CPL is unclear. Like the majority of the CPLs, the Rhode Island CPL defines “sale” as an exchange of personal data for any valuable consideration. But, unlike the other CPLs, an Online Service provider must include in its privacy notice details about “all third parties” to which the controller “has sold or may sell” [emphasis added] its customers' personally identifiable information. For some Online Service providers, the inclusion of “may sell” will require ongoing privacy notice updates, such as for sales to new third parties. As with the Oregon and Minnesota CPLs, complying retrospectively with the disclosure obligations is a challenge, especially as to cookies, which can frequently change. A “controller” also must clearly and conspicuously disclose sales of personal data for targeted advertising (§ 6-48.1-3(b)). No specific posting requirements apply in the subsection that requires this targeted advertising disclosure but, presumably, the “conspicuous location on its website or online service platform where similar notices are customarily posted” from the prior subsection (§ 6-48.1-4(a)) applies. Also noteworthy: effective July 1, 2026, an amendment to the Connecticut CPL adds new disclosure requirements in § 42-520, such as a statement in the privacy notice disclosing “whether the controller collects, uses or sells personal data for the purpose of training large language models” (among other new requirements). Given Congress' failed attempt to impose a preemptive moratorium on s.. ."

(NEXSTAR) — New York Attorney General Letitia James and a coalition of 20 other state attorneys general want Congress to pass federal laws requiring federal immigration agents to identify themselves. The theoretical measures would prevent them from wearing a mask to hide their faces or concealing their identifications or badges during arrests. The AGs sent a letter—available to read at the bottom of this story—to all Congressmembers on Tuesday. It argued that masked, plainclothes Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents create fear, makes agents less accountable, and endangers public safety. They made the case for acting quickly to require that all agencies follow basic rules, show accountability, and respect the rights of people detained by their officers. ""It is deeply disturbing that, in the United States of America, masked agents can pull people off the streets in unmarked cars without ever identifying themselves as law enforcement,"" James said in a written statement announcing the letter. ""There is no place in this country for a secret police force operating in the shadows."" WATCH: Nadler, Duffy clash on congestion pricing The attorneys general name checked several proposed bills as potentially meeting their demands, including the ""No Secret Police Act,"" the ""No Anonymity in Immigration Enforcement Act,"" and the ""ICE Badge Visibility Act"" in the House of Representatives. In the Senate, they cited the ""Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement (VISIBLE) Act."" Their call for transparency comes as New York State Senator Patricia Fahy became the prime sponsor of the Senate version of the Mandating End of Lawless Tactics (MELT) Act on Wednesday. That bill would ban ICE agents from wearing masks or plainclothes when operating in New York. New York congressmember defends voting not to release Epstein files That proposed bill makes agents wear clear uniforms with visible name badges and agency-identifying apparel. It would see agencies filing public reports documenting when and why they wore masks, use-of-force incidents, and civil arrests conducted in-state. Consumer alert: New York warns military of rising scams ""When agents of the federal government are operating like masked militias, we've crossed a dangerous line by turning immigration enforcement into a paramilitary secret police force that should shock the nation's collective conscience,"" Fahy said in a written statement. She said that current ICE tactics go ""beyond immigration enforcement"" and resemble ""authoritarian regimes."" The bill still awaits an official number in the legislature. Even so, if eventually passed and signed by Governor Kathy Hochul, the law could see officers who violate the act facing a misdemeanor charge. Hochul: New York could be targeted by drone attacks The attorneys general said that ICE agents wearing masks and regular clothes make arrests without identifying themselves, all while driving unmarked cars. They said that, to bystanders, this is no different than witnessing a kidnapping. They also argued that it prevents public reports on legitimate bad behavior from those agents, eroding short- and long-term trust. The letter identified current federal laws that already require immigration officers to self-identify ""as soon as it is practical and safe to do so"" during an arrest. The letter writers said that they think ICE's current procedures violate those laws, so Congress should clarify those requirements to prevent further problems. Although exceptions or protections for agents could be necessary in rare circumstances, the AGs insisted that wearing masks and anonymity shouldn't be normal. New York updates high school graduation requirements The AGs outlined safety risks for people being arrested, ICE agents, and members of the public who try to step in to save a victim from being abducted. And they underlined the issue of people taking advantage of ICE's secretive nature to impersonate them. The letter from the attorneys general cited former ICE official Scott Shuchart's concern that the feds might be ""setting ourselves up for a kind of vigilante problem where people either don't know, or at least aren't sure, that these officers who are dressed up like bank robbers are actually law enforcement officers."" Hochul warns of 'draconian cuts' to New York's bottom line with OBBBA Acting Director Todd Lyons has defended the use of masks by citing concerns about harassment against agents and their families, according to a June 2, 2025, Associated Press report by Leah Willingham. Hochul unveils tariff guide for concerned businesses The attorneys general acknowledged concerns about harassment against doxed agents and their families, but said they can resolve those concerns in the limited number of cases that are legitimate. They also said that those concerns should not outweigh risks to public safety and civil liberties. If federal authorities are confident their practices are legal and fair, they should not be afraid to identify themselves. That's according to James and the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and the District of Columbia. DOH reports on health gaps for LGBTQIA+ New Yorkers The push follows a significant increase in funding for ICE included in OBBBA. The Big Beautiful Bill gave the agency a $75 billion funding increase. Adding another layer, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman signed an executive order on Friday permitting local law enforcement—including those deputized to assist in ICE raids—to conceal their identities during approved operations such as immigration enforcement. ""All federal, state and local law enforcement officers, in the furtherance of carrying out specific operations, pursuant to the policies and procedures of such agency or department and with the approval of their supervisor(s), shall be permitted to wear masks and/or other facial coverings when deemed necessary to protect their personal safety, the personal safety of their families, or the integrity of the operation,"" the new order reads. Mask off: New York bill would charge ICE agents who hide their faces Blakeman previously signed an executive order banning people from wearing masks while committing a crime—which critics characterize as a way to criminalize protest. ""Wearing a mask, if you're not law enforcement, impedes law enforcement from doing their duties and responsibilities because people will cover themselves,"" he said, identifying the distinction between the ban and the updated exception to the ban in his new order. ""Unless it's for a religious reason or a health reason, they're covering themselves so they can get away with a crime, in most cases.""

The investigation of a brutal death sends Turner on a collision course with the dark secrets within the park, and in his own past. Review: Taylor Sheridan's Yellowstone franchise has cornered the market on contemporary Western series. However, with the expansion into cop shows with Y: Marshals, the floodgates have opened for every streaming service and studio to try their hands at developing similar projects. While many of these shows will be derivative or formulaic, it takes an exceptional talent to try and deliver something that clicks with audiences like Sheridan's flagship series did. Mark L. Smith and Elle Smith deliver Untamed, a solid drama set in the vast beauty of Yosemite National Park that works well thanks to being a limited series with a solid narrative arc and a stellar leading performance from Eric Bana. While Untamed may be a bit bland in some areas, it is a perfect summer binge option if you want something with just a little substance but not too much. Untamed, comprised of six episodes, opens with rock climbers scaling the famed El Capitan when a woman's body plummets from the top. As the park rangers begin their investigation, the case is taken over by Investigative Services Branch (ISB). Arriving on horseback like an old school cowboy, ISB Special Agent Kyle Turner (Eric Bana) is a tough guy of few words who does not get along well with the park rangers, except Chief Paul Souter (Sam Neill), who accepts Turner's brusque persona. Seeing something more profound in the conflicting evidence that may lead to a case of a human killer rather than a suspected animal attack, Turner is teamed with new park ranger and veteran police officer Naya Vasquez (Lily Santiago) to work the case. Right from the start, Untamed sets up the expected elements of every police procedural. The veteran cop who doesn't work with partners is teamed with an idealistic rookie to solve the case. The powers that be don't want feathers ruffled as evidence mounts of a sinister conspiracy underneath. Untamed uses all of the plot points we have seen repeatedly, but it is set apart thanks to Yosemite and Eric Bana. The filming occurred in Vancouver rather than Yosemite, but the natural locations enhance the story. As Turner says in the first episode, the park is the size of Rhode Island, with a hundred thousand visitors weekly, giving the search area the scale of a major city but with the dangers of nature added on. What Yellowstone did for Montana is what Untamed aims to do for Yosemite. The park serves as a character with the space ripe for future seasons should Untamed be a hit with viewers and earn a second volume. The other key factor is Eric Bana himself. Bana has proven himself to be a talented, woefully underused actor who has been stellar in recent films like A Sacrifice. Bana has also shown his skill at playing an investigator in The Dry and its sequel, Force of Nature, but Kyle Turner is a different role. Turner's backstory is explored through each episode of Untamed, giving us more insight into his loneliness and where his skills as a detective come from. As we learn what led to his arrival in Yosemite, the series gets an added boost that heightens the intensity of the case he is investigating. Bana is a great leading man, and playing Turner allows him to dig into a character over a longer time than you typically get in a feature film. His drinking problem adds a weakness for Turner that Bana never turns into a crutch or a cliche. Overall, this may be one of Bana's best performances. With solid supporting turns from Sam Neill, Lily Santiago, and Rosemarie DeWitt as Turner's ex-wife, with whom he still shares a strong friendship, Untamed does at times get stuck in the same rut that most procedurals do by revisiting red herrings and dealing with the slog of interviews with suspects and protracted chases. Luckily, the limited episodes keep the story moving, and the momentum rarely slips for long. Created by Mark L. Smith (The Revevant, Twisters) and Elle Smith, Untamed is an interesting use of the procedural in a unique setting. Smith already delivered the outstanding American Primeval for Netflix earlier this year, and, while not quite on the same level as that series, Untamed is a contemporary companion that follows the same Western structure. The Smiths wrote all six Untamed episodes directed by Thomas Bezucha, Nick Murphy, and Neasa Hardiman. Untamed, anchored by Eric Bana's excellent performance and the natural beauty of Yosemite National Park, is an engaging mystery that delivers a concrete resolution even though it may not live up to the intensity of the investigation. I had hoped for a flashier ending to this mystery, but at least the journey was enjoyable. Some depth to this story makes it worth watching and commands more attention than Law & Order or other network-caliber cop series. Untamed works well because of the constraints of only having six hours' worth of storytelling, which keeps the filler and misdirecting to a minimum. I would love to see Eric Bana reprise this character in additional seasons as long as The Smiths stay in charge and keep the story in Yosemite. Untamed is worth checking out. Untamed premieres on July 17th on Netflix. Source: JoBlo.com"

mov_D8CED81FA3C452F833E179BEE5000D10,2025-07-17 13:30:32,en,WEB,"  In September, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson stole the spotlight from the coming U.S. Supreme Court term with her whirlwind schedule of appearances to promote her memoir, . There were serious TV and print interviews about the book, which details her upbringing as the daughter of parents who faced segregation and her auspicious path to the legal profession and the nation's highest court. There were also somewhat lighter interviews with Elle magazine, the ladies of , and . Colbert, for his part, showed Jackson a page from her 1988 high school yearbook in which Jackson professed her desire “to go into law and eventually have a judicial appointment.” He suggested that her phrasing, as opposed to just saying “be a judge,” was “taking it seriously at a young age.” To laughter from the studio audience, Jackson said, “I was already choosing my words carefully.” By the end of the 2024-25 court term, Jackson's carefully chosen words from her day job, mostly in dissent, are what had people talking. “What struck me the most was Justice Jackson kind of popping out of her shell,” U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the Rhode Island Democrat, Judiciary Committee member and frequent critic of the conservative-dominated court told Slate's Dahlia Lithwick on her Amicus podcast this week. Jackson has “pulled back the curtain” and started to call out the conservative majority's “patterns and predispositions,” Whitehouse said. Jessica Clarke, a professor at the University of Southern California Gould School of Law, says that with her dissents, Jackson “is trying to explain to an audience beyond her colleagues what's happening right now, and she's asking that we all pay attention.” Clarke particularly liked a line in Jackson's dissent in an April decision in , in which the majority granted President Donald Trump's administration's emergency-docket request to cancel more than 100 teacher-preparation grants to higher education institutions, school districts and nonprofits. Jackson criticized the majority for focusing on the “ancillary threshold and remedial questions” raised by the administration. “Children, pets, and magicians might find pleasure in the clever use of such shiny-object tactics,” Jackson wrote. “But a court of law should not be so easily distracted.” Clarke says the “shiny objects” line “nicely sums up a theme of the term: that the court has refused to acknowledge the real stakes of its decisions. It has instead diverted attention by focusing on procedure, engaging in circular logic, contorting the texts of statutes … and inventing histories and traditions.” Strong language in dissent and a colleague's rebuke Jackson, 54 and in her third term on the court, wrote just five majority opinions, but at least 20 concurring and dissenting opinions, including in matters from the court's emergency docket that were still being decided as of this week. Several of her dissents were in response to rulings favoring the Trump administration. On May 30, when the court in an emergency order allowed the Trump administration to revoke a form of administrative parole to some 500,000 noncitizens from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela, Jackson wrote in dissent that the majority had “plainly botched” the application of the proper factors for granting such emergency relief. The court “undervalues the devastating consequences of allowing the government to precipitously upend the lives and livelihoods of nearly half a million noncitizens while their legal claims are pending,” Jackson wrote in . In June, the court ruled 7-2 that fuel producers had standing to sue the Environmental Protection Agency over its approval of California's regulations that require automakers to manufacture more electric vehicles and fewer gasoline-powered ones with a goal of decreasing emissions from liquid fuels. In a dissent in , Jackson said, “This case gives fodder to the unfortunate perception that moneyed interests enjoy an easier road to relief in this court than ordinary citizens.” The Jackson dissent that got the most attention came June 27, the last formal day of the term. In , the court ruled universal injunctions issued by federal district judges blocking a federal policy against nonparties nationwide likely exceeded the equitable authority granted by Congress to the courts. The court partially stayed the injunctions that had blocked Trump's executive order aiming to end birthright citizenship for children born in the United States to immigrant parents who had entered or were living in the country illegally. Jackson said the majority was endangering the rule of law and practically endorsing “the creation of a zone of lawlessness within which the executive has the prerogative to take or leave the law as it wishes.” She went on to say the majority's ruling was “profoundly dangerous, since it gives the executive the go-ahead to sometimes wield the kind of unchecked, arbitrary power the founders crafted our Constitution to eradicate.” Jackson's solo dissent, which was separate from the principal dissent by Justice Sonia Sotomayor and joined by Justice Elena Kagan as well as Jackson, prompted an unusual rebuke from Justice Amy Coney Barrett in the majority opinion. Jackson “chooses a startling line of attack” that “offers a vision the judicial role that would make even the most ardent defender of judicial supremacy blush,” Barrett wrote. “We will not dwell on Justice Jackson's argument, which is at odds with more than two centuries' worth of precedent, not to mention the Constitution itself,” Barrett said. “We observe only this: Justice Jackson decries an imperial executive while embracing an imperial judiciary.” The tiff sparked widespread commentary. It was an “unprecedented swipe” by Barrett, New York University law professor Melissa Murray said on the Strict Scrutiny podcast. At a term review at the University of California at Irvine law school last week, Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of Berkeley Law and an ABA Journal contributor, said Barrett's response to Jackson “crossed a line.” “I think that there's been an increase in sarcasm and put-downs among the justices, and it's lamentable whether it's the conservatives or liberals doing it, but I think that Justice Barrett treating Justice Jackson that way was regrettable,” he said. Some conservatives took delight in Barrett's rebuke. But others suggested the real issue was overheated rhetoric by Jackson in her dissents and her aggressive questioning during oral arguments. Josh Blackman, a professor at South Texas College of Law Houston who sometimes attends arguments, says he has observed liberal Justice Kagan appearing “kind of annoyed” at some of Jackson's questions. “It's like, 'What are you doing?'” the conservative Blackman suggested Kagan was thinking. “'We need to recruit conservatives to join us. Why are you going on these sort of tangents?'” “I think we're seeing a schism” among the liberal justices, with Sotomayor and Kagan sometimes not joining Jackson's more strident dissents, Blackman said at a Heritage Foundation term review this month. Clarke, the USC law professor, says she doesn't “have a lot of patience for these objections to Justice Jackson in terms of her tone.” “She is raising the alarm about the threat that the Trump administration's lawless actions pose to our democracy and calling attention to the fact that the Supreme Court has hobbled the judicial branch from serving as a check and balance,” Clarke says. “In my view, this is an important message for the public.” No glass jaw for Jackson as she absorbs jabs Now that the term is over (except for the seemingly never-finished emergency docket), Jackson has resumed her book tour and has ha..."

I amended my 2024 return because I accidentally used a 2023 W2, which Rhode Island taxes kindly pointed out to me. This was in March 2025, amended returns are supposed to be proceeded in 16 weeks & I was expecting a refund which I really needed. After 16 weeks, I called the amended return line & the man I spoke to said someone “inexperienced” who works at the IRS incorrectly processed my amended return & it was closed, this is all without any communication to me about it being closed. He assured me he was reopening it & “pushing it through” again & I would have an update in 30 days. I called 30 days later only to be told by the person who answered the phone that my amended return was incorrect & he went on to try to prove it by asking me what federal taxes were withheld & when I told him the amount he said it was incorrect but he didn't take into account that I overpaid $900 in social security which increased my overall federal taxes withheld. He said I had to refile & wait another 16 weeks for it to be processed!! I called again this morning hoping to get someone who knows what they're doing only to have the woman tell me they, the IRS, couldn't verify my W2 info, then she proceeded to spew off some BS about now they have to wait for the social security admin to verify my W2 info (?????) which only happens every quarter. The she switched her story to telling me I have to refile my amended return again & wait another 16 weeks. I'm so frustrated with the different stories I get from each person at the IRS but now I guess I'll refile my amended return with the same damn info again & hope whomever gets it this time has a clue & just processes it.

mov_AAFA5430D8D06CCE0D27D7339CC744BB,2025-07-17 14:24:02,en,WEB,"  The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) is bringing together state lawmakers, corporate lobbyists, MAGA followers, and right-wing operatives and funders at the four-star JW Marriott Indianapolis this week for its annual meeting, where once again it will strategize about how to further suppress the vote, prop up the fossil fuel industry, push Trump's priorities, and more. For over a decade, ALEC — which works with state lawmakers behind closed doors to develop model legislation supporting its far-right agenda — perpetuated the lie that it “doesn't work on voting issues,” even as it maintained a secret elections working group. The Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) exposed its “Honest Elections” academies held in conjunction with ALEC meetings and Leonard Leo's dark money-funded Honest Elections Project (HEP). On June 1, ALEC CEO Lisa Nelson announced  the formation of an elections-focused Process and Procedures Task Force chaired by Rhode Island State Representative Jon Brien (R) and HEP's Executive Director Jason Snead, a longtime ALEC ally. The task force will hold its first meeting this week to consider a number of model bills designed to make it harder to vote and undermine public confidence in the integrity of our elections. . ALEC's Veterans and Military Affairs Task Force, launched in January, will also hold its first in-person meeting this week. Iowa Speaker Pro Tempore John Wills (R) serves as the public sector chair of the task force, which is also led by Mike Hutchings, CEO of Combined Arms, who serves as its private sector chair. Once again the “nonpartisan” ALEC is teaming up with Run Gen Z to hold an “informational meeting” in Indianapolis. The bill mill's advocacy arm, ALEC Action , has joined forces with the Iowa-based nonprofit to recruit and train young “conservatives” to run for state and local office. As a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) charitable organization, ALEC is prohibited by law from engaging in any electoral activity, including through ALEC Action, over which it exerts full control. Earlier this year ALEC staff, including Nelson, attended a Run Gen Z event called “100 Days in the Golden Age,” where they “had the opportunity to attend a policy briefing inside the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, led by President Trump's policy team,” according to an email (LINK to email) from the manager of ALEC's Center to Protect Free Speech. Speakers at this week's meeting include former World Wrestling Entertainment CEO and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon, anti-ESG and DEI zealots Will Hild and Vivek Ramaswamy , Indiana Governor Mike Braun (R), and Heritage Foundation President Kevin Roberts, chief architect of the Project 2025 blueprint for Trump's second act. Roberts gained notoriety last year when speaking in defense of Heritage's controversial blueprint on Steve Bannon's War Room  podcast , where he claimed the country is in the midst of a “second American Revolution” that will be bloodless “if the left allows it to be.” Voter Suppression and Election Disinformation At this week's ALEC meeting, attendees are considering a number of model bills dealing with elections. The group is once again asking its members to approve a voter ID bill, the Valid Voter Identification Act , despite being forced to disband its elections task force in 2012 due to public backlash against a similar bill and its “Stand Your Ground” model legislation. Voter ID laws disenfranchise millions of Americans. “As many as 11 percent of eligible voters do not have the kind of ID that is required by states with strict ID requirements, and that percentage is even higher among seniors, minorities, people with disabilities, low-income voters, and students,” the nonpartisan Brennan Center has found . This new iteration of ALEC's voter ID model legislation not only calls for an ID requirement, it requires every driver's license and state ID issued to noncitizens to “display the word 'NONCITIZEN' on the front,”potentially assisting Trump's efforts to round up and deport the undocumented. Nineteen states and the District of Columbia allow undocumented immigrants to obtain a driver's license. While these licenses are not emblazoned with the word “noncitizen,” they use other terms to clearly indicate that they cannot be used as an official ID to register to vote or as REAL ID for travel. ALEC has been working with the little-known, dark-money group Americans for Citizens Voting (ACV) since last summer to move a model state constitutional amendment and a model bill to ban noncitizens from voting, perpetuating the lie that noncitizen voting is common and capable of threatening the outcome of elections. “Every legitimate study ever done on the question shows that voting by noncitizens in state and federal elections is vanishingly rare,” the Brennan Center reported . ALEC is also offering a workshop on “Safeguarding Elections Against Foreign Interference and Noncitizen Voting” led by Snead, HEP Vice President Chad Ennis, and Americans for Public Trust Executive Director Caitlin Sutherland. In addition, ALEC politicians will debate and vote on the Mail Voting Deadlines Act , which would require that only mail-in ballots received by the closing of polls on Election Day be counted. This would disenfranchise anyone whose ballot is delayed by the U.S. Postal Service. Participants in this week's ALEC meeting will also consider model bills designed to fan the flames of the Big Lie of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. The Protecting Election Administration from Private Funding and Influence Act would ban “funds or in-kind goods or services for election administration if those funds or in-kind goods or services are donated directly or indirectly by any person other than a government entity.” This model legislation is likely a response to the unsubstantiated claim among MAGA election deniers that the grants provided by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan to local election offices around the country cost Trump the 2020 election. Even the Koch-backed Cato Institute debunked the theory years ago, but that hasn't stopped ALEC election deniers from still pushing for this legislation more than five years later. The Election Crime Prosecution Act model policy ALEC circulated this week would require state attorneys general to appoint an independent prosecutor to investigate and prosecute voter fraud. The Brennan Center has found that voter fraud is “very rare, voter impersonation is virtually nonexistent, and many instances of alleged fraud are, in fact, mistakes by voters or administrators.” Aiding Trump ALEC meeting attendees are debating a few other model policies that support Trump's anti-immigrant agenda and fuel xenophobia. The Resolution to Include Citizenship on United States Census , for example, calls on Congress to add a citizenship question on the next census in 2030. Trump had attempted to add this question on the 2020 census but was blocked by the Supreme Court. In 2018, a test run of the census that included a question about citizenship suggested that many noncitizens would simply avoid participating in the census altogether if they were asked that question. The Act to Strengthen Existing State Human Trafficking Statutes would make it a felony for anyone who “Intentionally conceals, harbors, or shields from detection, or intentionally encourages or induces another to conceal, harbor, or shield from detection, an individual that the person knows has illegally entered or remained in the United States, as determined by the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement of the United States Department of ..."

mov_EEC81EF4D348A67B6D9DAC90767C187A,2025-07-17 14:55:00,en,WEB,"  In Netflix's “Untamed,” Eric Bana plays a rugged, no-nonsense special agent for the National Parks Service working the mystery of a woman's death in Yosemite. The six-episode series isn't doing anything new, which tends to get a bad rap these days. The streaming era has prioritized breaking from, or at least playing around with, TV norms, but these kinds of meat-and-potatoes offerings can be as satisfying as shows with wilder ambitions. That said, “Untamed” suffers from some object permanence issues; nothing about it stayed with me after watching it. But while it was on in front of me? A good (enough) time. A lot of that has to do with executive producer John Wells, whose vast array of credits include everything from “ER” to “The West Wing” to “The Pitt.” He doesn't have a recognizable style like fellow super-producers Shonda Rhimes or Ryan Murphy, but he understands television in ways that have become increasingly rare. Here he's working with show creators Elle Smith and Mark L. Smith (the latter of whom was the screenwriter of 2024's “Twisters”). The series opens with two climbers ascending the vertical rock face known as El Capitan. Suddenly, a woman's lifeless body comes hurtling past them from above, getting caught in their ropes and nearly taking them down with her. The circumstances of her death become the show's driving plotline. When Bana's Kyle Turner arrives at the summit on horseback, a park ranger says with a mixture of envy and annoyance: “Here comes Gary Cooper.” Turner is haunted by past mistakes, a broken marriage, a dead son and a tendency to find solace at the bottom of a bottle. “What's with you tonight?” someone says. “You're extra serious even for you.” That sums up his personality. The ranger assigned to assist his investigation is a rookie and that's because Turner has burned through everyone else with his stubborn insistence on doing things his own way. When an Indigenous character shows up, it's because Turner (and Turner alone) has befriended him. These are common tropes that can be tedious in the wrong hands — the dead child has become overused as a shorthand meant to add sympathetic texture to a character's backstory — but “Untamed” is made with enough talent and skill that these pieces feel right, instead of hacky. Credit that to Bana's performance, which doesn't belabor the guy's issues nor his stoicism. The Gary Cooper thing isn't too far off. Lily Santiago plays Naya Vasquez, the inexperienced park ranger with whom he's paired. She's from the city and therefore not thrilled with the idea of jumping on the back of a horse to explore the area for clues, but Turner won't budge. “This park's the size of Rhode Island. It's got five separate highway entrances bringing over 100,000 people a week,” and going off the trails, on horseback, is better than going in his truck. That she will eventually come around to him, and he to her, is a foregone conclusion. Sam Neill and Rosemarie DeWitt round out the cast as the seasoned head park ranger who looks out for Turner and Turner's amiable ex-wife, respectively. The series' premise is better suited to a movie, but at six episodes it doesn't overstay its welcome. The wide open spaces and the occasional appearance of (CGI?) wildlife are as picturesque as you'd expect — it's one of the show's selling points — although filming took place not in California-based Yosemite but in British Columbia. I suppose one soaring, mountainous forest looks like another. The park rangers are stuck wearing unflattering uniforms, but Turner has too much swagger for that and is outfitted in jeans and a sand-colored work shirt worn with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows. The show's subtitle might as well be “Untamed: Eric Bana's Forearms.” Where other shows try to leverage the sex appeal of their male lead by having him doff his shirt within the first 20 minutes, “Untamed” takes a different tack, and I like it. Hollywood has never really understood the appeal of a good pair of forearms. Now's as good a time as any. ——— 'UNTAMED' 2.5 stars (out of 4) Rating: TV-MA How to watch: Netflix ———"

Larry Ellison hiện sở hữu hơn 40% cổ phần của Oracle. Ảnh: Startup Talky Tính đến ngày 15-7, ông Ellison sở hữu khối tài sản ròng trị giá 251,2 tỉ USD, chỉ đứng sau tỉ phú Elon Musk - người giàu nhất thế giới với khối tài sản 358 tỉ USD. Trong khi đó, Zuckerberg đứng thứ 3 với 251 tỉ USD. Nhà sáng lập Amazon, Jeff Bezos xếp thứ 4 (247 tỉ USD) và cựu CEO Microsoft Steve Ballmer xếp thứ 5 (174 tỉ USD). Theo Bloomberg, Ellison trở thành tỉ phú từ năm 1993 và 80% tài sản của ông đến từ cổ phiếu và quyền chọn cổ phiếu Oracle. Giá cổ phiếu Oracle đã tăng 5,7% hôm 15-7 sau khi Chính phủ Mỹ nới lỏng một số hạn chế dưới thời cựu Tổng thống Joe Biden, cho phép các nhà sản xuất chip như Nvidia và Advanced Mico Devices xuất khẩu một số chất bán dẫn sang Trung Quốc. Tháng trước, tài sản ròng của vị tỉ phú 80 tuổi đã tăng thêm 26 tỉ USD nhờ giá cổ phiếu Oracle tăng mạnh. Ngoài lĩnh vực công nghệ, ông Ellison đã chi hàng trăm triệu USD vào bất động sản hạng sang trong thập kỷ qua, bao gồm các bất động sản ở California; biệt thự Beechwood ở Rhode Island và 1 khu đất ở Vùng Vịnh San Francisco. Nhà sáng lập Oracle còn sở hữu khoảng 1,5% cổ phần Tesla, theo báo cáo năm 2022 của hãng sản xuất ô tô này. Tuy vậy, Ellison đã rời khỏi hội đồng quản trị Tesla vào tháng 6-2022 và cổ phần của ông chưa được tiết lộ trong các báo cáo tiếp theo. Ông cũng là một trong những nhà đầu tư bên ngoài lớn nhất cho nỗ lực mua lại Twitter của tỉ phú Musk.

mov_7B1E05CD9AC5439BA35349B0BC36E982,2025-07-17 15:30:00,en,WEB,"  Early in their investigation into the death of an unidentified woman, ISB officer Kyle Turner (Eric Bana) and park ranger Naya Vasquez (Lily Santiago) discover a few clues in an eerie abandoned shed. There's a bloody rope laying on the floor, a footprint on the door, and fresh carvings in the rickety wooden walls. Kyle bags the evidence, photographs the etchings, and the two exchange theories about what may have happened here. Then, as Naya heads back outside, a bear slams into the door. Naya falls down as the bear bangs on the thin wood separating it from its prey, roaring in sudden, vicious fury. She scrambles for her sidearm, but Kyle already has gun out. He fires two shots into the air, and the bear runs off. Not long after that random disturbance, Kyle reminds his rookie colleague that her new gig isn't like any work she did in the big city. This is Yosemite National Park. It's the size of Rhode Island, all of which is their jurisdiction and 95 percent of which is designated wilderness. “This is not L.A.,” Kyle says. “Things happen different out here.” That may be true, given how few bears go knocking door-to-door in Beverly Hills, but there isn't enough proof in “Untamed.” Netflix's new crime drama from creators Mark L. Smith (“American Primeval”) and Elle Smith drifts further and further away from its distinctive setting and circumstances across its six-episode story, just as it leans harder and harder on murder-mystery tropes that have all but exhausted their utility. By the end, “Untamed” can only offer more of the same, despite ample opportunity to provide something “different.” Take our lead, Kyle (please). At first, he's a familiar detective type but one sporting enough signature characteristics to feel like his own person. He works for the Investigative Services Branch of the National Parks — a real department! — and his elevated status there allows him enough leeway to play the lone wolf. He can ride horseback (instead of driving a car), he can stew quietly (instead of brainstorming with a partner), and he can dictate his own hours (instead of punching a clock, like a chump). Whatever job security he has (which isn't much, given how often the suits yell at him) stems from his expertise in the lost art of tracking. And you know Kyle's a good tracker because of how often he pauses mid-stroll, stoops to the ground, and examines a suspicious marking. But before the first episode is up, the balance between Kyle the archetype and Kyle the individual starts to fall apart. His buddy and pseudo-boss, Paul Souter (Sam Neill), smells bourbon on Kyle's breath — during his shift — which means, yes, our antihero has a drinking problem. Then he makes Naya, his young Hispanic colleague, pass a series of personal tests before he lends her the respect anyone should extend to a nice coworker who's only trying to help. And, of course, he spends his nights drunk-dialing his ex-wife, Jill (Rosemarie Dewitt), who's just trying to get a decent night's sleep next to her nice new hubby. Rosemarie DeWitt and Eric Bana in 'Untamed'Courtesy of Netflix Kyle's after-hours phone calls aren't rooted in anything as simple as lingering feelings for his lost love. They stem from a fact “Untamed” treats like a twist, but when the turn arrives at the end of Episode 1, it induces groans over gasps. Worse still, his “surprise” backstory knocks Kyle off his horse, so to speak — saddling him with too many tropes for one man to balance. Bana embodies Kyle's suffocating cliches with endearing commitment, his gravelly voice, gentle countenance, and steadfast capability combining to form a recognizable portrait of pride and suffering. But there's too little time for Bana's performance to deepen or subvert his defining traits, especially as the central case piles on its own stale patterns. In the series' sole thrilling sequence, a pair of mountain climbers are sent spinning when a body falls from the cliff's edge above them and gets tangled in their ropes. As an opening scene, it's dizzying and disturbing (nor does it treat the nameless mountaineers as expendable dumb-dumbs). But it also cuts away at the peak of their predicament — with one climber dangling beneath the other, hundreds of feet in the air, a corpse caught in between them — in order to shift the focus to more mundane circumstances, aka the investigation we're meant to care about more than anything save for the characters doing the investigating. More in Entertainment A dead girl. A depressed cop with daddy issues. Can our hero solve the mystery of her death and maybe, just maybe, save his own life in the process? “Untamed” dares to ask the same questions as “Mare of Easttown,” “Happy Valley,” “True Detective,” and dozens of other cop dramas just like them, only not as clearly or convincingly. (Kyle's sheen of integrity gets pretty cloudy after the final twist.) It also a stretches a movie premise to the length of a miniseries, but what's more frustrating is that “Untamed” doesn't add anything distinguishing to the mix, despite an enticing ingredient sitting right there, largely ignored, in the massive form of Yosemite itself. “Untamed” could've been a serviceable genre exercise, allowing the audience to play cowboy in the great outdoors while enjoying the sturdy structure of a modern crime show. But as Kyle and Naya get closer to the truth, they get further away from their natural reality. There's no tactile joy to dress up the rudimentary chase — no random rainstorms ripping through camp, no snowy mountaintops on summer days, no campfires, no canoe trips, no sense of the wild. On the rare occasion when the series tries to incorporate the perils of the park, the staging is unconvincing and the results are predictable. The bear never returns, and neither does the difference it made. Grade: C- “Untamed” premieres Thursday, July 17 on Netflix. All six episodes will be released at once."

As Washington's letter was read aloud from the pulpit of what is now America's oldest standing synagogue, Touro Synagogue in Newport, R.I., Jews were barred from holding public office in many states. Colonial-era religious test oaths demanded the affirmation “upon my faith as a Christian,” which effectively excluded Jews, Quakers, and others from equal participation in civic life. Maryland enforced such an oath longer than most. It wasn't until 1827 that Jews were granted equal political rights in that state. Thomas Kennedy, a Protestant legislator, had never met a Jew. yet was repulsed by the blatant discrimination that violated the spirit of the American experiment. He fought for eight years against rabid antisemitism to pass his “Jew Bill” that lifted the restrictions on Jews. Incredibly, it took until 1903 for Maryland to remove restrictions on Quakers. American Jews have rarely asked for privilege or special status. Like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. did generations later, American Jews have asked to be judged not by background or belief but by the content of their character. The American experiment has always been marked by contradiction. Mt. Rushmore itself is a monument to that tension. Carved into the Black Hills of South Dakota — sacred land to the Lakota Sioux — it has long symbolized both national pride and historical pain. And yet nearby stands the Crazy Horse Memorial, also carved from sacred land, commissioned by Native leaders to assert: “The red man has great heroes, too.” Gutzon Borglum, the sculptor of Mt. Rushmore, was a known antisemite. Yet the four presidents he carved — Washington, Jefferson, Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt — represent pivotal chapters in the country's unfolding story. They were not selected for their personal virtues or flaws, but for the ways they helped propel the nation toward a more perfect union, even through its contradictions. Jefferson spoke eloquently of liberty while holding hundreds of people in bondage. While some say he wrestled with the immorality of slavery, he never freed his own slaves, nor risked his political capital to end the institution. Lincoln, shaped by the cultural prejudices of his time, initially tolerated bias. But when Civil War General (and later President) Ulysses S. Grant issued his notorious General Order No. 11 expelling “Jews as a class” from his military district of operation, Lincoln acted immediately. He swiftly revoked Grant's order, affirming his belief in judging individuals on their own merit. “I don't like to see a class or nationality condemned on account of a few sinners.” Theodore Roosevelt associated with vicious, antisemitic American influencers, such as Harvard Professor Henry Adams. On the other hand, he courageously stood up to blatant discrimination and Jew hatred, even supporting Zionism. In 1862, in Leavenworth, Kansas, Jewish settlers established Temple B'nai Jeshurun, the first permanent synagogue west of the Mississippi. When the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation placed a marker there 150 years later, it was not just to honor Jewish presence. It was to recognize a milestone in the long American journey toward religious freedom and civic inclusion. At the dedication, Society President Jerry Klinger remarked, “Freedom is a process. The Constitution was not a fully realized ideal when it was ratified. But the genius of the American system is its capacity to correct itself, to right the ship when it leans off course and continue the journey forward.” That same spirit guided the Society's decision to support Mt. Rushmore. When the opportunity arose, JASHP became the first Jewish organization to have the word 'Jewish' engraved on the donor walls of the Grand View Terrace, facing the four presidential carvings. Klinger explained, “We did so not to sanctify the past, but to remind America of what it must still strive to become.” Today, antisemitism has crept back into public discourse under new disguises. If that hatred had succeeded early on — if America had turned its back on Jews seeking refuge — how much would America have lost? The Jewish people never asked for favoritism. They asked to contribute. And because America — however imperfectly — let them in, they did. If America's doors had been closed to Jews there would have been no Haim Salomon, who helped finance the American Revolution; no Nathan Straus, whose mission to pasteurize milk saved thousands of children; no Jonas Salk to eradicate polio; no Albert Einstein, who found refuge in America while fleeing the Nazis, then revolutionized physics and warned Roosevelt of Hitler's atomic threat; no Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who became a voice for justice and constitutional principle; no Hedy Lamarr, whose inventions paved the way for Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS. The Fourth of July has passed. But the promise of Aug. 18, 1790 — that none shall make us afraid, remains."

(Johnny Andrews/UNC-Chapel Hill) “The Summer I Turned Pretty,” an Amazon original series, recently premiered its third season, which features many scenes filmed in Chapel Hill and on UNC's campus. The series, which first premiered in 2022, is centered around a love triangle between a young woman and two brothers. The first two seasons focused on the characters' time in high school. The third season, which had a two-episode premiere on July 16, begins as they enter college. In July of 2024, principal photography took place on UNC's campus, transforming key locations into parts of the fictional “Finch College” in Rhode Island. Showrunners even put out a call to UNC students and faculty, inviting them to apply to be extras. Attentive viewers can catch sights from across UNC-Chapel Hill campus. While the season opens with an establishing drone shot of somewhere that clearly isn't Chapel Hill, it immediately cuts to more familiar locales. Columbia Avenue, Swain Hall, and Old East dorm are all visible within the first minutes of the season's opening episode. “The Summer I Turned Pretty” is the story of Belly, who is pulled back and forth between brothers Conrad and Jeremiah. The latest season features a time jump, cutting from the end of Belly's time in high school to the start of her junior year of college. She's now in a relationship with one of the brothers, but secrets and past decisions immediately spark drama between the two. The season's description promises the other brother will reenter the picture, reigniting the show's central love triangle. The first two episodes of the show are available to view now with an Amazon Prime subscription. The next episode will be released on July 23.

mov_03F27B3A6486AB612F2D45581C145096,2025-07-17 19:13:23,en,WEB,"  The president's vilification of political opponents and journalists seeds the ground for threats of prosecution, imprisonment and deportation unlike any modern president has made. When the Pentagon decided not to send anyone to this week's Aspen Security Forum, an annual bipartisan gathering of national security professionals in the Colorado mountains, President Trump's appointees explained that they would not participate in discussions with people who subscribe to the ""evil of globalism."" After all the evils that the U.S. military has fought, this may be the first time in its history that it has put globalization on its enemies list. But it is simply following the example of Mr. Trump. Last week, he denounced a reporter as a ""very evil person"" for asking a question he did not like. This week, he declared that Democrats are ""an evil group of people."" ""Evil"" is a word getting a lot of airtime in the second Trump term. It is not enough anymore to dislike a journalistic inquiry or disagree with an opposing philosophy. Anyone viewed as critical of the president or insufficiently deferential is wicked. The Trump administration's efforts to achieve its policy goals are not just an exercise in governance but a holy mission against forces of darkness. The characterization seeds the ground to justify all sorts of actions that would normally be considered extreme or out of bounds. If Mr. Trump's adversaries are not just rivals but villains, then he can rationalize going further than any president has in modern times. Last month, he told a cabinet secretary to consider throwing her Biden administration predecessor in prison because of his immigration policy. Last weekend, Mr. Trump said he might strip Rosie O'Donnell's citizenship for the crime of criticizing him. Demonization, of course, has been at the core of Mr. Trump's politics since he took the national stage in 2015 to announce his first successful presidential campaign and disparaged many immigrants crossing the border without permission as ""rapists"" and vowed to block all Muslims from entering the country. His rallies during that campaign rang with ""lock her up"" chants aimed at his opponent, Hillary Clinton. But in returning to power, Mr. Trump has been more focused on rooting out the ""enemy from within,"" as he put it during last year's campaign. He has devoted enormous energy in his second term to prosecuting perceived enemies, purging career officials deemed disloyal and destroying what he calls ""the deep state"" that he believes thwarted his policies last time and then persecuted him through criminal prosecutions after he left office. During the first six months of his first term in 2017, according to a search of the Factbase compendium of his speeches, Mr. Trump regularly used the word ""evil"" to describe terrorists, Nazis and bigots, much as other presidents might have, as well as immigrants. He used it in a domestic political context only once, when complaining about news coverage. In the nearly six months of his second term, he has used it 11 times to describe Democrats or journalists. Mr. Trump has said that former President Joseph R. Biden Jr. was ""an evil guy who wasn't very smart"" and ran a ""very evil regime"" surrounded by advisers and prosecutors who were also ""so bad and so evil, so corrupt."" ""I knew that running was very dangerous, because I knew how evil these people were,"" Mr. Trump said of Democrats on May 12, during an interview on Air Force One with Sean Hannity of Fox News. ""I knew how they cheat, they steal, they lie. They're a horrible group of people."" Speaking with visiting foreign ministers in the Oval Office on June 27, he said: ""We had a president that was incompetent. We had bad people circulating around this desk, this beautiful Resolute Desk. They had, I guess, evil intentions. They would - you couldn't be that stupid. I mean, they had evil intentions."" This is a level of presidential discourse unusual in modern times. President George H.W. Bush once apologized for describing his challengers as ""bozos"" because it was seen as beneath the dignity of the office. His son, President George W. Bush, famously used the word ""evildoers,"" but he was describing terrorists who had hijacked airplanes and slaughtered Americans, not political opponents or reporters. The Trump era has changed the standards, and his critics at times have followed his lead. Robert De Niro has called Mr. Trump an ""evil"" person. During the presidential campaign last year, Jill Biden used the word in criticizing Mr. Trump for disparaging military veterans, which he has denied. ""His own chief of staff said he called P.O.W.s and those who died in war 'losers' and 'suckers,'"" Dr. Biden told an audience in Georgia. ""He's evil."" Discussing Mr. Trump's nomination of his own former lawyer to be a federal judge, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island, said last week that ""the motives are evil ones."" Mr. Trump's allies complain that he has been unfairly targeted by partisan prosecutors, vilified as a fascist, a Nazi and a dictator, and compared to some of history's most horrific villains like Adolf Hitler, Josef Stalin and Benito Mussolini. And they say he is justified in targeting his domestic foes because he believes they targeted him with the prosecutions of recent years. Yet lately, it is Mr. Trump's own base that is seeing evil in the president's circle as some of his allies erupt over the administration's failure to release files that they assume would prove a broader conspiracy surrounding Jeffrey Epstein, the billionaire who died in prison in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. ""Evil forces are trying to take full control of the Trump administration and we must FIGHT to STOP them!!"" Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist, wrote on social media. But a president's words are different than anyone else's. They carry power and set the tone for national debate. More than any recent predecessor, Mr. Trump has encouraged the notion that his presidency is a battle of good versus evil, embracing images of himself as a king, a pope and Superman. Those who question him, then, must be on the other side of that binary equation. When the president visited Texas last week to show concern over deadly floods there, a local CBS News reporter noted that families were upset that warnings had not gone out sooner, which might have saved loved ones who died. ""What do you say to those families?""..."

This number is based on the latest inflation report and is up from . The Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W), the index used to calculate the annual adjustment to Social Security benefits, gained 2.6% in June. Overall inflation rose from . The Federal Reserve's inflation goal is 2%. A cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) is meant to help Americans keep up with  so they can maintain their standard of living from year to year. However, the hikes are falling short, especially when Medicare premiums are rising quickly, seniors say. It and is set to do so again next year. “It's not uncommon for Part B premiums to consume much or even all of the annual COLA, leaving little extra to cover other big cost increases,” Mary Johnson, an independent Social Security and Medicare policy analyst, said. Here's how Ocean State residents could be affected. Medicare Part B costs are rising several times faster than its average rate of increase in recent years. According to the 2025 Medicare Trustees  released in June, the Medicare Part B premium for 2026, is expected to increase to $206.50 from $185.00 in 2025 for a jump of $21.50 per month, or 11.6%. That's the largest Part B increase since 2022 when it rose 14.5%. The Social Security Administration automatically deducts the Part B premium cost from Social Security benefits for most Medicare recipients. A bigger Medicare bite means monthly checks will shrink. “Medicare recipients are quick to point out that Part B premiums can frequently take much or even all of the annual COLA, leaving little extra to cover other big cost increases, such as housing or groceries,” Johnson said. If COLA rises by 2.7%, which is in line with the average 2.6% increase over the past 21 years, and Medicare Part B increases by 11.6%, those with the lowest Social Security benefits would hurt the most. ""If the COLA in 2026 is 2.7%, a Part B premium jump of $21.50 would take the entire COLA of beneficiaries who receive around $800 or less,"" Johnson said. ""This is especially the case for all individuals who receive a low Social Security retirement, spousal, or widow or widower's benefit."" The Social Security Administration bases its COLA each year on average annual increases in the consumer price index for urban wage earners and clerical workers (CPI-W) from July through September. That means July inflation numbers will be especially important to pay attention to. The index for urban wage earners largely reflects the broad index the Labor Department releases each month, although it sometimes differs slightly. Last month, the overall consumer price index rose 2.7% and the index for urban wage earners increased 2.6%. In May, 74.269 million people received Social Security, . These beneficiaries include retired workers, disabled workers, survivors of deceased workers, and those receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI). The average monthly benefit was $1,860.64 in May. SSI checks will be sent out on the following dates remaining in 2025, : In Rhode Island, there are five Social Security offices. Here's where"

Conservator Ingrid Neuman (left) with Rhode Island School of Design undergrad student Sophie Bugat, doing repair work on a statue of Pan. When a new artwork is acquired by a museum, it doesn't go right on display. At least one expert must look it over and make sure it's in good shape. At the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence that expert is often Ingrid Neuman. Kristine Yang writes at the Providence Eye, ""This past November, Ingrid Neuman, senior conservator at the RISD [Rhode Island School of Design] Museum, wheeled a twelfth-century Japanese wooden Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara into Hasbro Children's Hospital for a CAT scan. Conservators have repaired the ancient figure, a revered Buddhist symbol, over centuries — Neuman's examination would reveal exactly where and how they had carried out those repairs. ...     ""Over time, sculptures accumulate dirt and often chip, show wear, or even break. Some arrive with broken parts or past repair attempts that complicate restoration. Preparing these pieces for public exhibition falls to the museum's conservation team. ""Through a meticulous process that integrates chemistry, art history, and craftsmanship, conservators work to stabilize and restore each object. ... Neuman's background in organic chemistry is essential to her work. Sculptures are vulnerable to a host of natural forces over time such as ultraviolet radiation, pollution, humidity, and fluctuations in temperature – all of which can degrade original materials. Pieces with organic materials like wood and ivory, along with metals such as bronze or iron, are particularly prone to these 'agents of deterioration' and can experience accelerated degradation if not properly maintained, says Neuman.      ' An ancient bronze beaker from China wants to corrode. It wants to go back to its original copper ore,' says Neuman. ' We're trying to keep it from doing that.'      "" Corrosion is a natural chemical reaction that occurs when metals like bronze are exposed to oxygen, moisture, or pollutants over time. This reaction, called oxidation, causes the metal to slowly break down. Left unchecked, this chemical process can eat away at the surface of a sculpture. ...     "" 'We borrow a lot of techniques from dentists and doctors,' says Neuman. ' There's a lot of overlap with the medical field.' With limited in-house instrumentation at the RISD Museum, Neuman often relies on nearby hospitals such as Hasbro's and research institutions for specialized evaluations.     "" Understanding a sculpture's composition and preservation history is crucial, as it directly informs the selection of repair materials. ... Conservators intentionally choose repair materials that are visually similar to the original but chemically distinct, ensuring that their work can be easily differentiated from the artist's upon chemical evaluation. “ 'We don't like to use the same materials as the artist,' Neuman says. ' We're not trying to be the artist, or be better than the artist, or confuse people.' ""The ease with which any added materials can be removed is also a crucial consideration for conservators, as they must ensure that any restoration work can be undone without damaging the original piece. ...     ""For this reason, conservators use inpainting – a technique used to fill in missing parts of an artwork – with materials that can be easily distinguished and removed. For example, Neuman says conservators often use acrylic paint when filling in an oil painting. Acrylic is water-based and chemically different from oil paint, allowing it to be safely removed. ...     ""Neuman emphasizes the importance of reversibility and the chemical properties of adhesives. ' There's so many glues in the world. A zillion,' she says. ' Everyone uses epoxy or Gorilla Glue, but we never use them because they're too strong.'     "" If conservators use a glue that is stronger than the sculpture's original material, any physical stress on the object could result in new fractures, rather than breaking along existing lines. ... She prepares her own adhesives in the lab, including wheat starch paste and Funori, a traditional Japanese adhesive made from seaweed — both of which are gentle yet effective enough for conservation work. ""While conservators intentionally make their repairs distinguishable from the original through their selection of materials, their work must remain invisible to the viewer. ... This means conservators must address each deformity with painstaking precision and care. Inpainting demands an especially detailed approach. ... Neuman says, 'You have to use a very tiny brush, with only a few hairs in it, and you have to be really good at color matching.'     "" One of the challenges of inpainting is a color perception phenomenon called metamerism, where colors that match under one light source may look different under another. ... To navigate this, she moves the piece back and forth on wheeled carts between her sunlit lab and the gallery space to ensure the colors match under different lighting conditions. ""Once the restoration is complete, detailed documentation is essential, Neuman says. Photographs of the piece before, during, and after the process, along with written records, are uploaded to the museum's database for future conservators' reference. ' It's important to leave a record,' Neuman says."" More at the Providence Eye, here. This story reminds me of the work that Sotheby's did on one of my mother's Pousette-Dart paintings, one that had been too close to a chimney fire!"

The partnership, unveiled at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh on July 15, represents a strategic response to mounting grid reliability concerns and unprecedented electricity demand growth driven by artificial intelligence and cloud computing expansion. The companies on Tuesday said the joint venture will focus on developing front-of-the-meter generation facilities positioned above the Marcellus and Utica shale formations to provide rapid connections to existing gas pipeline infrastructure while targeting regions with significant data center development interest. PPL will hold a 51% stake in the joint venture, and Blackstone Infrastructure will own 49%. Both parties aim to share expenses and distributions proportionally. PPL noted the partnership will not involve its regulated subsidiaries, including PPL Electric. “We're excited to leverage the powerful expertise that PPL and Blackstone Infrastructure possess to bring much-needed new dispatchable generation online in Pennsylvania to match new data center load in a way that directly supports economic development and large load customer needs, helps to mitigate rising electricity prices for energy consumers, and delivers increased value for shareowners without traditional merchant power risk,” said PPL President and Chief Executive Officer Vincent Sorgi during the announcement hosted by Senator David McCormick at Carnegie Mellon University. Addressing Critical Resource Adequacy Shortfall The partnership emerges as PJM Interconnection faces potential capacity shortages as early as the 2026-27 delivery year, driven by explosive data center demand and the retirement of aging dispatchable generation resources. “Within PPL Electric Utilities' service territory in Pennsylvania alone, data center interest has reached over 60 GW of potential projects, with over 13 GW in advanced stages of planning,” PPL noted on Tuesday. But if all 13 GW materialize, PPL estimates a 6 GW generation shortfall in its territory within five to six years. That represents about a $15 billion investment need, assuming natural gas combined-cycle units are used to meet this need,” it said. While that generation could be built by existing independent producers or the new joint venture, PPL notably said it could also be developed by PPL Electric Utilities—“if permitted.” PPL Corp., notably, is today a fully regulated utility holding company with no competitive generation assets. It completed its strategic exit from competitive generation in 2015, when it spun off PPL Energy Supply to form Talen Energy, and has since focused exclusively on transmission and distribution through its regulated utilities in Pennsylvania, Kentucky, and Rhode Island. On Tuesday, the company suggested the new joint venture with Blackstone offers “a creative solution,”  allowing it to stretch beyond its regulated utility model to grasp the opportunity posed by data centers, address regional reliability, without re-entering the merchant generation space. The company, however, stressed that the joint venture “does not lessen the need for additional action to address underlying resource adequacy concerns.” That will include “passage of current legislation pending before both the Pennsylvania House and Senate to allow the state's utilities to invest in, own and operate generation again,” it noted. The bills now pending before the Pennsylvania House (HB1272) and Senate (SB312) would mark a decisive policy reversal—allowing regulated utilities to once again build, own, and operate power plants, and to enter long-term contracts with independent developers to ensure capacity additions keep pace with surging demand and reliability needs. “The legislation also encourages utilities to enter into long-term contracts with independent power producers to help derisk their new generation investment,” PPL added on Tuesday. “Meeting this unprecedented demand growth will require an unprecedented response and will require all market participants to be part of the solution.” During the inaugural Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit, hosted by Senator Dave McCormick (R-Pennsylvania) at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, notably, companies announced more than $90 billion of investments in data centers, energy, and power infrastructure, and workforce and artificial intelligence projects in a widesscale effort to address resource adequacy as an urgent, system-wide concern. A big push has come from Gov. Josh Shapiro, who, frustrated with PJM's protracted interconnection process, filed a formal complaint late last year that culminated in a settlement in January 2025 reducing PJM's auction price cap, lowering it from more than $500/MW-day to $325/MW-day. At the summit, Shapiro called the moment a “once-in-a-generation opportunity” to align energy policy, private investment, and permitting reform, spotlighting his administration's new Lightning Plan to boost in-state power generation, expedite approvals through the PA Permit Fast Track program, and unlock shovel-ready sites via the $500 million PA SITES initiative. He noted the strategy has already secured $25 billion in private investment—including Amazon's record-setting $20 billion AI and cloud campus buildout—and said Pennsylvania's successful push to reduce PJM's capacity price cap will save consumers an estimated $21 billion over two years. At the summit, notably, PPL also said it would invest $6.8 billion through 2028 to expand grid capacity and modernize transmission across multiple Pennsylvania counties to support the growing power demand of data centers. For Blackstone Infrastructure, meanwhile, the joint venture aligns with a broader strategy to fuse its digital infrastructure investments with long-term, contracted generation assets. Since launching in 2017, the firm has amassed $60 billion in infrastructure assets under management and posted a 17% net annual return. Over the past three years, it has significantly expanded its presence in the data center space, including to take QTS Realty Trust private in a $10 billion deal that added 7 million square feet of hyperscale capacity, and forming a $7 billion joint venture with Digital Realty to develop four hyperscale campuses totaling 500 MW across Northern Virginia, Frankfurt, and Paris. In January 2025, Blackstone Energy Transition Partners announced its acquisition of the 774-MW Potomac Energy Center, a modern combined cycle gas plant located in Loudoun County, Virginia—better known as “Data Center Alley”—in a deal estimated at $1 billion. At the summit in Pennsylvania, Blackstone committed over $25 billion in digital and energy infrastructure investment, intended to catalyze up to $60 billion more. “We are excited to partner with PPL to develop generation projects that will help Pennsylvania, and PJM, meet the growing demand for power driven by the digitization of the economy,” said Sebastien Sherman, Senior Managing Director at Blackstone Infrastructure on Tuesday. “Blackstone Infrastructure has a proven track record and commitment to long-term partnerships, and we look forward to working with PPL to power data centers across Pennsylvania and the broader PJM service territory.” A 'Creative Solution' Under the terms of the joint venture, PPL and Blackstone intend to enter into “long-term energy services agreements with regulated-like risk profiles that do not expose the co.. ."

O que torna Indomável um destaque no catálogo da Netflix A minissérie Indomável chega ao streaming com uma proposta ambiciosa: combinar um suspense policial envolvente com a exploração de um cenário natural único. O Parque Nacional de Yosemite, com suas florestas densas, montanhas imponentes e paredões rochosos, é mais do que um pano de fundo. A vastidão do parque, comparável ao estado de Rhode Island, cria uma atmosfera de isolamento e perigo, onde a tecnologia moderna tem pouco alcance, forçando os personagens a dependerem de instinto e habilidades próprias. Mark L. Smith, em entrevista à Netflix, revelou que a ideia era subverter a imagem idílica de Yosemite. “Queríamos mostrar que, além das paisagens de tirar o fôlego, há perigos reais, tanto da natureza quanto das pessoas que se escondem nela”, explicou. Essa abordagem confere à série uma tensão constante, com cenas que alternam entre investigações minuciosas e momentos de ação em terrenos traiçoeiros. A narrativa foca em Kyle Turner, um agente que prefere a solidão da natureza à interação humana. Seus traumas pessoais, como a perda do filho e a culpa por um caso anterior, moldam suas decisões e criam uma camada de complexidade ao personagem. A produção também destaca a parceria entre Turner e Naya Vasquez, uma guarda florestal novata interpretada por Lily Santiago, cuja persistência desafia a resistência inicial de Kyle. Cenário imersivo: As locações reais de Yosemite intensificam a experiência visual. Temas psicológicos: Traumas pessoais e segredos moldam os personagens. Comparação com True Detective: Reviravoltas e foco em personagens complexos. Elenco de peso eleva a qualidade de Indomável O elenco de Indomável é um dos grandes atrativos da minissérie. Eric Bana, também produtor executivo, entrega uma atuação intensa como Kyle Turner, um homem assombrado pelo passado, mas determinado a desvendar o crime. Sam Neill, conhecido por Jurassic Park, interpreta Paul Souter, o chefe dos guardas florestais, cuja lealdade a Turner pode esconder segredos. Lily Santiago, como Naya Vasquez, traz frescor à trama ao interpretar uma policial urbana que precisa se adaptar ao ambiente selvagem de Yosemite. Sua dinâmica com Bana é descrita como um misto de tensão e aprendizado mútuo, com momentos de humor que equilibram a narrativa densa. Wilson Bethel, de Demolidor: Renascido, vive Shane Macguire, um ex-ranger militar que atua como um antagonista enigmático, com uma relação complexa com Turner. Rosemarie DeWitt completa o elenco como Jill Bodwin, a ex-esposa de Kyle, adicionando camadas emocionais à trama. Eric Bana: Protagonista e produtor, com experiência em papéis intensos. Sam Neill: Um veterano que adiciona profundidade ao papel de Paul Souter. Lily Santiago: Revelação como a determinada Naya Vasquez. Wilson Bethel: Interpreta um antagonista com moral ambígua. Rosemarie DeWitt: Traz peso emocional como a ex-esposa de Turner. A química entre os atores é um dos pontos altos, especialmente na interação entre Kyle e Naya, que evolui de desconfiança para uma parceria sólida. A rivalidade entre Kyle e Shane, marcada por um passado compartilhado, também promete momentos de alta tensão. A produção por trás de Indomável A criação de Indomável envolveu um esforço significativo para capturar a essência do Parque Nacional de Yosemite...."

I waited months while she kept teasing us, and when she finally announced it was dropping on her website, I knew I had to have it. In March 2024, I placed my first Rhode order. I mean, I had to have the Lipcase, I needed it. I also grabbed the lip tints because I'd never bought from Rhode before. Usually, I like to try makeup in stores first, but when my order arrived, the lip tints looked and felt so good that I was hooked. That's when I became a Rhode fan for real. I was always on the lookout for new stuff. At first, I only bought makeup because I was scared it might irritate my skin. I used to stick to dermatological brands like Vichy and La Roche-Posay. But I was still curious about their skincare, and I thought, why not try the Rhode kit? Plus, I really wanted that bubble bag, but at the time, it wasn't available. Then, when they launched the Lip Shapes and I was placing an order, I saw the kit was back in stock, so I grabbed it. When I finally tried their skincare, I totally got why everyone's obsessed—it made my skin look amazing. Honestly, every Rhode product I've tried has never let me down.

What is your status? Over. A voice crackles over the radio, though it's difficult to hear over the copious amount of gunfire. Barney: Barney to Hal! I just lost half my squad! Suspect is HEAVILY armed and EXTREMELY dangerous! Hal: Hang in there Barney. Help is on the way. An agonizing scream was barely audible over the roar of a chainsaw. Barney: Jesus f***ing christ, WE JUST LOST LAZLO! A thunderous boom can be heard over the radio before the signal is lost completely. Hal: Barney? Barney, do you read? Shit........ Several patrol cars have already surrounded the burning duplex sandwiched between the laundromat and Café. Most of them were damaged beyond repair by copious amounts of gunfire. Nearby was a freshly made crater riddled with smoking shrapnel, as if an IED had just gone off. Hal's squad arrives to the sound of screaming and the faint scent of blood. He recognized Officer Lazlo's top half rotting in the back of his own trunk. His other half laid amidst the other bodies, all shot up and bloodied beyond recognition. The rest of Barney's squad was busy tending to the wounded, and the suspect is nowhere to be seen. Barney: Oh, thank God you're here sir. Hal: Just what the hell happened here? Barney: Someone called in a murder here on Portabello Street. We sent in two men and they......... never came out. That's when the suspect made his move. Things went pair shaped pretty fast. Hal: I can see that. Were there any other suspects? Barney: Nope........ just him, sir. Hal looks over to his squad mates attempting to ID the dead the best they can while they investigate the scene. Hal: You mean to tell me that one man caused ALL of this? Barney: I wouldn't say it was a *man* sir. It's another calm morning in the Showgrounds.

Alice Storm hasn't been welcome at her family's magnificent private island off the Rhode Island coast in five years—not since she was cast out and built her life beyond the Storm name, influence, and untold billions. But the shocking death of her larger-than-life father changes everything. Alice plans to keep her head down, pay her final respects (such as they are), and leave the minute the funeral is over. Unfortunately, her father had other plans. The eccentric, manipulative patriarch left his family a final challenge—an inheritance game designed to upend their world. The rules are clear: spend one week on the island, complete their assigned tasks, and receive the inheritance. But a whole week on Storm Island is no easy task for Alice. Every corner of the sprawling old house is bursting with chaos: Her older sister's secret love affair. Her brother's unyielding arrogance. Her younger sister's constant analysis of the vibes. Her mother's cold judgment. And all under the stern, watchful gaze of Jack Dean, her father's intriguing and too-handsome second-in-command. It will be a miracle if Alice manages to escape unscathed. A smart and tender story about the transformative power of grief, love, and family, this luscious novel explores past secrets, present truths, and futures forged in the wake of wild summer storms. #thesesummerstorms #audiobook #bookstagram #summerreads #books #bookrecommendations #bookreviewer"

mov_70E0981676FF20B81CDF2CC7A328AFE1,2025-07-18 02:38:15,en,WEB,"  SINGAPORE—The gala felt straight out of the movie “Crazy Rich Asians.” In this tropical-island nation famously dense with millionaires, 600 guests gathered in September 2023 to fete one of Singapore's most prominent success stories: the property empire that owns the global Millennium hotel chain and the Biltmore Los Angeles. The politicians, business leaders and foreign envoys in attendance heaped praise on the company's octogenarian executive chairman, Kwek Leng Beng, who built a family fortune estimated at $11.5 billion and made deals with the likes of Donald Trump. Guests at the black-tie dinner savored abalone, bird's nest soup and lobster, while dancers and musicians performed on a stage. At the head table, the tycoon, clad in a blue tuxedo, reigned with his wife, Cecilia. But there was another woman in the ballroom, wearing a red dress, whose presence wasn't welcome to some in the family. Catherine Wu, a Juilliard-trained pianist and former television host in her native Taiwan, was well-known to company executives for her close relationship with the chairman. Senior executives had long bristled at what they saw as her interference in the hotel business, according to people familiar with the matter. But until this moment, she had largely shunned the limelight and avoided public company events. The internal complaints about her outsize influence remained unknown to the public. Now Wu was thrusting herself into the spotlight, introducing herself to the dignitaries—including Singapore's prime minister-in-waiting—and posing for photos with them. Onlookers blanched. People sympathetic to Cecilia Kwek and concerned about Wu's influence at the company thought Wu, by attending the gala, had crossed a line. Earlier this year, the tensions that seethed at the event burst into the open. The chairman's elder son and chosen successor, Sherman Kwek, 49, and his allies moved to add new directors to the board, a maneuver he later said was meant to eliminate Wu's influence at the family business, called City Developments Ltd., or CDL for short. “She has been interfering in matters going well beyond her scope, and she wields and exercises enormous influence,” Sherman Kwek said in a statement on behalf of the majority of the board, issued in February after the feud erupted into public view. “Due to her long relationship with the chairman, efforts that were made to manage the situation were done sensitively, but to no avail.” Kwek Leng Beng fought back by trying to dismiss his son as chief executive and suing him for allegedly trying to usurp power—something that Sherman denies. The elder Kwek later said Wu had contributed to the business's success and decried his son's “unproven insinuations.” Wu, in her first public comments on the matter, told The Wall Street Journal in an email this month that her relationship to the chairman was “purely professional.” She said the elder Kwek had “asked for and considered my feedback on business ideas,” adding that she had “had no role in the decision-making process” at CDL. She said the dispute was between board members and “has nothing to do with me, although some parties have used my name to stoke the flames.” Weeks after the clash, the sides agreed to a truce. The public warring had done no good for a company dealing with high debt and a lackluster share price. In March, the elder Kwek announced Wu's resignation as an adviser at CDL's hotel subsidiary and dropped his lawsuit. His son remains CEO, backed by additional allies on the board and a company resolution declaring that Wu has no power to influence or direct management and staff at CDL and its hotel business. But Wu is still in contact with one person at CDL: the 84-year-old chairman. People at the company say the elder Kwek and Wu, who turns 66 this month, have recently been seen meeting at CDL-owned properties. It means, the people say, that the saga is far from over. Strictly business Just north of the equator, six million people swelter in a city-state about a quarter of Rhode Island's size. A disproportionate many are millionaires, and some of Singapore's richest residents are members of family businesses that predate the nation's 60 years of independence. As Singapore transformed from a colonial outpost into a hub of prosperity, the Kwek clan was there to help build it every step of the way. Kwek Leng Beng's father, Kwek Hong Png, started a construction-materials store in 1941, when Singapore was a British colony. Kwek Leng Beng joined the business in 1963 and was given stern training by his father, as he and Cecilia recounted in an authorized biography, “Strictly Business.” When the couple were dating, Kwek Leng Beng's father imposed a curfew. “The old man wanted him to be in bed by 9 p.m.,” Cecilia said in the biography. Kwek Leng Beng and Cecilia, both London-trained lawyers, wed in 1970. They spent much of the next few years in Singapore in the lobby of the company's first hotel, where she'd drink hot chocolate while he quizzed staff about occupancy rates and mingled with guests for feedback, the biography said. By the 1990s, Kwek was in charge of a flourishing family business that would eventually expand to more than 150 hotels worldwide, including Millennium hotels in New York and London. It controlled so much real estate in Singapore at one point that he was dubbed “Kwek Land Bank.” As part of a venture with a Saudi prince, CDL bought New York City's Plaza Hotel, the iconic establishment next to Central Park that's played host to royalty, presidents and the fictional Kevin McCallister in the 1992 movie “Home Alone 2.” They paid $325 million to buy it from Trump in 1995, and then sold it nine years later for $675 million. In the mid-2000s, Kwek advised Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson on building the Marina Bay Sands casino resort in Singapore. Today, it is a symbol of the island nation's skyline. Eyes and ears As the years went by, an adviser by Kwek's side became impossible for insiders to ignore. Catherine Wu, who holds a doctorate in music from New York University, was in her early 30s when she met Kwek in 1992 at a dinner party. She was well-known in Taiwan as a TV host and pianist, having released albums under the name Ingrid Wu with tracks such as “His Lover” and “I'll Decide Before Dawn Whether I Love You.” At the dinner, Kwek quizzed Wu about politics, economics and music “to see if my mind was flexible and if my answers were consistent,” Wu told a Singaporean newspaper last year...."

n3rna1r,2025-07-18 05:39:26,en,REDDIT,"  >Min wage for example is something well developed and more mature economies can deal with on a higher level because their cost of living is higher but smaller states with smaller economies affects them more. So if min wage is federally applied based on New York costs of living, ma and pa shops or even just small-mediuin sized businesses in BFE are eating the difference. Small states don't necessarily have immature economies. For example, the second smallest state, by population, is Vermont, and that's 17th for per capita income, including DC. Rhode Island is really small too, and that state is at 14th. A big issue you run into here is that you ultimately have interest in state size as a proxy for issues that are maybe correlated with state size, but it is, at best, messy. And, as a result, federal minimum wage isn't actually a big versus small state issue. It's a standard Democrat versus Republican issue, and big and small states fall on both sides of that actual political divide. What you are really describing here is that Republicans are somewhat less numerous, and so should get more votes. >You keep deflecting to comparing to black people and act like nothing in legislation affects each states economy directly. Deflecting? You're the one unwilling to answer this basic question. Of course legislation impacts the economic positioning of states. >Name me anything that doesn't affect a states economy that's come from legislation. I don't really understand the question or why it's pertinent. You want legislation that doesn't impact state economies? I'm sure I could find you some random bill that establishes a local statue as the best one in all of existence. >Now show me examples of legislation where black people are being uniquely affected. I dunno, how about anything related to the war on drugs, just to toss something out there? >you tried saying that immigration is different from farming like my premise was those two things needed to be the same. That's not what I was saying. What I was saying is that I have no idea what immigration has to do with small versus big states. It does have something to do with Democrats versus Republicans, which is another indication that this is just a proxy for giving Republicans more votes. >WTH do you mean? Look at voting patterns for elections small states have a very predictable pattern, there's a reason why ""swing states"" are a thing. Unless you're trying to pull some dumb technicality gotcha like ""hurr New York is smaller than Illinois geographically, I didn't mean in population"" What I mean is that a correlation between state size and voting pattern is not particularly causal or absolute, and, even if you did establish a very strong causal relationship that is incredibly prevalent, that still wouldn't give rise to this kind of meaningful group structure. Like, here's a question for you, one which I've implicitly posed a few times in this comment. The major commonality you're identifying, the difference in perspective and cause for enmity that you've hung your hat on, is that smaller states tend to vote Republican. If that's the case, why not just give anyone who votes Republican an extra vote? It's definitely a meaningful population with its own interest and sources of conflict with other groups. It's even somewhat smaller than the alternative, typically. I would say this is a bad idea, but it seems not only defensible within your logic, but actually a superior way to do what you want than this proxy structure."

0BC1F665A4AD08FC64B7485A0BD255AD,2025-07-18 07:03:37,en,PRINT,"  FEMA announced in April that it was ending the funding to eliminate ''waste, fraud and abuse.'' The program saved taxpayers more than $150 billion over 20 years, the plaintiffs said. A coalition of 20 states sued the Trump administration on Wednesday over its decision to shut down a multibillion-dollar grant program aimed at protecting communities from floods, hurricanes and other natural disasters. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Boston, accuses the Federal Emergency Management Agency of unlawfully terminating the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, or BRIC, without approval from Congress. The filing came two days after heavy rains inundated parts of New York and New Jersey and nearly two weeks after catastrophic floods hit Central Texas. ''New Jersey has repeatedly been hit by natural disasters including Sandy and Ida, which devastated our state with major loss of life and property,'' New Jersey's attorney general, Matthew J. Platkin, said in a statement. '' Now the Trump administration is attempting to illegally shut down BRIC, making it much harder for communities across our state to protect themselves against future extreme weather events and putting lives at risk.'' Representatives for FEMA and its parent agency, the Department of Homeland Security, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit. The states suing are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. The BRIC program was established in 2018 during President Trump's first term, replacing a similar FEMA initiative known as the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program. It has helped communities protect key infrastructure from extreme weather, including by raising roads in flood-prone areas and upgrading storm water management systems. In the past four years, FEMA selected nearly 2,000 projects to receive roughly $4.5 billion in BRIC grants, according to the lawsuit. Over two decades, the program and similar federal grants have saved taxpayers more than $150 billion that otherwise would have been spent on rebuilding property damaged or destroyed by disasters, the plaintiffs said. FEMA announced in April that it was shuttering the BRIC program as part of efforts to eliminate ''waste, fraud and abuse.'' ''The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program,'' the agency said in a news release at the time, which has since been taken down from the agency's website. '' It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.'' The news release offered no examples or evidence to back up that assertion. Just days into his second term, Mr. Trump suggested eliminating FEMA, calling the agency bloated and ineffective. But as the administration contends with the fallout of the deadly flooding in Texas, Mr. Trump and White House aides have begun emphasizing instead the desire to overhaul the agency."
ADF4ED5533DF433B24A922CFD9335200,2025-07-18 07:04:15,en,PRINT,"  An even more intense battle is expected on the Senate floor over the nomination of a Trump immigration policy enforcer to a lifetime judicial post. A Senate committee voted on Thursday to advance the nomination of Emil Bove III, the Justice Department enforcer who oversaw dozens of firings and the dismissal of bribery charges against Mayor Eric Adams of New York, to a lifetime post as a federal judge. Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee unanimously approved the nomination after Democrats stormed out in protest when the panel's chairman, Senator Charles E. Grassley, called the roll before every Democrat on the committee had a chance to air their objections. ''Sir, this lacks decency,'' said Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, his voice raised and visibly agitated. '' It lacks decorum. It shows that you do not want to simply hear from your colleagues. This is absolutely wrong!'' Mr. Grassley ignored him and plowed on. In a voice vote, committee Republicans voted to confirm Mr. Bove, 44, to a lifetime appointment on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, which encompasses Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Delaware. The vote was a prelude for what is expected to be an even more intense battle on the Senate floor over a nominee seen by his many critics of the embodiment of the administration's obliteration of institutional safeguards intended to shield the department from White House interference. Mr. Bove is more likely than not to be confirmed, barring any new developments that will sway several Republican senators to reject a lifetime judicial appointment for a taciturn and unyielding former Manhattan federal prosecutor who swiftly rose to prominence after serving on President Trump's criminal defense team. The vote came after Democrats waged a bitter effort to derail Mr. Bove's nomination by persuading Republicans on the committee to buck the White House, which has pushed hard to place a reliable Trump loyalist with an expansive view of executive power to a critical federal appellate court. In the days leading up to Mr. Bove's appearance before the committee, Erez Reuveni, a former immigration lawyer dismissed by Mr. Bove for insubordination, came forward to assert that Mr. Bove had told subordinates he was willing to ignore court orders to fulfill the president's aggressive deportation campaign. On Wednesday, more than 900 former Justice Department lawyers signed a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee expressing ''deep concern'' about the nomination of Mr. Bove. In the letter, the former department lawyers suggested that Mr. Bove had disgraced the department during his six months there, and that his confirmation would be ''intolerable.'' Mr. Bove defended himself against such claims during a testy confirmation hearing last month, telling the committee that he was not ''a henchman'' and that he had acted lawfully during his brief but eventful tenure at the department. He also defended Mr. Trump's right under the Constitution to fire career prosecutors without providing evidence of their misconduct. When pressed on his actions, Mr. Bove often refused to answer, citing attorney-client privilege and department rules against discussing investigations. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat from Rhode Island, ripped the Republican majority for failing to hold Mr. Bove to account for his actions. ''We can't even get answers,'' Mr. Whitehouse said, shortly before Mr. Grassley shut down the Democrats. The entire process, he added in exasperation, ''more resembled a rackets hearing from 'The Godfather' '' than a good-faith airing of the facts. Mr. Bove's deceptively modest title, principal associate deputy attorney general, belied his vast power in the department -- derived from his close relationship with the president and Mr. Trump's top domestic policy aide, Stephen Miller, who has played a central role in pushing the department's maximalist anti-immigration agenda. Because his post did not require Senate confirmation, Mr. Bove was among the first Trump appointees to arrive at the department, overseeing a succession of major policy and personnel moves, starting with a memo threatening to prosecute state and city officials who refused to carry out immigration enforcement. But the most defining episode of his tenure was the battle he waged against his former colleagues in the U.S. attorney's office for the Southern District of New York over the administration's request to drop bribery charges against Mr. Adams -- who had personally appealed to the White House for a legal reprieve. Mr. Bove pressured top prosecutors in the office to drop the case. He claimed that the charges had been brought by an overzealous Biden-appointed U.S. attorney and argued that the case would hinder Mr. Adams's capacity to cooperate with the White House on immigration enforcement. The interim U.S. attorney in Manhattan, Danielle R. Sassoon, resigned rather than sign off on Mr. Bove's command. Mr. Bove's current boss, the deputy attorney general, Todd Blanche, who served with him on Mr. Trump's legal team, accused Mr. Bove's critics of spreading slander and misinformation. ''Emil is the most capable and principled lawyer I have ever known,'' Mr. Blanche wrote in an opinion article for Fox News. '' His legal acumen is extraordinary, and his moral clarity is above reproach.'' Republicans on the committee also approved a slate of other judicial and legal appointments, including the nomination of the Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro to be the top federal prosecutor for the nation's capital. She was named the interim U.S. attorney for Washington and nominated for the permanent role after Mr. Trump was forced to pull his first choice for the position, Ed Martin.

So what exactly happened to Matt Rife, and what is next for the controversial comic? Matt Rife Netflix Controversy: Backlash Over 'Natural Selection' Joke Matt Rife's rise from internet favourite to Netflix headliner hit a snag in November 2023, when his stand-up special Natural Selection drew immediate criticism.In the opening minutes of his Netflix special Natural Selection, Rife joked that a restaurant hostess with a black eye must be unable to cook, suggesting her injuries were deserved, according to Entertainment Weekly. The joke prompted a social media firestorm, with advocacy groups and audiences accusing Rife of making light of abuse. Hashtags like #CancelMattRife and #NaturalSelectionNetflix began trending within hours of the special's release. Some viewers threatened to boycott the platform entirely.

Many called the response 'tone-deaf', while others saw it as a deliberate stance against what he labelled 'cancel culture'. Speaking to The Independent, Rife later defended the special, saying it was designed for 'a different audience' and claiming that several abuse survivors had reached out to thank him. He also revealed that fellow comedian Dave Chappelle had advised him not to apologise. ' If you apologise, you still lost,' Chappelle reportedly told him.

mov_AECC0F5517C7B7E1F8AC0265E12E6F0A,2025-07-18 09:01:11,en,WEB,"  WARWICK – The last time heavy metal band Metallica made an appearance in Rhode Island was at a packed Providence Civic Center – now the Amica Mutual Pavilion – in April 1997. The two-hour concert was part of the band's “Poor Touring Me” tour and featured hits such as “Enter Sandman,” “Nothing Else Matters” and “Master of Puppets.” Though it has been nearly two decades since Metallica last visited Rhode Island, the band is still rocking in the Ocean State through a scholarship at the (CCRI). This past school year CCRI was awarded $75,000 through the , founded by Metallica in 2017. The grant provides financial support for students enrolled in the college's medical assistant and patient support specialist workforce training programs. James Hetfield, Metallica's lead vocalist and guitarist, has explained in the past that the goal of the initiative is to break the stigma around trade skills. The foundation has invested over $10.5 million so far across 60 colleges and universities, helping over 8,000 students throughout the U.S. Jennie Johnson, associate vice president of institutional advancement at CCRI, explained the medical assistant and patient support specialist programs are highly sought at the school. The programs are eight to 16 weeks long and prepare students to go directly into work. CCRI partners with Brown University Health, Care New England and Thundermist Health Center to place students in jobs. Johnson said the biggest barrier for students – one third who are adults coming back to finish their education or switch careers – is financial needs. This is where the Metallica Scholars Initiative steps in, by providing funds to help with childcare, meals, housing, transportation and other needs. So far, 58 students at CCRI have benefited from the scholarship, with over half having completed their training. “The end goal is to help our students that might be facing challenges stay enrolled, graduate and get into a job,” Johnson said. She added that CCRI is in many ways the workforce engine of the state, with over 5,000 Rhode Islanders engaged through the college's programs every year. Esther Duran, a medical assistant at Brown University Health, said she cried when she learned she had been awarded $600 by the Metallica Scholars Initiative. The funds helped her buy scrubs and paid for transportation to school and work. The news triggered a small chain reaction of calls, with Duran calling her mom and her mom calling Duran's grandmother, all to celebrate the accomplishment. Duran said she was the first in her family to go to college. “It made me feel proud and motivated to succeed,” Duran said."

These zones have 500-meter radiuses around each facility (pylon) to ensure safety of life, property and the environment. The bluefin tuna bite has been so good in wind farm areas that it has attracted quite a tuna fleet. Anglers and mariners should monitor the Coast Guard channel 16 for areas with mandatory safety zones due to construction. Wind farm areas where the tuna bite is good include South Fork Wind Farm (completed) and the Revolution Wind Farm (under construction). The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management's Aquatic Resource Education program will hold three more ""Come Clam With Me"" events this year. They are scheduled for Aug. 12 from 2 to 5 p.m. at Rocky Point in Warwick, Aug. 25 from 2 to 5 p.m. at Gull Cove in Portsmouth and Sept. 9 from 3 to 6 p.m. at North Kingstown Town Beach. Participants learn how to dig for clams, about the equipment they'll need and the management strategies that support quahogging in Rhode Island. The program fee is $10 for registrants 8 and older.

Eric started fishing when he was a toddler on Rhode Island waters with his family. He would crab, fish and loved to go clamming. He was a member of the Rhode Island Saltwater Anglers Association along with his father.

Freshwater. “The largemouth bite is outstanding in just about every pond or lake that traditionally produces fish,"" said Tom Giddings of the Tackle Box in Warwick. ""Bait is working well with drop shots good in the day and top-water lures working well at night.” Jeff Sullivan of Lucky Bait & Tackle in Warren reported: “Both the smallmouth and largemouth bass bite is on. Anglers are hooking up with smallmouth bass using small shads, with frogs and spinner baits working well for largemouth bass."" Striped bass and bluefish. “The striped bass fishing is very good along the coastal shore, beaches and on reefs from boats,"" said Mike Wade of Watch Hill Outfitters in Westerly. ""There is not much bunker [Atlantic menhaden] in the water as forage but we do have a lot of mackerel. So baits that look like mackerel, like pencil lures, larger soft plastics, are working well. Bait-mimicking squid are working well, too.” Sullivan reported: “The striped bass bite was outstanding in front of Newport in the Brenton Reef area last week. We caught 30-plus-pound fish both with surface lure and with live eels.” Declan O'Donnell of Breachway Bait & Tackle in Charlestown reported: “The bigger bass have made their way into the salt ponds and are also abundant on local reefs. Live bait has been the key to hooking the larger fish."" Summer flounder (fluke), black sea bass and squeteague. “Anglers are hooking up with fluke at the Newport and Jamestown bridges [down to Dutch Island] in deeper water with a very good squeteague bite around Warwick Neck,” Giddings said. “The bite remains consistent, with mostly smaller fish being caught,"" O'Donnell reported. "" They've moved into deeper local waters, around 43 to 55 feet.” Wade reported: “The fluke bite has slowed down quite a bit along the southern coastal shore.” Sullivan said: “Anglers caught fluke fishing in 50 feet of water off Newport. Wednesday, however, they had to fish through a lot of shorts. Bucktails were working as well as high-low rigs.” The summer flounder and black sea bass bite is good for anglers fishing off the Sakonnet River over humps and bumps. We continue to catch squeteague, summer flounder and scup around Warwick Neck, particularly when on a perfect drift with wind and tide in line. Bluefin/yellowfin tuna, false albacore. “The yellowfin, bluefin tune and false albacore bite has been very, very good,"" Wade said. "" However, we had difficulty hooking up with mahi-mahi this week during our Tuesday offshore trip.” O'Donnell reported: “Tuna reports have been excellent this week, with most fish in the mid-40-inch range. Trolling with green, zucchini and purple side trackers has been successful, and some customers are also catching fish on jigs and plugs.” Dave Monti holds a captain's master license and charter fishing license.

mov_40BEDE8BFAA51185075E737FED791025,2025-07-18 09:28:59,en,WEB,"  July 18th, 2025 ( Ohio Capital Journal  - Delivered by  Newstex ) A voter shows identification to an election judge. (Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images) The sweeping requests raise fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information. The U.S. Department of Justice is seeking the voter registration lists of several states - representing data on millions of Americans - and other election information ahead of the 2026 midterms, raising fears about how the Trump administration plans to use the information. The DOJ is also demanding Colorado turn over all records related to the 2024 election, a massive trove of documents that could include ballots and even voting equipment. The Colorado inquiry, the most sweeping publicly known request, underscores the extent of the administration's attention on state election activities. At least nine states have received requests for information over the past three months, according to letters from the DOJ obtained by Stateline. Some states also received emails from a DOJ official last week asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements. The department's focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states. For years, Trump has advanced false claims about elections, including the idea that the 2020 election that he lost was stolen. Now back in power, his administration is taking a new level of interest in how states - and even local authorities - administer elections. Last week, a political operative approached several Republican county clerks in Colorado to enlist them in election integrity efforts in light of Trump's sweeping March executive order overhauling elections administration. One clerk told Stateline the operative claimed to represent the White House. 'Whatever the Trump administration tries to pull is very unlikely to be successful,' Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in an interview, calling Colorado elections very secure. ' With that said, do I think they are trying to undermine our elections at large in this country? Absolutely.' DOJ has sent letters to Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin, in addition to the request to Colorado. The letters have typically asked election officials to describe how they register voters and work to identify duplicate registrations and individuals not eligible to vote, such as people with felony convictions and those who have died. The Washington Post earlier Wednesday reported on the letters; Votebeat and NPR previously reported on some of the letters as well. Most letters also ask about each state's process for flagging noncitizen applicants. Noncitizen voting is against federal law and incredibly rare, but Trump and his allies have promoted false claims about its prevalence. The Trump administration is also conducting a general crackdown on illegal immigration. The letters call on election officials to turn over voter registration lists, which in some instances contain data on millions of residents in their states. This request has raised the most concerns, with some experts saying it's unclear exactly why the DOJ wants the information. 'They don't make much sense as law enforcement investigations. That makes me think that there's some other purpose,' said Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University. Trump's proof of citizenship elections order blocked for now in federal court 'Trump's proof of citizenship elections order blocked for now in federal court' - Rhode Island Current While many states make their voter registration lists available to the public, Levitt emphasized the data could still be largely off-limits to the federal government. Federal privacy law sometimes restricts how the government can use data that's publicly obtainable. The DOJ may need voter information in some individual circumstances, but 'that's not blanket permission to go vacuuming up data.' The DOJ didn't respond to questions for this story. Federal laws restrict the federal government's ability to centralize information on Americans, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. Even if states provide voter registration information to the public, they often redact sensitive information. In Orange County, California, the DOJ sued local election officials in June, seeking unredacted voter registration information, such as Social Security numbers and driver's licenses, as part of an investigation into noncitizen voting. More than 350 election officials from some 33 states participated in a conference call about federal actions on Monday hosted by Becker, who was previously an attorney in the DOJ Voting Rights Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said the interest in the call shows the level of uncertainty and anxiety over the current 'federal imposition' on election administrators. 'The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver's license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth - records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect,' Becker said. Sweeping Colorado requests In Colorado, the amount of data the DOJ wants is enormous. On May 12, Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general in the DOJ's Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Griswold, the secretary of state, asking for access to 'all records' related to the 2024 election. Federal law requires state election officials to preserve records related to elections for 22 months. Typically, the rule ensures records are preserved in case any lawsuits are filed over an election. In the letter, Dhillon referred to a complaint against Griswold's office alleging noncompliance with records retention laws, but provided no details. The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver's license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth - records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect. - David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research Experts on election administration who spoke to Stateline expressed shock at the scope of the demand to Colorado. The request encompasses a vast trove of material, potentially including ballots. 'The amount of records being requested from a place like Colorado it's really, really significant in terms of the volume of materials that are required to be retained,' said Neal Ubriani, a former voting rights litigator at the DOJ during the Obama and first Trump administrations and the current policy and research director at the nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government...."
mov_5C739BDA1778492665BB1429EBAA0B69,2025-07-18 09:41:33,en,WEB,"  Some of the best growth stocks are in the consumer space, and with tariffs still very much front and center, many of these stocks remain well off their highs. Nibbling on these names, say with an initial $1,000 investment, can be a good place to start. Let's look at five consumer-focused stocks to buy now while they're still on sale. These are all solid companies with a lot of potential growth still in front of them. Image source: . 1. Amazon While Amazon (AMZN 0.39%) has rallied from its lows, the stock is still off its highs and attractively valued from a historical perspective. And if there were thoughts that tariffs were slowing consumer spending, the company just announced its largest ever Prime Day sales event. Expanded to four days, the company generated $24.1 billion in sales, according to Adobe Analytics. That's more than double the sales it saw last Black Friday. While Amazon showed it still has what it takes to drive retail sales, what's most exciting about the company is what is going on behind the scenes. Years of investment in logistics, automation, robots, and artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off, and making operations even more efficient. This is leading to cost savings and strong operating leverage. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market-share leader in cloud computing, where customers are using its services to build and deploy their own AI models and tools. It's also developed its own custom chips for training and inference, which gives it both performance and cost advantages. For long-term investors, Amazon is a great stock to own. 2. Alibaba Alibaba (BABA 1.29%) is a stock that remains on sale. It trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 11 times and has more than 30% of its market cap in cash and investments. The stock is not just cheap, but it's executing on multiple fronts. Its cloud business has now seen AI-related revenue more than double for seven consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, Apple's decision to use Alibaba's Qwen model to power Apple Intelligence in China could be a solid growth driver. The company's e-commerce business has also seen a solid turnaround. Alibaba invested to grow Taobao and Tmall's gross merchandise value, and now it's better monetizing its platforms through new software fees and AI tools. It's also just started with new initiatives to help further drive growth, including offering one-hour delivery and embedding shoppable Taobao links in posts on the popular Chinese Rednote app. In addition, the company continues to grow and scale out its international e-commerce segment, and it expects it to turn profitable soon. Alibaba is still in the midst of its turnaround story, and at its current valuation there's a lot of upside if it continues to execute. 3. E.l.f. Beauty A sudden slowdown in growth last quarter has put e.l.f. Beauty's (ELF 2.20%) stock on the sales rack. However, its pending acquisition of Rhode looks like it could be transformative. E.l.f. has already been one of the biggest winners in the mass-market cosmetics space, and now it's adding a fast-growing premium brand to its portfolio. Rhode generated $212 million in sales over the past year with barely any paid marketing, a limited product lineup, and selling only through its website. That's impressive. Rhode was already set to enter Sephora stores, and now e.l.f. will have the opportunity to plug Rhode into its existing retail relationships, including those with Ulta Beauty and Target, while ramping up product development and marketing. Hailey Bieber remains onboard as chief creative officer, which should help maintain brand momentum as the product line expands. The strategy is smart. Premium skincare brands such as Rhode are simply going to have better margins than mass-market color cosmetics. This is a big opportunity for the company going forward and a reason to own the stock long term. 4. JAKKS Pacific Toy company JAKKS Pacific (JAKK 1.13%) has quietly become one of the best turnaround stories in consumer products. Under CFO John Kimble — formerly of Mattel and Disney — the company has streamlined operations, improved operating margins, and returned to consistent profitability. Shares are up more than 200% over the past five years, but down 30% this year on tariff worries. The result is that the stock trades at just 8.5 times 2025 analyst earnings per share estimates and 6 times the 2026 consensus. And it's not like the company is struggling. Sales jumped 26% in Q1, fueled by licensed products tied to Sonic the Hedgehog 3 and Disney's Moana 2. That momentum should continue with toy and costume launches tied to Dog Man, Minecraft, and Paw Patrol...."

mov_11A581895527CB5587FC03C0D57F1DCB,2025-07-18 09:55:00,en,WEB,"  PROVIDENCE – Matthew Osubor said he will never forget how a random act of kindness in a Whole Foods parking lot in Providence changed the course of his life. It was the spring of 2024, and as the 27-year-old aspiring filmmaker was entering the store, he noticed an orange fall out of another customer's shopping bag. He picked it up and handed it to the man. The two struck up a conversation, and, as it turns out, the man was film director, producer, and screenwriter Alexandre Rockwell, who has received top honors at major film festivals – including the Sundance Film Festival and the Berlin International Film Festival – and until recently was head of the directing program at New York University's graduate film school. “We talked for a while. He said that he and his wife [actress and author Karyn Parsons, who played spoiled teen Hilary Banks on the popular TV show “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air”] had recently moved to Providence,” said Osubor. “I told him I loved filmmaking and said, 'We should do something together.' Then he gave me his email address.” The two not only became fast friends, but Rockwell offered the 2019 Brown University graduate a role in one of his films, “The Projectionist,” last summer, and agreed to serve as the executive producer on Osubor's film, “Big Daddy's Flowers.” Filmed in and around Providence in May and June, it will be released in the coming weeks (the premiere will be in Providence, but a date and location have not been finalized). Osubor said he is currently considering distribution options. This film is about a flower delivery driver who, Osubor said, is trying to outrun the evils of his childhood. He's the success story of his town, because he's the only one of his friends who is not dead, in prison, or in rehab. “On the contrary, he has a good, decent job and he stays out of trouble … but in life even though you might try to avoid trouble, trouble can still find you,” he said. The protagonist begins to suspect that the life he's been living isn't actually what he thought it was and, as Osubor explained, “everything he knew and believed to be gospel was all just a facade. What happens when you have to choose not between 'good' and 'bad' options, but between the lesser of two evils?” The Hamilton, Ohio, native – an only child whose parents emigrated to the United States from Nigeria in 1997, a year before he was born – said he is “very proud” of “Big Daddy's Flowers,” which he made on a shoestring budget of just $2,000. Some of the cost-saving measures included starring as the lead – in addition to directing and producing – hiring non-actors, and working out a deal with Parsons to be in his film. “Karyn is the author of children's books and runs a nonprofit that tells children stories about the achievements of African Americans. She needed help with her website, so I told her I would do that if she would be a part of this film, since I could never afford her,” said Osubor, who since 2020 has owned a multimedia consulting company that develops media narrative campaigns for clients, including Narragansett Brewing Company, Google, and the New England branch of the Environmental Protection Agency. Osubor, who lives in Providence with roommates, said that filming in Rhode Island has been “wonderful” not only because it is less expensive than elsewhere, but people have been “so accommodating and supportive.” “I've found the infrastructure/community more open to risk-taking and enterprising filmmaking,” he said. “We had a lot of support rather than apprehension about what our intentions were.” Osubor didn't always want to be a filmmaker. His original plan was to go to law school after he graduated from Brown. But he changed his mind after an internship in a government legal office in Washington, D.C., where he witnessed behavior that “went against much of what I stand for.” It was his disenchantment with politics and witnessing the polarization of people with different viewpoints – and the importance of compromise – that sparked Osubor's idea for his feature film, which he referred to as “solid and vulnerable.” “Films are accessible to people and often take up a fair amount of space in public discourse,” he said. “I love literature [he majored in literary arts at Brown], but you don't hear people referencing [books] the way you hear them say, 'Hey, did you watch this series? Did you see this film?' ” [embedded content] Osubor is quick to point out that as much as he enjoyed making “Big Daddy's Flowers,” it didn't come without challenges – mostly due to minimal funding. But he said obstacles led to the necessity to “reorient your mind and look at things differently.” “Rejection should be viewed as a nudge … it had helped me to learn and grow,” he said. Rockwell, 68, a father of two who was raised in Cambridge, Mass., said he mentored and worked with many young filmmakers when he was at NYU, and he liked what he saw in Osubor and in his work. “His way of seeing things, his voice, his narrative … it's unique. He's fun and interesting and kind of odd. Right away I liked his work,” Rockwell said. “He's very talented and very eager and willing. He jumps right into a situation.” Osubor said he is grateful for Rockwell's support, mentorship, and now what has grown into a “great friendship.” He said Rockwell has been very helpful and he's looking forward to working in tandem with him to navigate next steps and “defy these norms, think differently and find solutions to whatever future roadblocks that might exist.” “This industry is becoming more accessible for filmmakers like me to enter the arena,” Osubor said, ”and the sense of confidence I've gained from making this film has been a great takeaway.”"

E.l.f. Beauty just made a transformative acquisition with Rhode. Cava has one of the biggest expansion opportunties in the restaurant space. Some of the best growth stocks are in the consumer space, and with tariffs still very much front and center, many of these stocks remain well off their highs. Nibbling on these names, say with an initial $1,000 investment, can be a good place to start. Let's look at five consumer-focused stocks to buy now while they're still on sale. These are all solid companies with a lot of potential growth still in front of them. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocksto buy right now. Continue Image source: Getty Images. 1. Amazon While Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has rallied from its lows, the stock is still off its highs and attractively valued from a historical perspective. And if there were thoughts that tariffs were slowing consumer spending, the company just announced its largest ever Prime Day sales event. Expanded to four days, the company generated $24.1 billion in sales, according to Adobe Analytics. That's more than double the sales it saw last Black Friday. While Amazon showed it still has what it takes to drive retail sales, what's most exciting about the company is what is going on behind the scenes. Years of investment in logistics, automation, robots, and  artificial intelligence (AI) are paying off, and making operations even more efficient. This is leading to cost savings and strong operating leverage. In addition, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the market-share leader in  cloud computing, where customers are using its services to build and deploy their own AI models and tools. It's also developed its own custom chips for training and inference, which gives it both performance and cost advantages. For long-term investors, Amazon is a great stock to own. 2. Alibaba Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) is a stock that remains on sale. It trades at a  forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of just 11 times and has more than 30% of its market cap in cash and investments. The stock is not just cheap, but it's executing on multiple fronts. Its cloud business has now seen AI-related revenue more than double for seven consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, Apple's decision to use Alibaba's Qwen model to power Apple Intelligence in China could be a solid growth driver. The company's e-commerce business has also seen a solid turnaround. Alibaba invested to grow Taobao and Tmall's gross merchandise value, and now it's better monetizing its platforms through new software fees and AI tools.

Alibaba is still in the midst of its turnaround story, and at its current valuation there's a lot of upside if it continues to execute. 3. E.l.f.

We are going to LA Charger's training camp. I really have no idea what they do but going it hang with the family. ☔️ These Summer Storms by Sarah MacLean, narrated by Julia Whalen Alice Storm hasn't been welcome at her family's magnificent private island off the Rhode Island coast in five years—not since she was cast out and built her life beyond the Storm name, influence, and untold billions. But the shocking death of her larger-than-life father changes everything. Alice plans to keep her head down, pay her final respects (such as they are), and leave the minute the funeral is over. Unfortunately, her father had other plans. The eccentric, manipulative patriarch left his family a final challenge—an inheritance game designed to upend their world. The rules are clear: spend one week on the island, complete their assigned tasks, and receive the inheritance. But a whole week on Storm Island is no easy task for Alice. Every corner of the sprawling old house is bursting with chaos: Her older sister's secret love affair. Her brother's unyielding arrogance. Her younger sister's constant analysis of the vibes. Her mother's cold judgment. And all under the stern, watchful gaze of Jack Dean, her father's intriguing and too-handsome second-in-command. It will be a miracle if Alice manages to escape unscathed. ⭐️ My rating: Loved it ⭐ When I hear a book is about family drama, I am automatically intrigued. The Storm family is back in their private island for as the patriarch of the family has passed. This story packs so much emotion with the grief, fractured family, and love. Jack who was the dad's right hand man must also stay on the island and ensure all the family members so as asked. Jack and Alice have an instant attraction and I really liked how they were together. I love when a story's side characters all play a big role in the story and each of the sibling truly were standout characters. Julia Whalen, as always, does a phenomenal job with the narration. #asbwbookreview #thesesummerstorms #audiobook"
mov_B6DF54CFE3F823F4B20915650FC13FCD,2025-07-18 12:34:50,en,WEB,"  On a quiet Sunday in mid-July 2025, celebrity power couple Olivia Culpo and NFL star Christian McCaffrey welcomed their first child, a baby girl named Colette Annalise McCaffrey. The joyous news was shared with the world through a heartfelt Instagram post that immediately captured the hearts of fans and media alike. The couple's announcement was simple yet profound, with the caption reading just the baby's full name, ""Colette Annalise McCaffrey,"" accompanied by tender black-and-white images of Olivia holding her newborn, Christian standing by her side in a gentle embrace. The name Colette Annalise is already trending across social media platforms, admired for its blend of strength, elegance, and spiritual significance. Colette, rooted in French origins, means ""victorious"" or ""people of victory,"" while Annalise, with German and Latin roots, translates to ""graced with God's bounty."" Experts and parenting forums have praised the name for its vintage charm and lyrical flow, reflecting a balance of resilience and grace that seems perfectly suited for the couple's new chapter. Olivia Culpo, former Miss Universe and a beloved figure in the fashion and entertainment world, first announced her pregnancy in February 2025. She shared a radiant photo showcasing her baby bump in a flowing white maternity gown with the caption, ""Our biggest blessing yet."" Throughout her pregnancy, Olivia chose to keep the journey intimate, offering fans only meaningful glimpses into this transformative time. Her reflections resonated deeply, such as when she wrote, ""Motherhood is the role I dreamed of more than any other,"" highlighting the emotional and spiritual significance of becoming a mom. Christian McCaffrey, known for his athletic prowess as a running back for the San Francisco 49ers, revealed a softer, more vulnerable side during this period. In a May 2025 press appearance, he expressed his excitement, saying, ""I can't wait to meet her,"" showing a heartfelt commitment to fatherhood despite the demands of his NFL season. The couple, who tied the knot in July 2023 in Rhode Island, have long been admired for their low-key love and strong family values, making this new chapter a natural progression in their story. Beyond the public announcement and the celebration of Colette's name, Olivia Culpo also shared insights into her very personal hospital experience, which quickly went viral. Known for her candidness and authenticity, Olivia revealed her ""over-the-top"" hospital bag in a popular video that sparked plenty of conversation. She packed two large suitcases: one dedicated entirely to comfort items and the other filled with postpartum essentials and baby care necessities. Her comfort suitcase was a treasure trove of thoughtful items, including two favorite pillows, twin-size comforters for both herself and Christian, sleep masks, mini fans, aromatherapy products, flameless flickering candles, a fluffy robe, and even a framed photo of her dog. The latter detail amused many online, with commenters joking about the sentimental touch. Olivia stood by her choices, explaining on Instagram Stories after delivering her daughter that she used everything she packed, especially during her recovery from a C-section that kept her in the hospital for over three days. She praised the flameless candles in particular, noting their remote-controlled feature which allowed her to avoid the harsh fluorescent hospital lights without needing to get up—a significant comfort during a difficult recovery. Olivia's candid sharing of these details resonated with many new and expectant mothers, highlighting the importance of personal comfort and emotional well-being during such a pivotal life event. The second suitcase was packed with practical items essential for postpartum care and newborn needs. This included two Frida Mom recovery kits tailored for both C-section and vaginal births, a Momcozy nursing bra with pads, nipple butter, Medela hydrogel pads, a breast pump, various supplements and electrolytes, lactation drink mixes, snacks, a high-quality camera, headphones, chargers, extension cords, makeup, toiletries, slippers, shower shoes, nursing-friendly clothes, wide-fit shoes, a sound machine, a baby footprint and handprint kit, newborn outfits, onesies, swaddles, blankets, and even cord and placenta collection kits. This meticulous preparation underscores the couple's thoughtful approach to parenthood, blending comfort, practicality, and a touch of luxury. It also reflects Olivia's desire to maintain a sense of control and calm during the unpredictability of childbirth and recovery. The arrival of Colette Annalise McCaffrey marks a new season not just for Olivia and Christian but for their fans and followers who have watched their journey with admiration. Their story, once defined by runway lights and NFL stadiums, now embraces the quieter, profound moments of family life and faith. The name Colette Annalise, with its echoes of victory and divine grace, seems a fitting emblem of this transformation. As the couple steps into parenthood, their greatest legacy may well lie in these tender, everyday moments that define family and love. The world watches eagerly as Olivia Culpo and Christian McCaffrey write this new chapter, one filled with hope, strength, and an enduring sense of purpose."
mov_7D7DA5203AC7112B85DED0CC7546BEF3,2025-07-18 12:42:02,en,WEB,"  Sherman Kwek was the chosen successor at a Singapore real-estate empire. Then he tried to push out his billionaire father's adviser, a Juilliard-trained pianist SINGAPORE—The gala felt straight out of the movie “Crazy Rich Asians.” In this tropical-island nation famously dense with millionaires, 600 guests gathered in September 2023 to fete one of Singapore's most prominent success stories: the property empire that owns the global Millennium hotel chain and the Biltmore Los Angeles. The politicians, business leaders and foreign envoys in attendance heaped praise on the company's octogenarian executive chairman, Kwek Leng Beng, who built a family fortune estimated at $11.5 billion and made deals with the likes of Donald Trump. Guests at the black-tie dinner savored abalone, bird's nest soup and lobster, while dancers and musicians performed on a stage. At the head table, the tycoon, clad in a blue tuxedo, reigned with his wife, Cecilia. But there was another woman in the ballroom, wearing a red dress, whose presence wasn't welcome to some in the family. Catherine Wu, a Juilliard-trained pianist and former television host in her native Taiwan, was well-known to company executives for her close relationship with the chairman. Senior executives had long bristled at what they saw as her interference in the hotel business, according to people familiar with the matter. But until this moment, she had largely shunned the limelight and avoided public company events. The internal complaints about her outsize influence remained unknown to the public. Now Wu was thrusting herself into the spotlight, introducing herself to the dignitaries—including Singapore's prime minister-in-waiting—and posing for photos with them. Onlookers blanched. People sympathetic to Cecilia Kwek and concerned about Wu's influence at the company thought Wu, by attending the gala, had crossed a line. Earlier this year, the tensions that seethed at the event burst into the open. The chairman's elder son and chosen successor, Sherman Kwek, 49, and his allies moved to add new directors to the board, a maneuver he later said was meant to eliminate Wu's influence at the family business, called City Developments Ltd., or CDL for short. Kwek Leng Beng, shown here in April, oversees a family fortune that Forbes estimated last year to be worth $11.5 billion.Sherman Kwek is the chief executive of City Developments Ltd. and his father's designated successor. “She has been interfering in matters going well beyond her scope, and she wields and exercises enormous influence,” Sherman Kwek said in a statement on behalf of the majority of the board, issued in February after the feud erupted into public view. “Due to her long relationship with the chairman, efforts that were made to manage the situation were done sensitively, but to no avail.” Kwek Leng Beng fought back by trying to dismiss his son as chief executive and suing him for allegedly trying to usurp power—something that Sherman denies. The elder Kwek later said Wu had contributed to the business's success and decried his son's “unproven insinuations.” Wu, in her first public comments on the matter, told The Wall Street Journal in an email this month that her relationship to the chairman was “purely professional.” She said the elder Kwek had “asked for and considered my feedback on business ideas,” adding that she had “had no role in the decision-making process” at CDL. She said the dispute was between board members and “has nothing to do with me, although some parties have used my name to stoke the flames.” Catherine Wu has been a longtime adviser to the elder Kwek. Weeks after the clash, the sides agreed to a truce. The public warring had done no good for a company dealing with high debt and a lackluster share price. In March, the elder Kwek announced Wu's resignation as an adviser at CDL's hotel subsidiary and dropped his lawsuit. His son remains CEO, backed by additional allies on the board and a company resolution declaring that Wu has no power to influence or direct management and staff at CDL and its hotel business. But Wu is still in contact with one person at CDL: the 84-year-old chairman. People at the company say the elder Kwek and Wu, who turns 66 this month, have recently been seen meeting at CDL-owned properties. It means, the people say, that the saga is far from over. Strictly business Just north of the equator, six million people swelter in a city-state about a quarter of Rhode Island's size. A disproportionate many are millionaires, and some of Singapore's richest residents are members of family businesses that predate the nation's 60 years of independence. As Singapore transformed from a colonial outpost into a hub of prosperity, the Kwek clan was there to help build it every step of the way. Kwek Leng Beng's father, Kwek Hong Png, started a construction-materials store in 1941, when Singapore was a British colony. Kwek Leng Beng joined the business in 1963 and was given stern training by his father, as he and Cecilia recounted in an authorized biography, “Strictly Business.” Singapore in the 1940s. The Kwek family has helped transformed the city over the past several decades. When the couple were dating, Kwek Leng Beng's father imposed a curfew. “The old man wanted him to be in bed by 9 p.m.,” Cecilia said in the biography. Kwek Leng Beng and Cecilia, both London-trained lawyers, wed in 1970. They spent much of the next few years in Singapore in the lobby of the company's first hotel, where she'd drink hot chocolate while he quizzed staff about occupancy rates and mingled with guests for feedback, the biography said. By the 1990s, Kwek was in charge of a flourishing family business that would eventually expand to more than 150 hotels worldwide, including Millennium hotels in New York and London. It controlled so much real estate in Singapore at one point that he was dubbed “Kwek Land Bank.” As part of a venture with a Saudi prince, CDL bought New York City's Plaza Hotel, the iconic establishment next to Central Park that's played host to royalty, presidents and the fictional Kevin McCallister in the 1992 movie “Home Alone 2.” They paid $325 million to buy it from Trump in 1995, and then sold it nine years later for $675 million. In the mid-2000s, Kwek advised Las Vegas casino magnate Sheldon Adelson on building the Marina Bay Sands casino resort in Singapore...."

The Vatican said a baby born in 2007 was inexplicably healed after a prayer to Father Salvador Valera Parra. The story was reported Friday by GoLocalProvidence. According to a report by The Dicastery for the Causes of Saints, the premature child, named Tyquan, was born by emergency cesarian section at Memorial Hospital of Rhode Island in Pawtucket in 2007 and was not expected to survive. The child suffered from oxygen deprivation and other symptoms that did not improve after an hour. The attending physician, who was Spanish and a devotee of Valera Parra, prayed for intercession. The dicastery said the child's heart began to beat with no medical intervention. The child was put in neonatal intensive care at Women & Infants Hospital. Doctors expected he would have neurological damage. The dicastery said the child began speaking at 18 months and walking at 2 years. “Little Tyquan continued his growth as a normal child by leading a regular life and playing sports,” the dicastery said. The miracle, approved by the pope, puts Valera Parra on a path to beatification. Memorial Hospital closed in 2018."

(WPRI) — Pope Leo XIV, the first pope from the United States, recently declared that a miracle happened in Rhode Island. The official decree signed on June 20 said that a baby born in 2007 was inexplicably healed after a doctor prayed to a 19th century Spanish priest, Father Salvador Valera Parra. According to a report by The Dicastery for the Causes of Saints, a boy identified only as ""Tyquan"" was born prematurely at Memorial Hospital in Pawtucket and was not expected to survive. The child reportedly suffered from oxygen deprivation and other symptoms that weren't improving. The attending physician, who was Spanish and a devotee of Valera Parra, prayed for intercession. The child's heart then began to beat with no medical intervention. ""The miracle at the former Memorial Hospital in Pawtucket in 2007 is a reminder of the power of prayer and the intercession of holy men and women. God is indeed close to us,"" the Diocese of Providence said in a statement. ""We are thrilled that this recognition will move the cause of beatification and canonization forward for Venerable Servant of God Salvador Valera Parra,"" the Diocese continued. The application for declaring it a miracle has been under consideration for years by church leaders. This story was first reported by GoLocalProv.

mov_F5D0EB995D0BB245DA42CE09E49CF886,2025-07-18 17:00:54,fr,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Lorsque Hailey Bieber mise sur une teinte, le monde de la mode suit. Cette saison encore, l'influenceuse impose son rythme avec une couleur inattendue qu'elle affiche subtilement, par petites touches, dans ses dernières apparitions. Ongles, accessoires, détails de maquillage… Tout semble indiquer que cette nuance bien précise s'apprête à teinter l'été 2025. Une couleur qui intrigue et s'impose déjà auprès des initiées. Rien d'étonnant quand on sait que la moindre tendance validée par Hailey Bieber finit souvent par coloniser les feeds Instagram avant de s'imposer dans les rayons des grandes enseignes. Jaune butter out, lemontini in : Hailey Bieber retourne la tendance Le butter yellow avait pourtant tout pour durer : pastel, flatteur et largement adopté sur les podiums de Chanel à Miu Miu, il s'était imposé comme la couleur du moment, embrassant vestes en toile, robes minimalistes et soies délicates. La mode semblait avoir trouvé dans cette nuance beurre une nouvelle base neutre pour l'été. Mais c'était sans compter sur l'intervention d'Hailey Bieber, qui, en une simple story Instagram, a signé la fin de règne du jaune doux. ""Le butter yellow est dépassé... respectueusement"", a-t-elle tranché, balayant la tendance d'un revers de main parfaitement manucurée. Depuis, un nouveau jaune s'impose en douce : plus franc, plus vif, presque citronné, il s'écarte du pastel pour injecter une touche acidulée dans le vestiaire estival. Baptisée lemontini, cette nuance plus affirmée s'annonce comme la couleur à suivre. Une prise de position qui bouscule les moodboards des stylistes et replace Hailey Bieber en arbitre redoutée des tendances. Jaune lemontini : la couleur qui électrise l'été 2025 Il fallait s'y attendre. Le jaune citron, longtemps resté en marge des podiums, signe son grand retour sous un nom un peu plus branché : lemontini. Une nuance fraîche et lumineuse, directement inspirée des étés méditerranéens, qui n'a rien d'une nouveauté mais que la mode redécouvre grâce à un coup de pouce inattendu. Jacquemus, Genny et quelques autres avaient amorcé le mouvement, glissant ici et là des touches de jaune acide dans leurs collections. Mais c'est Hailey Bieber qui, une fois encore, a transformé la tendance discrète en phénomène global. La fondatrice de Rhode a en effet joué la carte du jaune flashy pour rhabiller son célèbre baume à lèvres, lancé en édition spéciale sous le nom ""Lemontini"". Résultat : un simple tube citronné est devenu le nouvel accessoire fétiche des it-girls, qui s'affichent désormais toutes baume à la main, de Romee Strijd à Alexandra Saint Mleux. Derrière le succès de cette nuance ? Une stratégie marketing aussi millimétrée qu'efficace, qui a propulsé le jaune lemontini au rang de couleur de l'été, reléguant sans ménagement le butter yellow au rayon des tendances déjà vues. Le jaune lemontini passe du dressing à la trousse beauté Mais la mode ne s'arrête pas là. Le lemontini s'invite désormais dans les routines beauté. Hailey Bieber elle-même l'a adopté jusqu'au bout des ongles, optant pour une ""dot manicure"" minimaliste où le jaune vif sert de toile de fond. Sur les paupières, les make-up artists s'amusent à revisiter les aplats 80's façon citron pressé, tandis que les lèvres prennent une teinte légèrement dorée ou acidulée selon les marques. Le jaune lemontini ne se porte plus seulement sur les vêtements, il devient un véritable statement beauty. Pas étonnant, donc, que la sphère mode s'empresse de suivre. Avec son allure solaire mais plus tranchée que le pastel, le jaune lemontini promet d'apporter une dose d'énergie aux looks estivaux, tout en s'imposant comme un choix moins attendu que les habituels pastels de saison. Plus vif, plus moderne, ce jaune citron s'impose sur les robes en lin, les accessoires, et jusqu'aux détails de maquillage, devenant la touche acidulée indispensable de l'été 2025. Et, une fois de plus, c'est Hailey Bieber qui, en associant instinct mode et marketing redoutable, signe le coup d'envoi."
mov_9F91C3465AEB90BF6A143FFD54959E33,2025-07-18 17:04:00,en,WEB,"  A team aboard the Ocean Exploration Trust's Exploration Vessel (E/V) Nautilus located The Imperial Japanese Navy destroyer Teruzuki (照月) on the seafloor of Iron Bottom Sound, July 12, 2025. After more than 80 years since the vessels sinking, the discovery marks a significant moment in maritime archaeology and World War II history. The wreck was found at a depth exceeding 800 meters using cutting-edge seafloor mapping and remotely operated vehicle (ROV) technology. The target was initially identified by the University of New Hampshire's uncrewed surface vessel (USV) DriX, then visually confirmed by ROVs launched from E/V Nautilus. “I feel so lucky to see this ship. The fact that we have not seen Teruzuki in over 80 years underscores the importance of recording maritime heritage now,” Hiroshi Ishii, Nautilus science team member, program-specific researcher at the Center for Southeast Asian Area Studies at Kyoto University. “As a Japanese person, I appreciate the opportunity to witness part of our history and to be part of an international team shedding light on this campaign, which is important to all of our nations' history.” Commissioned in 1942, Teruzuki—meaning “Shining Moon” or “Illuminated Moon”—was a 134-meter Akizuki-class destroyer built to defend aircraft carriers from aerial attack. However, it was lost during surface combat operations in the Guadalcanal campaign. The destroyer served as flagship to Rear Adm. Raizō Tanaka, a renowned tactician in night operations and resupply missions. On Dec. 12, 1942, Teruzuki was struck by two American Mk-8 torpedoes near Cape Esperance, disabling the rudder and igniting fires. Although Adm. Tanaka and most of the crew survived, nine sailors were killed before the ship ultimately sank. ""The discovery of Rear Admiral Tanaka's flagship Teruzuki was made by a multidisciplinary, international team who together documented its remains, uncovering Teruzuki's significance to former combatant, and now allied, nations,"" said Phil Hartmeyer, marine archaeologist, NOAA Ocean Exploration. ""Only by exploring our planet's unknown waters can these significant stories of sacrifice and human connection to our ocean be brought to light."" When the exploration team found a 19-meter-long severed segment of Teruzuki's stern littered with depth charges, it disproved a long-held theory that it was depth charge explosions that sealed the ship's fate. Severed by the torpedo strikes, Teruzuki's stern was found more than 200 meters from the hull and located by high-resolution ROV sonar scans. The ship was found with its forward artillery turrets pointing skyward, illustrating its original purpose as a warship for a different type of battle. Using historical references, experts confirmed the identity of the ship. The discovery is part of an ongoing multinational mission supported by NOAA Ocean Exploration through the Ocean Exploration Cooperative Institute. To date, the expedition has documented 12 World War II maritime heritage sites. Dozens more shipwrecks are believed to remain undisturbed in Iron Bottom Sound, the site of five major naval battles between August and December 1942. Led by Ocean Exploration Trust President Dr. Robert Ballard, the expedition brings together a broad team of partners, including the U.S. Naval History and Heritage Command, NOAA Ocean Exploration, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Rhode Island, and multiple international collaborators. Live footage and educational outreach from the mission are streamed at www.NautilusLive.org, allowing the global public to engage with the expedition in real time.

Beauty deal in May Michelle Lee Link copied Jerritt Clark/ Justin Bieber and Hailey Bieber in 2023 NEED TO KNOW A rep for Hailey Bieber confirms to PEOPLE that the $1 billion from Rhode's e.l.f. Beauty acquisition has nothing to do with husband Justin Bieber's financial settlement Rumors began circulating that Justin Bieber postponed the settlement until Hailey's deal was funded, but her rep says the deal is ""separate"" from the singer's ""business affairs"" Earlier this month, the singer agreed to pay his former manager Scooter Braun $31.5 million, a majority of which will go toward an advance for his Justice Tour that Braun's company had covered Hailey Bieber is standing on business, despite what rumors may say about where the money from her $1 billion Rhode deal is going. Earlier this month, her husband, Justin Bieber, settled a financial dispute with his former manager Scooter Braun. The singer, 31, agreed to pay $26 million to Braun's former company HYBE as part of an advance the singer received from AEG Presents for his ultimately canceled 2022 Justice Tour, plus an additional $5.5 million to cover half of the $11 million in unpaid commissions he owed Braun. TMZ was first to report on July 10 that Bieber and Braun settled the dispute, the same day it was revealed that Bieber would be releasing his seventh album, Swag, and that he had launched his fashion brand SKYLRK. Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic Justin and Hailey Bieber at the 2022 Grammys At the same time, rumors began circulating that the Grammy winner waited to settle his debt after Hailey, 28, secured her $1 billion from e.l.f Beauty's acquisition of her brand Rhode in May. However, a rep for Hailey confirms to PEOPLE that Rhode's business move is in no way associated with her husband's settlement. “The historic sale of rhode is a huge accomplishment for Hailey and is completely separate from her husband and his business affairs."" The acquisition of Hailey's company, which she launched in 2022, occurred on May 28. She will continue her role as founder and additionally serve as Rhode's chief creative officer and head of innovation, overseeing creative, product innovation and marketing.

She can't wait to take Rhode global. She also received a generous cash payout as part of the deal."" During an appearance at the Business of Beauty Global Forum on June 10, the mom of one said she had a good feeling about the business proposition. “I remember walking away like, 'They're it,'” she recalled. “I knew it in my gut. We just said so many of the same things."" She also called Rhode ""her baby,"" so the idea of even partnering up was a ""very, very big deal.""

mov_69E85B13AA3441FB7C9EF7B4D6415DC6,2025-07-18 17:41:08,en,WEB,"  (NewsNation) – The personal health information of 79 million people will soon be in the hands of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials, who will use the data trove to track down immigrants in the United States illegally. ICE plans to use the nation's Medicaid database to ""receive identity and location information on aliens identified by ICE,” according to an agreement obtained by the Associated Press. Information available to ICE officials will include: Addresses Birthdates Ethnic and racial information Social Security numbers Some GOP members want protections for undocumented farm workers The agreement between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Homeland Security does not allow ICE officials to download the data. Instead, officials will be allowed to access the data for a limited period from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, until Sept. 9. Medicaid is only available to noncitizens in emergencies While immigrants who have entered and remained in the U.S. illegally are not eligible for Medicaid, every state is required to provide emergency Medicaid coverage for life-saving situations. Some states also make exceptions for children and certain adults. That means, despite not qualifying for the federally funded coverage, some noncitizens' information is still available in Medicaid records. UK plans to lower voting age to 16. Could it happen in the US? The Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that emergency care for undocumented patients accounted for less than 1% of Medicaid spending from 2017 to 2023. Democrats, advocates slam ICE-Medicaid data disclosure Politicians and immigrant advocates alike have opposed the agreement due to concerns over data privacy and human rights violations. Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., said on social media that ""the massive transfer of the personal data of millions of Medicaid recipients should alarm every American."" Immigration attorney Anibal Romero echoed Schiff's concerns. ""So eventually, what could end up happening is someone might transfer information about … a U.S. citizen, with a Latino name, and all of a sudden, now I have ICE officers in my house, even though I was born here only because my name is Raul Lopez,"" Romero told NewsNation. ""So it's scary. I think it's wrong."" Rhode Island police under investigation over ICE arrest Early this month, a coalition of 20 Democrat-led states sued the Trump administration over the agreement. California Attorney General Rob Bonta said it has ""created a culture of fear that will lead to fewer people seeking vital emergency medical care."" ""We're headed to court to prevent any further sharing of Medicaid data — and to ensure any of the data that's already been shared is not used for immigration enforcement purposes,"" Bonta added. What's included in $9B rescissions bill approved by House? In a statement, DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said the agencies are “exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.” The White House has deferred questions about the agreement to ICE, but the Trump administration has continued to argue that this type of access is necessary for its immigration crackdown. NewsNation's Anna Kutz and the Associated Press contributed to this report."

Jeff Gorman and Jake Cochran of Illiterate Light are on a 700 mile bicycle trip from Harrisonburg, Virginia, to Rhode Island passing through Pennsylvania with stops along the Jersey Shore. The pair is set to perform at the famed Newport Folk Festival for the fifth year and are bringing their innovative bike and solar-powered stage. For Jake and Jeff, this is a green tour promoting the importance of sustainability in a changing climate. “For us, this is a really DIY approach to spreading the gospel of getting on your bicycle as a great alternative to just being in your car all the time,” Jeff explained. They rolled into Asbury Park on Thursday, July 17 and will put on a show in town Friday evening. You can join them on a social bike ride around Asbury Park before their set on Friday. Just show up at the Carousel Building at 5:45 p.m. “This felt like an amazing way to get out, get active, invite other people along,” Jake said. “We really wanted to elevate, we wanted to keep pushing ourselves.” This 14 day adventure is to help pedal solutions for future generations, they said. “What's it going to be like to be a touring musician 10 years from now, 20 years from now, 30 years from now?” Jeff asked. “These are questions that we have to ask collectively.” This story uses functionality that may not work in our app. Click here to open the story in your web browser."

Season 3 of 'The Summer I Turned Pretty' features UNC Chapel Hill as Finch College. Author Jenny Han ('02 alumna) used her UNC experience to shape the fictional campus. Filming locations include UNC landmarks and Wilmington's coastal Cousins Beach stand-in. The final chapter of “The Summer I Turned Pretty” series is picking up in a different part of North Carolina. Instead of the fictional Cousins Beach shot along the coast, the third season starts out at Finch College — which is actually the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. “It's the end of her junior year of college, and Belly's looking forward to another summer in Cousins with her soulmate, Jeremiah. Her future seems set, until some core-shaking events bring her first love Conrad back into her life,” Prime Video's description of the third season says. The hit drama show is based on the bestselling trilogy by Jenny Han, who drew from her own college experience when picking the campus for the fictional Finch College. Those who've read the books may remember that the Fischer brothers are huge UNC fans and that “Conrad could talk about Carolina basketball forever.” While UNC isn't specifically mentioned in this season, the best-selling author and show runner did bring a touch of Tar Heel magic to the TV show for what's supposed to be a small Rhode Island college, as reported by the university. Finch College TSITP “I think that Carolina is one of the most beautiful campuses in the country. We were only a couple of hours away, so why not try? I was thrilled when the University said yes,” Han, a '02 alumna, told The Well. “So many of the cast and crew have said to me, 'This is the most beautiful campus I've ever been on.' That makes me proud. I'm proud to show it off.” Last summer, Christopher Briney and Lola Tung, who play Conrad Fisher and Isabel “Belly” Conklin were spotted around UNC's campus and parts of downtown Chapel Hill, The News & Observer previously reported. In the first two episodes, which premiered Wednesday, July 16 on Prime Video, you may even recognize a few notable spots on campus, including McCorkle Place and Old East — which was also her old dorm. “Belly goes to Finch, a smaller school in the northeast, but I always imagined it with the classic collegiate charm Carolina has. It's somewhere you want to spend time,” Han told The Well. “Carolina is a place that supports and fosters young people's dreams, and I wanted to give Belly that college experience.” Like previous seasons, much of this season was also filmed around the Wilmington area, which is depicted as the fictional Cousins Beach.

mov_C99350F1629DA53F63761BF109022799,2025-07-18 18:32:37,en,WEB,"  Everything is fast. Now life needs to be 5G, supercharged, and express. But your meals shouldn't be a sprint. In fact, slower eating might actually crank up your weight-management efforts. Try to think about the last time it took you 20 minutes or more to eat a meal. If it wasn't recently, you may be scarfing your food down too fast. That's because the 20 minute mark is important. Science shows that it takes 20 minutes for your brain to get the message you're full. Eating slower can help you feel full sooner. This eliminates the unintended, extra calories consumed after you're actually full—but don't know it. So, instead of spending a lot of time thinking about the right mix of macronutrients or counting calories, just take more time to eat. This simple approach is just one of your options, obviously. Dieters use hundreds of different methods to try and reduce food intake. But eating slower might be worth trying on its own, or in combination with the diet of your choice. Wondering if eating slower can really help you manage your weight? You aren't alone. Researchers around the world have taken quite an interest in the topic of slower eating. Let's see what they've found. And the Slower Eating Study Says … A lot of promising results have come out of all the research on eating slower and weight management. Some research has shown eating slower can help reduce food intake, which is great for weight-management. You don't have to seek out all the research yourself. A meta-analysis (a study of studies) published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition in 2014 did it for you. The study analyzed differences in eating rate and its influence on energy intake and hunger. Researchers analyzed and combined the evidence from 22 studies. They calculated the average differences in food intake between slow and fast eating, and the possible differences in hunger. The combined evidence showed that eating slower is associated with less calorie consumption than a faster eating rate. This was true regardless of the type of manipulation used to alter the eating rate. But how fast eating was done did not have an impact on hunger. This review supports the idea that the rate of eating does affect energy intake. Eating slower will help reduce food intake and limit excess consumption, regardless of the method used to slow down eating rate. You'll see some of those methods a little bit later. How Does Eating Slower Make You Lose Weight? Research on pace of eating has found correlations between lower body mass indexes and slower eating. That's exciting. But why does it happen? The lower calorie consumption for slower eaters is obviously a key part. Eating fewer calories is probably the most well-established weight-management advice. And you've already seen how eating slower ties to decreased caloric intake. You eat slower, you tend to eat less. That's mostly because you feel full before you overeat. Go back to the fun fact from earlier in the story. It takes 20 minutes for your brain to figure out if you're full or how full you really are. So, if you eat a meal's worth of food in 10 minutes and keep going for another five minutes, then you took in a lot of extra calories. But research suggests the links between eating slower and weight go deeper than the simple math of calories. The habit of inhaling food at a fast pace has established ties to metabolic issues. This revolves around how fast eaters' bodies react to food—including glucose tolerance issues and insulin resistance. These connections aren't surprising. Maintaining your metabolic health and staying at a healthy weight go hand in hand. And eating slower could help you keep your metabolism and fat burning churning normally, as well as help you eat fewer overall calories. That's a good combination for weight management...."

The 34-year-old actress took to her Instagram Stories on Friday, July 18, to share a beaming selfie with her 4-year-old son. In the heartwarming photo, Roberts could be seen sitting on a bench with her son as they flashed wide smiles. The American Horror Story actress wore a casual black shirt with matching sun glasses as she tied a white sweater around her neck. Meanwhile, Rhode, whom Roberts shares with her ex-partner Garrett Hedlund, rocked an orange shirt with black shorts, looking just like her famous mother. “My bestie,” the We're The Millers star sweetly captioned the photo. Back in February, Roberts shared peeks into her outing at an arcade with Rhode. The first photo showed Roberts laughing behind Rhodes, who appeared to be shouting while another featured the two faced the game with matching screaming faces. Emma Roberts and ex Garrett Hedlund welcomed their son Rhodes in December 2020. However, the couple parted their ways shortly after celebrating Rhodes' first birthday in 2022. Last year in July, the Scream actress announced her engagement with her partner of two years, Cody John, when she showed off the ring on Instagram, jokingly writing, ""putting this here before my mom tells everyone .”"

Nominator quote: “[Trevor] has the unique ability to deliver complex and sophisticated economic content in a way that is understandable and relatable. The recognition is evident in the economic keynote presentations he has already made at major conferences held by the Association of American Railroads (AAR), the Pacific Northwest Association of Rail Shippers (PNWARS), and at FTR Transportation Intelligence.” — Frank Adcock, TTX Co. Education: Undergraduate degree in economics and political science, University of Rhode Island; master's degree in economics, DePaul University. Job responsibilities: Help TTX navigate economic trends and understand the impact on freight activity; provide forecasting to drive TTX's business plan in service of Class I railroad ownership. Describe your career path. Toward the end of completing my master's in economics, I started working as an intern at the U.S. Treasury Department, doing forensic economic analysis on financial crime cases. After the internship and graduation, I was offered an economist role at AECOM, an infrastructure consulting firm, working in their sports and entertainment division. Following AECOM, I worked as an economist in the steel industry at ArcelorMittal USA, before their U.S.-based assets were purchased by Cleveland Cliffs. Next, I was approached by TTX to join their ranks. What sparked your interest in the rail industry? As an industrial economist, I have always enjoyed working across a variety of industries. In rail, you must be familiar with market trends across automotive, real estate, energy, consumer markets, manufacturing and global trade, which makes for an evolving and exciting workflow. What was your very first job and what did you learn from it? My first job was working at Subway. I learned how to make the perfect sandwich (even topping distribution is key) and how to wrap it up. I also learned the beauty of an assembly line and how to work well with people who have different backgrounds. What's something people might be surprised to learn about you? I am a drummer! I love to drum, and I am trying to teach my 2-year-old how to drum. What's one of the most valuable lessons you've learned so far in your career? Don't take things personally and always try to find what your organization might be missing or lacking, then aim to fill those gaps. How do you stay motivated and resilient when things get tough at work, in the rail industry or in life? I always try to stay grounded in reality and remain rational so that we keep our eyes fixed on the end goal and figure out the best way to get there with the resources we have, no matter how many roadblocks we face. If you could share a meal with anyone in the world today, who would it be and why? George Lucas, creator of Star Wars. I could talk to him about the vast universe of Star Wars and where he found the inspiration to create such a brilliant story with such rich detail. In your view, what is the rail industry's greatest challenge today? After reflecting on public statements [from] the railroads, I'd say that carload and intermodal volume growth are key challenges that we all should be focused on."

(WPRI) — The union representing workers at Rhode Island Hospital and Hasbro Children's Hospital voted Thursday to ratify a new, three-year agreement. United Nurses and Allied Professionals (UNAP), which represents nearly 2,500 health care workers, has been at the bargaining table since January with the hospitals' parent company, Brown University Health. After 30 bargaining sessions, the two groups agreed to a memorandum of understanding on July 3, according to Brown University Health. BACKGROUND: Union reaches tentative deal with RI Hospital The hospital group said it offered a ""market-competitive"" proposal which would include retroactive raises, step and COLA increases, enhanced differentials and benefits totaling $50 million over the next three years. The agreement replaces a seven-year contract that expired at the end of March. The last full negotiation had not happened since 2018. Sarah Frost, chief of hospital operations at Brown Health and president of Rhode Island and Hasbro Children's hospitals, expressed contentment with the ""fair and responsible"" resolution. ""This outcome reflects the dedication and hard work of both bargaining teams and reaffirms our shared commitment to supporting our caregivers, advancing patient care, and strengthening our hospital for the communities we serve,"" Frost said.

After years of anticipation, production is officially underway for Practical Magic 2, bringing back beloved stars Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock to reprise their roles as the Owens sisters. The news, confirmed by multiple sources including ABC News and Variety, has sent a wave of excitement through fans of the 1998 cult classic. Kidman herself shared a glimpse of the first day on set, posting a photo with Bullock and captioning it, “The witches are back!” This simple message, echoed across social media, confirms the long-awaited reunion of the dynamic duo. But what does this sequel hold for Sally and Gillian Owens? Will they continue to navigate love, loss, and the complexities of their magical heritage? And what new challenges will they face? The Legacy of 'Practical Magic' and the Path to a Sequel Practical Magic, based on the novel by Alice Hoffman, has maintained a devoted following for over two decades. Its blend of romance, comedy, and supernatural elements resonated with audiences, establishing itself as a Halloween staple. The original film's enduring appeal is a testament to its strong female leads and its exploration of themes like sisterhood, independence, and embracing one's true self. The decision to revisit this world comes after years of speculation and fan requests. The sequel isn't simply a nostalgic revisit, however. Deadline reports that six new actors have joined the cast, hinting at a broadened storyline and the introduction of fresh characters. While details remain scarce, the addition of new talent suggests the filmmakers are aiming to expand the universe of Practical Magic, potentially exploring new branches of the Owens family tree or introducing a new generation of witches. However, not all familiar faces will be returning. Evan Rachel Wood, who played Kylie Owens in the original film, has confirmed she was not asked to participate in the sequel, stating, “It was not in my control.” This news has disappointed some fans, but it underscores the creative decisions involved in bringing a new vision to the screen. Did You Know? Alice Hoffman, the author of the original novel, has continued to expand the world of the Owens sisters through a series of follow-up novels, providing a rich source of inspiration for the sequel's storyline. The return of Kidman and Bullock is undoubtedly the biggest draw for fans. Their chemistry and portrayal of the Owens sisters were central to the original film's success. Seeing them back together will evoke a strong sense of nostalgia and anticipation. But what kind of story will Practical Magic 2 tell? Will it lean into darker themes, explore the consequences of magic, or focus on the enduring power of family? As production progresses, more details are sure to emerge. One thing is certain: the witches are back, and the magic is about to begin anew. Will this sequel capture the same enchanting spirit as the original? Only time will tell. Frequently Asked Questions About 'Practical Magic 2' What is the release date for 'Practical Magic 2'? Currently, there is no confirmed release date for Practical Magic 2.

Learn more She might have built a beauty empire around her skincare, but there's another secret weapon that helps Hailey Bieber maintain her glowing skin. The Rhode founder is a known fan of the Medicube Age-R Booster Pro, which has different functions and promises to lift, firm and sculpt your face, as well as increase absorption of your skincare products. Touted as the number one best selling beauty gadget in Korea at the moment, its fan base also includes Kylie Jenner who, let's face it, is also known for her flawless complexion. Although it's usually priced at £265.22, Amazon has currently got it on sale for £189.50, saving you more than £75 on the handy device. Kylie Jenner has been wearing these platform flip flops on repeat on holiday This £8 hydrating body oil is the 'best repellant' for insects and mosquito bites As well as being a bit of a bargain right now, the tool also combines multiple features into one gadget, so you don't need to splurge on a tonne of different tools (or find the space for them). The Medicube Age-R Booster Pro has six different functions which improve your skin both inside and out, from improving elasticity and reducing pore size to tightening up the skin and reducing inflammation. The six functions are: Electroporation (which creates temporary pathways between your skin cells, improving how effectively your skincare products absorb) Microcurrent EMS Microneedling LED Sonic vibration Considering there are tools designed to do pretty much all of these individually, it's no surprise that one that does them all has proven so popular. If it's still a little too pricey for you, there are other options which may not offer as many functions, but still combine some of the most sought-after treatments in one. The Magnitone FaceRocket 5-in-1 Facial Firming and Toning Device sculpts, smooths and depuffs your skin, and offers five different functions to boost its appearance and feel. You can use it for radiofrequency, microcurrent, LED light therapy, cryotherapy and sonic massage, all for the price tag of £149.99. If you want something ultra budget-friendly, the Stylpro Fabulous Firmer Neck and Face Smoother is just £29.99. It offers a choice of three LED colours, heat and vibration depending on which settings you choose, all of which help de-puff, firm and decongest skin, whilst tackling things like fine lines and pigmentation. However the Medicube Age-R Booster Pro seems to have not only been a big hit with A-listers like Hailey and Kylie – it's also racked up an impressive rating from Amazon shoppers, too. One reviewer wrote: “Face lifting and reducing the wrinkles are immediate results. Kinda unbelievable but it really works! Love it!” Whilst another agreed: “Fabulous device, I've noticed an improvement in my skin,I especially love the micro needling mode but start low and slow as it packs a punch!! I've noticed my pores are a lot less noticeable, my fine lines have improved a lot too. The device did give me some problems but the seller was very helpful and asked me to post it for repair which ended up being a full replacement of the device! Highly recommend this seller very responsive and helpful in resolving the problem.” Others found it less effective, however, with one shopper saying: “It's alright. If you don't have it you're not missing out on anything. I have been using it on and off for 3 months no visible difference. I would return it if I can get my money back.” Another added: “Decent device with some benefits like improved absorption and radiance, but results are subtle. LED anti-wrinkle effect is minimal. Pore care works okay. Build quality is good, but expected better for the price. Average performance overall.” Others, however, felt the Medicube Age-R Booster Pro made an almost instant difference to their skin, with someone else saying: “After using the Booster Pro Skin Therapy Device for just a week, I'm already seeing fantastic results!

Story seems pretty straightforward - Bunny girl Amiya is leading her Rhode Island operators to infiltrate the city that's crashing into Lungmen. If they succeed, there will not be an all-out war. One of those operators is the artificially infected girl Rosmontis, who is pretty powerful but forgetful (maybe intentionally so). Amiya wants to talk to whoever is running the show on the moving city, so she leads everyone to bash a path through to some ritual. That moving city is supposed to be led by fire lord ~~Ozai~~ Talulah, but it seems from this episode she's trying to break down Reunion, the rebel group that loves anarchy. She gave some ""key"" to Patriot, who's supposed to be the only pure-blood Wendigo (?) , and supposed to be very powerful because of *reasons*. We see Patriot at that ritual. Will we see how that ""key"" is used? Tune in next episode."

mov_477A72F5B8A2B2F5C845A85DC71088A1,2025-07-19 05:21:57,en,WEB,"  Pope Leo XIV has officially declared his first miracle as pontiff, crediting the 2007 recovery of a dying newborn in Rhode Island to divine intervention following a physician's desperate prayer. The Vatican announced this week that the ailing child, Tyquan Hall, who was born prematurely via emergency cesarean section and left with no detectable pulse, made a full recovery after a doctor invoked the name of a long-forgotten 19th-century Spanish priest. The declaration elevates not just a miraculous story of life snatched from the jaws of death but also the potential sainthood of the humble cleric whose name was called in a moment of need. 'We are thrilled that this recognition will move the cause of beatification and canonization forward for Venerable Servant of God Salvador Valera Parra,' said Rev. Timothy Reilly of the Diocese of Providence, calling the papal pronouncement a blessing for Rhode Island and beyond. The miracle marks the first to be authenticated under Pope Leo XIV, the newly elected American pontiff, and it may set in motion the canonization of Father Valera Parra, a priest who died in Spain in 1889 and had no known miracles to his name, until now. According to the Diocese of Almeria, Dr. Juan Sanchez, a Spanish-born physician working in a Rhode Island hospital in 2007, found himself verging on despair. Baby Tyquan had been born in critical condition - pale, turning blue and without a heartbeat, suffering from oxygen deprivation so severe that death, or permanent brain damage, seemed all but certain. With no medical options left, Sanchez offered a prayer, not to a modern saint or well-known figure, but to Valera Parra, the patron of his hometown of Huércal-Overa in southeastern Spain. What happened next, according to hospital staff and the Vatican, was immediate and inexplicable. 'A few minutes after the faithful prayer, the child's heart began to beat normally without medical intervention,' reported WJAR-TV. Doctors braced for the child to have severe neurological damage, but Tyquan defied every expectation. He spoke at 18 months, walked at two years, and today, shows no sign of impairment - a living testament, the Vatican says, to the power of faith. The miracle is especially striking because Valera Parra had never visited the United States, let alone New England. 'The cool thing is, the more you think about the miracle itself, Father Valera lived in the 19th century. He never came to the U.S. Never came to Rhode Island,' Rev. Reilly noted. 'And yet… the doctor called out and called upon his name… he decided to intervene.' Born in 1816 and known as a simple diocesan priest, Valera Parra died in 1889 without fame, controversy, or claims of supernatural gifts. But the miracle attributed to his name now places him squarely on the path to sainthood, requiring only one more confirmed miracle for canonization. The miracle declaration also makes history for Pope Leo XIV, the first American and first Peruvian citizen to lead the global Church. Born Robert Prevost in Chicago, Leo, 69, was elected pope on May 8, following the death of Pope Francis. A former missionary in Peru, he later oversaw the Vatican's powerful office of bishops before ascending to the papacy. Known for his calm intellect, deep spirituality, and surprising relatability, Leo is as comfortable quoting Scripture as he is solving Wordle puzzles with his brother back in Illinois. He's also a White Sox fan and has also said he's not giving up playing tennis anytime soon. This week's announcement also signals Leo XIV's broader vision for sainthood in the modern era. Alongside Valera Parra's miracle, the Vatican is advancing the cause of Carlos Acutis, a British-born Millennial teen who died of leukemia in 2007 and whose body remains incorrupt in a glass tomb in Assisi, Italy. Carlos, known for creating a website cataloging Eucharistic miracles, is on track to become the first Millennial saint."

mov_C51F7BD90CFFA3B41A9B36434CA10BCB,2025-07-19 06:00:00,en,WEB,"  ""I just wanna be a hot dad"" Last month, Rhode's new ""cover girl"" elicited a gasp in the Marie Claire office. Forget the women of the moment, Hailey Bieber's beauty brand tapped this year's hottest straight, male actor: Harris Dickinson, of Babygirl fame, to promote her new Glazing Mist. ""WHY WOULD A MAN BE THERE! [sic]"", wrote one Reddit user in response to the campaign on the forum ""LAinfluencersnark"", while another added, ""What does this have to do with skincare or make-up?"" Initially, yes, it raised an eyebrow coming from Rhode's strain of “clean girl” beauty, which is famed for birthing frivolous foodstuff-related trends, like 'glazed doughnut nails', 'latte make-up' and 'strawberry girl blush'. But really, tapping Hollywood in this way makes perfect sense for a brand that has always been ahead of the curve, as their recent $1 billion acquisition from e.l.f. Beauty proves. So, I wondered, was Rhode onto something more? Does Dickinson's appointment signal his demographic's growing interest in the industry? Mentally scanning my friendship group, I can see a real shift. Dipping a toe in beauty was once by way of brands like Bulldog, who strived to ""toughen"" up moisturiser so men and boys would actually use it—now, it's a rapidly growing market. Data from a recent YouGov BrandIndex shows that in the past four years, the skincare and cosmetics sector in Britain has grown exponentially amongst young men, aged 18-34, with 65 per cent of this cohort saying that looking physically attractive is important to them. You may like Indeed, one scan of the popular social satire Instagram accounts Socks House Meeting and Real Housewives of Clapton shows that the elevated man of today prizes his Malin+Goetz Peppermint Shampoo, Aesop Parsley Seed Cleanser and Haeckles Eco Marine Cream just as much as his Salomon trainers and the carabiner he hangs off his denim jorts. And even if the majority of men are not engaging in Patrick Bateman-level multi-step routines, they're making considered purchases, based on real research. When I ask London-based filmmaker Philip, 35, if he has had a growing interest in beauty, he replies, “Massively so. If anything, I have a suspicion of traditional men's grooming brands, unless it's high-end like Kiehl's—I rely more on what my girlfriend uses and recommends. It's not so much my age, it's growing awareness. I wish I had started putting effort in far earlier. I just want to age gracefully, and the big change has been understanding SPF. I don't want to damage my skin.” A friend who works in music PR, Henry, 29, tells me that his current skincare routine came from social media and getting closer to 30. “The algorithm is pushing a gym bro aesthetic that is relentless. My discover page is filled with hyper-masculine features and low body fat percentage, and I feel like I barely even interact.” He now buys curl creme and always keeps a “healthy stock” of The INKEY List moisturiser, caffeine eye cream, retinol and a tea tree face wash. “I have started [buying more beauty products in the past two years], mostly through word of mouth recommendations from female and male friends. Now that I'm almost pushing 30, I feel more of a need to take care of myself and my looks than ever, bizarrely. I think I just wanna be a hot dad.” For Philip and Henry, this shift has translated into regularly purchasing a few targeted skincare solutions to optimise or slow down age-related concerns, but other men are taking a different approach. Dr Tony Kaliya, the award-winning founder and medical director of the NEU Clinic (who is the expert behind my own Polynucleotide treatments), says there's been a definite uptick in straight men seeking cosmetic procedures, and that it increases year on year.

By submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over. “What was once considered a female-dominated space is becoming far more gender-inclusive—men currently make up around 20–30% of my client base. Most are professionals aged between 30 and 55, although I've seen a rise in younger men coming in for preventative treatments. Once male patients start cosmetic treatments, almost all of them continue having more once they see the results.” Fellow aesthetics doctor and NHS GP, Dr Ahmed El Muntasar, agrees, saying that there's been a four hundred per cent increase in (mostly) straight men coming into his clinic for treatments. “Several factors contribute to this shift,” Dr Kaliya tells me. “Social media has played a huge role in normalising aesthetic treatments for men, and especially masculinising treatments such as chin and jawline filler. Increased visibility of male celebrities and influencers undergoing treatments has also helped break the stigma. And interestingly, the rise of high-definition Zoom calls during the pandemic made men more aware of their facial appearance, particularly lines and wrinkles, increasing the number seeking anti-wrinkle treatments such as Botox. There's also a growing cultural emphasis on optimisation—looking good is increasingly seen as part of performing well both professionally and socially.” And while the aesthetics doctor concedes that men have not faced the same scrutiny as women regarding appearance, the gap is closing, especially in competitive industries or highly visible roles. ""Men are expected to look youthful, energetic and well-groomed, and the ideal aesthetic has shifted too: strong jawlines, clear skin and well-balanced features are increasingly desirable. Most male clients aren't looking to look 'done' — they want to look like a more refreshed, well-rested version of themselves. Many are aiming to stay competitive in the workplace or dating scene without it being obvious."" As such, the most popular treatments amongst men, Dr El Muntasar explains, are collagen-stimulating treatments like Polynucleotides and JULAINE, dermal fillers for the under eyes, and Botox for fine lines and wrinkles. But ultimately, just as the beauty standard for women has grown exponentially since the advent of social media, it's having an effect on men too. Antonio, a photographer in his 30s, started getting Botox a few years ago, on top of overhauling his skincare routine to include SPF moisturiser, body oil and eye retinol. “I want to look a certain way to please myself in front of the mirror,"" he tells me.

mov_D0DADA8BE5C30BDAC3319BDDF343F9AD,2025-07-19 06:45:30,en,WEB,"  Pope Leo XIV has officially declared his first miracle as pontiff, crediting the 2007 recovery of a dying newborn in Rhode Island to divine intervention following a physician's desperate prayer. The Vatican announced this week that the ailing child, Tyquan Hall, who was born prematurely via emergency cesarean section and left with no detectable pulse, made a full recovery after a doctor invoked the name of a long-forgotten 19th-century Spanish priest. The declaration elevates not just a miraculous story of life snatched from the jaws of death but also the potential sainthood of the humble cleric whose name was called in a moment of need. 'We are thrilled that this recognition will move the cause of beatification and canonization forward for Venerable Servant of God Salvador Valera Parra,' said Rev. Timothy Reilly of the Diocese of Providence, calling the papal pronouncement a blessing for Rhode Island and beyond. The miracle marks the first to be authenticated under Pope Leo XIV, the newly elected American pontiff, and it may set in motion the canonization of Father Valera Parra, a priest who died in Spain in 1889 and had no known miracles to his name, until now. According to the Diocese of Almeria, Dr. Juan Sanchez, a Spanish-born physician working in a Rhode Island hospital in 2007, found himself verging on despair. Baby Tyquan had been born in critical condition – pale, turning blue and without a heartbeat, suffering from oxygen deprivation so severe that death, or permanent brain damage, seemed all but certain. With no medical options left, Sanchez offered a prayer, not to a modern saint or well-known figure, but to Valera Parra, the patron of his hometown of Huércal-Overa in southeastern Spain. Pope Leo XIV has officially declared his first miracle as pontiff, crediting the 2007 recovery of a dying newborn in Rhode Island to divine intervention following a physician's desperate prayer According to the Diocese of Almeria, Dr. Juan Sanchez, a Spanish-born physician working in a Rhode Island hospital in 2007, found himself verging on despair when he prayed to Valera Parra, the patron of his hometown Father Valera Parra, a priest who died in Spain in 1889 and had no known miracles to his name, until now What happened next, according to hospital staff and the Vatican, was immediate and inexplicable. 'A few minutes after the faithful prayer, the child's heart began to beat normally without medical intervention,' reported WJAR-TV. Doctors braced for the child to have severe neurological damage, but Tyquan defied every expectation. He spoke at 18 months, walked at two years, and today, shows no sign of impairment – a living testament, the Vatican says, to the power of faith. The miracle is especially striking because Valera Parra had never visited the United States, let alone New England. 'The cool thing is, the more you think about the miracle itself, Father Valera lived in the 19th century. He never came to the U.S. Never came to Rhode Island,' Rev. Reilly noted. 'And yet… the doctor called out and called upon his name… he decided to intervene.' The miracle declaration also makes history for Pope Leo XIV, the first American and first Peruvian citizen to lead the global Church Pope Leo XIV greets the faithful as he leaves the church of St. Thomas of Villanova where he celebrated a Mass, at his summer residence in Castel Gandolfo, Italy, earlier this week Born in 1816 and known as a simple diocesan priest, Valera Parra died in 1889 without fame, controversy, or claims of supernatural gifts. But the miracle attributed to his name now places him squarely on the path to sainthood, requiring only one more confirmed miracle for canonization. The miracle declaration also makes history for Pope Leo XIV, the first American and first Peruvian citizen to lead the global Church. Born Robert Prevost in Chicago, Leo, 69, was elected pope on May 8, following the death of Pope Francis. A former missionary in Peru, he later oversaw the Vatican's powerful office of bishops before ascending to the papacy. When he has the time, the pope picks up a tennis racquet. Pictured, Italian tennis player Jannik Sinner gave a tennis racket to Pope Leo XIV in Vatican City, in May Pope Leo XIV was seen wearing a Chicago White Sox baseball team cap last month as he mets newly wedded couples in St Peter's Square at the Vatican Pope Leo, seen center, is as comfortable quoting Scripture as he is solving Wordle puzzles with his brothers, Louise, left, and John, right, back in Illinois Known for his calm intellect, deep spirituality, and surprising relatability, Leo is as comfortable quoting Scripture as he is solving Wordle puzzles with his brother back in Illinois. He's also a White Sox fan and has also said he's not giving up playing tennis anytime soon. This week's announcement also signals Leo XIV's broader vision for sainthood in the modern era. Alongside Valera Parra's miracle, the Vatican is advancing the cause of Carlos Acutis, a British-born Millennial teen who died of leukemia in 2007 and whose body remains incorrupt in a glass tomb in Assisi, Italy. Carlos, known for creating a website cataloging Eucharistic miracles, is on track to become the first Millennial saint."

mov_9DA69701F21B4EE9AC37DAB1FAFA4CE2,2025-07-19 08:02:17,en,WEB,"  LOS ANGELES, July 19 — Hailey Bieber isn't letting her billion-dollar business success get caught up in husband Justin Bieber's old business drama. The model and entrepreneur clapped back at claims that the money she made from selling her skincare brand Rhode to e.l.f. Beauty had anything to do with her husband's financial dealings with former manager Scooter Braun. “The historic sale of Rhode is a huge accomplishment for Hailey and is completely separate from her husband and his business affairs,” her rep told Us Weekly yesterday. That statement came a day after TMZ reported Justin was allegedly holding off on paying back Braun's company, Hybe, until Hailey's massive Rhode deal went through. According to Us Weekly, the beauty brand sale, finalised in May, is worth up to US$1 billion (RM4.25 billion) —including US$600 million in cash, US$200 million in shares, and a potential US$200 million bonus if the brand meets certain targets. Hailey, 28, is still involved as chief creative officer and head of innovation. As for Justin, 31, he's said to have reached a US$31.5 million settlement with Braun for unpaid commissions and an advance tied to his cancelled Justice tour in 2022. He has yet to address the reports publicly. Braun and Justin officially ended their professional relationship in August 2023 after years of working together. Reflecting on the split during a June episode of the Diary of a CEO podcast, Braun, 44, said, “I understand, he probably wants to go on and show that he can do it. We worked together for so long and we had such extreme success... I think at this point that's what he's doing.” Justin, meanwhile, has kept a relatively low profile — until recently. Earlier this month, he surprise-released Swag, his first album in four years. The 21-track drop is more of a side project, according to Us Weekly, with a full-fledged pop record planned for early 2026. Even Braun gave the unexpected release his blessing, writing in an Instagram Story: “This is, without a doubt, the most authentically Justin Bieber album to date.” Despite the speculation and swirling headlines, Hailey's making it clear: her billion-dollar glow-up is all her own."

mov_0C9725B4430CFF2CF1278E2C64FB2680,2025-07-19 09:00:42,en,WEB,"  This summer,  is excited to welcome Avery Hill to the newsroom as a sports intern. A resident of Maryland, Avery started on June 16 and will be a full-time presence in our newsroom and on the fields of Rhode Island through mid-August, when he will head back to  to continue his academic career. We talked with Avery about his early experiences in journalism and how he hopes to grow in the profession. Why are you interested in journalism? What topics are you most interested in? I'm interested in journalism because I have a passion for telling and uncovering unique stories. Growing up, I've always had the chance to see so many unique stories told not just in the sports or journalism realm, but in the entire world. I became interested in journalism specifically because I noticed my writing abilities in the English classes that I dreaded most. Playing sports and being a sports nerd in high school, I put the two together. I am most interested in sports journalism, specifically in long-form and enterprise pieces. Still, I've had experience covering the culture and identity beat at my school, and I've grown to love all forms of journalism. What are you hoping to get out of your internship with The Providence Journal? I am hoping to grow as a writer and challenge myself to seek out stories that I'm unfamiliar with. Covering sports in summer sports is a challenge in itself, as there aren't many teams playing. If I can find a great story during the summer, I can find one anywhere – especially given the fact that I didn't grow up in or near Rhode Island. I also would like to pick the brains of colleagues and editors to gain knowledge from their perspectives. Getting the chance to write for a publication like The Providence Journal is an incredible opportunity, and I'm excited to see how I progress this summer. Tell us about some of your favorite journalism-related experiences from Penn State University. My favorite journalism-related experience from Penn State has to be my time covering Penn State football during the 2024 season with The Daily Collegian. I was a reporter and got the chance to cross many states off my bucket list, including attending the Big Ten Championship in Indianapolis, the Fiesta Bowl in Arizona and the Orange Bowl in Miami. Each trip was a chance for me to not just experience new things, but to challenge myself to get better at every turn, with a grueling 16-game season that stripped me from my winter break. The pressure of capturing every moment and fighting through adversity allowed me to push myself, and I'm very proud of my work. Additionally, I enjoy my time with the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) at Penn State, where we attend yearly conferences and I serve as the chapter president. What are some things you want readers to know about you? What I would like readers to know about me is that I am very passionate about pushing myself to the fullest extent. My drive has assisted me in my various endeavors, and I do my best to evaluate myself constantly to ensure that. As I go through this summer, I am looking for any and all feedback that will help me along the way. I think that connecting with readers is important, as I attempt to learn something new every day. I hope all of you are able to enjoy the work I put forth this summer."
mov_90C2DF223768657D702A4C995D6D4C3F,2025-07-19 09:04:55,en,WEB,"  Recently, some friends invited Maggie Miller to bring her kids to a trampoline park for a play date. Another friend invited her and her husband out for dinner. Miller wanted to go to both events, but said no. She's trying to save money. Her family is participating in No Buy July, a growing trend on social media that encourages consumers to only buy the necessities and refrain from buying what is not needed. Those who are participating say it is a good challenge and a way to save. Financial experts say the exercise of purposefully controlling your spending is a good one with several benefits. What is No Buy July? No Buy July may have varying rules based on who is doing it, but essentially the challenge allows you to continue to spend on the items you need: food, gas, bills that need to be paid, home and unexpected medical expenses. But the discretionary items or trips to the store, or extra online shopping are off-limits, as are spending money on eating out. Or at least that's the goal. Some people say they have been successful at not buying extras and others say they've had ""slip ups."" No Buy July offers a pause on purchases Miller, who lives in Gilbert, Arizona with her husband and two young kids, has done no-spend weeks before. But No Buy July came at the right time, she said. ""I was like 'Oh, that's catchy. I like it. And we had just a really spendy June,"" said Miller, explaining that her husband had been invited on a once-in-a-lifetime, last-minute trip and she had a baby shower that required travel. Their daughter's birthday – and birthday party – was also in June. Participating in No Buy July is a way to ""force yourself to just press pause on purchases and ask 'Do we really need this?'"" Miller told USA TODAY. ""It really helps at the end of the month to look back or as you're going through the month to see 'Where are my spending habits? Where am I triggered to spend?' "" Miller has been sharing her No Buy July experience on her Instagram account, MoneySavingMotherhood. She started the account about a year ago and said as a working mom with a family, she shares real-life tips for budgeting and saving money. Frugal mom has wins and losses Miller said because she is frugal and is not ""constantly spending all the time,"" the No Buy July experience has not been too painful. But there have been moments, like when her girlfriend texted to ask if Miller and the kids wanted to go to a trampoline park, that it got a bit difficult. It was 115 degrees in Arizona and Miller said the thought of a fun activity in air conditioning was tempting. It was also hard to turn down a dinner invitation, she said. ""It's hard to say no, but I think it's a good exercise to practice,"" she said. On her Instagram post for her second week of the challenge, Miller outlined her expenses: Regular bills: $291.88 (That also included $21.65 for subscriptions like streaming services, which Miller said doesn't make sense to cancel for a month and restart). Unexpected expenses: $696.74 (their garage door broke and cost $500 and they needed their palm trees trimmed and new sprinklers for $96.74). Miscellaneous household expenses: $72.46 (This included buying household staples like laundry detergent and sunscreen to get good deals during Amazon Prime Days. But she refrained from extra purchases, Miller said). Unnecessary: $60.14 (Miller said this is where she theoretically ""messed up"" by and buying a few dresses. ""It was completely unnecessary,"" she said. ""I'm going to Hawaii for my 10-year anniversary in September and they were so cute."" Be kind to yourself; ""mess ups"" are OK Miller said though she considers the thrift trip and purchase a ""mess up,"" she won't give up on No Buy July, and encourages others to do the same if they encounter a setback. Miller said it should still be OK to forgive yourself and continue on. Even though she has an Instagram page about frugal living and budgeting, ""I'm just as susceptible to treating myself to something,"" she said, adding that she tells herself, "" 'Yeah, it was unnecessary but I did it and we're going to move on.' "" Miller is vowing not to tempt herself by going near any thrift stores for the remainder of the challenge. ""I know that's my pitfall,"" she said. Financial planners like No Buy July concept Kelly Renner, a certified financial planner in Augusta, Georgia, had not heard of No Buy July, but loves the concept and has encouraged clients to do similar exercises once in a while. ""When you pay attention to your spending, you spend less. Even those who followed a budget and maybe just fell off, it is a good reset to do a challenge,"" Renner told USA TODAY. She'll also have spouses challenge each other to see who can save the most during a challenge...."

Unfortunately, he left on a sour note after the hotel charged him a $500 smoking fee following his stay. The problem? Griff says he's never smoked a day in his life, let alone in a hotel room while staying there with his family. Griff, a senior reporter at The Points Guy, took his story public on social media after the hotel allegedly charged him the $500 fee based on readings from an air quality sensor. The sensor data was supplied by a third-party company called Rest, which claims hotels can easily collect fees from smoking events."

In Untamed, a new Netflix series starring Eric Bana, a special agent for the National Park Service Investigative Services Branch (ISB), tries to answer that question after a body is discovered in Yosemite National Park. This limited series, which is currently the most popular show on Netflix, combines a stunning setting with character-driven drama and a gripping mystery. Watch With Us breaks down the reasons you shouldn't miss Untamed on Netflix. The Setting Is Breathtaking [embedded content] Untamed wasn't actually filmed at Yellowstone — instead, it was mostly shot in Canada. However, the verdant hills of British Columbia do a stunning job of standing in for the national park that Bana's character, Kyle Turner, mentions is “the size of Rhode Island.” Between stunning aerial shots of the real Yellowstone and the composite locations used to approximate the park on the ground, Untamed creates an immersive and beautiful world for Turner and park rangers Paul Souter (Sam Neill) and Naya Vazquez (Lily Santiago) to explore. The Mystery Pulls You In A rock climber over water in 'Untamed' Netflix The body of a Jane Doe is discovered in the most jarring way possible — two mountain climbers see her fall over the edge of a cliff as they're scaling the rock face. The body nearly knocks them down themselves. When Turner enters the case, he's quickly able to determine that the woman was dead before her fall — meaning there's a serious mystery to unravel here. The story integrates all sorts of elements from the park into the mystery itself — Indigenous practices that bear similarities to some Jane Doe's identifying marks, past Yellowstone cases that bear striking similarities and still haunt Turner and the sheer size of the terrain, which makes it disturbingly easy for people to go missing. The twists and turns of the investigation are genuinely unexpected. Want personalized streaming recommendations? Tell us your favorite services below, and we'll send you our newsletter. (Select all that apply.) It Features a Partner Dynamic That Really Works Eric Bana and Lily Santiago in 'Untamed' Netflix As Ranger Vazquez, Lily Santiago does an admirable job of portraying the newer ranger's eagerness to learn from Turner despite his rough and brooding demeanor. She becomes a de facto partner to the ISB investigator, and watching their relationship unfold is one of the true pleasures of the show. Alongside Vazquez, we learn about a tragic incident from Turner's past that shattered his marriage to Jill (Rosemarie DeWitt), which has a significant impact on their Jane Doe investigation. His nearly obsessive fixation on finding justice feels truly motivated, rather than him just playing into the “brooding cop with a dark past” stereotype. Though a “grizzled older cop with an idealistic rookie” is also a familiar trope, Vazquez and Turner's dynamic doesn't feel rote. Instead, their relationship feels refreshing, especially since Vazquez is also hiding secrets of her own. It's a Quick Binge with a Satisfying Ending Eric Bana in 'Untamed' Netflix This may sound like a backhanded compliment, but it's true — at only 6 episodes, Untamed is a show you can get through in a weekend. Surprisingly, it moves at a fast clip without leaving too many loose ends. Without giving any spoilers, the show pays off the central mystery in a satisfying way. If you're looking for a mystery thriller that will pull you in and tie everything up by the finale, Untamed is that show — which makes it a great watch. Stream all of Untamed on Netflix now.

In February 2025, TNA Wrestling announced that Silva had taken over as president of the company. Normally when a new boss comes in, they are trying to reinvigorate the business, bringing a flair that will drive success. But Silva joined with TNA in the midst of its best run since the promotion's early days. A partnership with WWE, a WrestleMania moment, well-respected veterans and rising stars on the roster have boosted the brand's popularity. The continuous ride is heading toward the company's anniversary – Slammiversary 2025, taking place July 20 at UBS Arena on Long Island. There, seven matches will take place that showcase the best of TNA's roster, with some WWE stars also in the fold. TNA has spent so much time building toward this moment, and believes it will be another critical point in elevating the brand. “This six-month build is going to have a nice crescendo, and just be a high point for the year, and then launch us into 2026 off of this high point,” Silva told USA TODAY Sports. What's made TNA Wrestling successful? Just looking at TNA itself, there's no denying the amount of talent on the roster. There's legends like Jeff and Matt Hardy still rocking, as well as established veterans in Nic Nemeth, Moose, Frankie Kazarian and the recently signed Indi Hartwell, to name a few. There's young stars like KC Navarro and Leon Slater, who have championship opportunities in front of them. And, of course, arguably the hottest stars in Joe Hendry and Mike Santana, who will compete for the TNA World Championship against current title-holder Trick Williams of NXT. It's the blend of well-known wrestlers and up-and-coming talent that makes TNA an intriguing product, Silva believes. “We can develop talent that wants to come through the indies and then come into the major leagues with TNA, but yet we can also reinvigorate and give more life to talent that's maybe on the other end of their career,” Silva said. “I think we can provide both the entry and the build of the excitement, as well as let the fans really enjoy these amazing legends that we've got.” The success of the WWE partnership It was Jan. 27, 2024 and Jordynne Grace knew the pressure was on her. She was going to be the surprise entrant in the women's Royal Rumble match, and as the TNA Knockouts World Champion, would be setting the tone for a potential partnership between the two brands. “I kind of knew, this was me opening the door, and if I did well, it could carry on and continue to do well,” Grace said. “But if I did bad and kind of like, it was blah, maybe it wouldn't.” But Grace knocked it out of the park. It was a success, and it kick-started the deal between WWE and TNA. After informally beginning in 2024, the two sides made their partnership official in January with a multi-year deal. Stars like Hendry have given Grace credit for making the partnership possible, and it also catapulted her career. She finished her time in TNA in January and she immediately signed with WWE full-time after several appearances with the brand. Now, she's in NXT and had a match at Evolution. She'll soon be in WWE 2K25, a “surreal” moment for “The Juggernaut.” Even though she's moved companies, she loves seeing TNA thrive. “I'm just so happy that we're continuing to work and put a spotlight on TNA, because they absolutely deserve it. The wrestlers in there are some of the best in the world, and they haven't been getting enough eyes on them in the past decade or so,” she said. “It's a special partnership, and I'm glad to have been the one to help create it.” Grace is just one example of how far talent can now go after the deal. There's no better example than Hendry. Thanks to his viral entrance song, Hendry elevated himself into a massively popular star. It led to him being in the 2025 Royal Rumble, and breaking barriers with a match at WrestleMania 41 as the TNA World Champion. Silva called the iconic moment the top one for TNA in the past year. Silva admitted there was some skepticism over whether the deal would benefit TNA and its stars, and the uncertainty lasted for a while. But now with proven results, both sides have fully bought in. “I get a lot of smiles from the talent on their roster when they come to visit us, and we get a lot of excitement at getting into a bigger arena and being on a big (WWE) stage,” Silva said. “I think everyone's enjoying working with each other and creating some great stories for the fans. “So far, so good. I got no complaints.” TNA Wrestling readies for massive Slammiversary 2025 WWE will be at the forefront of Slammiversary with Williams currently the TNA champion. He shockingly won the title in May, and it took Silva some time to get used to seeing talent from a different company at the top of his. But Silva said Williams has been a great representative for both sides, drawing plenty of intrigue over how the reign will unfold. For Williams himself, it's brought out an extra layer of confidence in someone that already exudes it. He said “success changes you,” and doing something historic – being a WWE star and holding another company's title – isn't lost on him...."

2eea9cb5d24f611eabd9e4c207fc363a,2025-07-19 12:21:00,en,WEB,"  Pope Leo XIV has officially declared his first miracle as pontiff, crediting the 2007 recovery of a dying newborn in Rhode Island to divine intervention following a physician's desperate prayer. The Vatican announced this week that the ailing child, Tyquan Hall, who was born prematurely via emergency cesarean section and left with no detectable pulse, made a full recovery after a doctor invoked the name of a long-forgotten 19th-century Spanish priest. The declaration elevates not just a miraculous story of life snatched from the jaws of death but also the potential sainthood of the humble cleric whose name was called in a moment of need. ' We are thrilled that this recognition will move the cause of beatification and canonization forward for Venerable Servant of God Salvador Valera Parra,' said Rev. Timothy Reilly of the Diocese of Providence, calling the papal pronouncement a blessing for Rhode Island and beyond. The miracle marks the first to be authenticated under Pope Leo XIV, the newly elected American pontiff, and it may set in motion the canonization of Father Valera Parra, a priest who died in Spain in 1889 and had no known miracles to his name, until now. According to the Diocese of Almeria, Dr. Juan Sanchez, a Spanish-born physician working in a Rhode Island hospital in 2007, found himself verging on despair. Baby Tyquan had been born in critical condition – pale, turning blue and without a heartbeat, suffering from oxygen deprivation so severe that death, or permanent brain damage, seemed all but certain. With no medical options left, Sanchez offered a prayer, not to a modern saint or well-known figure, but to Valera Parra, the patron of his hometown of Huércal-Overa in southeastern Spain. What happened next, according to hospital staff and the Vatican, was immediate and inexplicable. ' A few minutes after the faithful prayer, the child's heart began to beat normally without medical intervention,' reported WJAR-TV. Doctors braced for the child to have severe neurological damage, but Tyquan defied every expectation. He spoke at 18 months, walked at two years, and today, shows no sign of impairment – a living testament, the Vatican says, to the power of faith. The miracle is especially striking because Valera Parra had never visited the United States, let alone New England. ' The cool thing is, the more you think about the miracle itself, Father Valera lived in the 19th century. He never came to the U.S. Never came to Rhode Island,' Rev. Reilly noted. ' And yet… the doctor called out and called upon his name… he decided to intervene.' Born in 1816 and known as a simple diocesan priest, Valera Parra died in 1889 without fame, controversy, or claims of supernatural gifts. But the miracle attributed to his name now places him squarely on the path to sainthood, requiring only one more confirmed miracle for canonization. The miracle declaration also makes history for Pope Leo XIV, the first American and first Peruvian citizen to lead the global Church. Born Robert Prevost in Chicago, Leo, 69, was elected pope on May 8, following the death of Pope Francis. A former missionary in Peru, he later oversaw the Vatican's powerful office of bishops before ascending to the papacy. Known for his calm intellect, deep spirituality, and surprising relatability, Leo is as comfortable quoting Scripture as he is solving Wordle puzzles with his brother back in Illinois. He's also a White Sox fan and has also said he's not giving up playing tennis anytime soon. This week's announcement also signals Leo XIV's broader vision for sainthood in the modern era. Alongside Valera Parra's miracle, the Vatican is advancing the cause of Carlos Acutis, a British-born Millennial teen who died of leukemia in 2007 and whose body remains incorrupt in a glass tomb in Assisi, Italy. Carlos, known for creating a website cataloging Eucharistic miracles, is on track to become the first Millennial saint."

mov_D5FA42C21F2A611F671BCE5842BB97DE,2025-07-19 13:40:25,en,WEB,"  Opinion By Salam Fatohi IMG iStock-942826332 Skepticism and statistics go hand-in-hand when reading breaking news from the medical community about firearm regulations. Like mainstream media, the medical community typically leans far left on guns. One example of this problematic partnership was on display when a study was released in 2022 suggesting that firearms had taken over as the “leading cause of death among children” in the United States. Not only did NSSF  take apart the flawed study , even The Washington Post's Glenn Kessler  deconstructed and fact-checked  how the data was cut and manipulated in order to arrive at the conclusion, often repeated by former President Joe Biden, Biden administration officials, gun control activists and media across the country. Jumping back to the present, a more recent article published in June 2025 in JAMA (the Journal for American Medical Association) Pediatrics,  Firearm Laws and Pediatric Mortality in the US , examined adolescent firearm mortality after the 2010 McDonald v. Chicago case, which challenged Chicago's  handgun ban . This study investigated the data and trends to arrive at the claim that restricting legal firearm access had resulted in less adolescent firearm fatalities. Needless to say, at face value the findings are troubling. A closer look at the data underlying the study reveals it is  just more gun control propaganda masquerading as public health literature. Leading Cause and Questionable Statistics The study opens with the often repeated and misleading claim that firearms are the leading cause of death for children in the United States. As mentioned, this false claim was debunked by  The Washington Post  which showed that firearms were not the leading cause of death for American children. Older teens, 15-17 years old, are the most susceptible, predominantly for Black teens. That population is at high risk for  violence-related disparities . The authors of this JAMA study came up with a bold and striking  claim : “That permissive firearm laws contributed to thousands of excess firearm deaths among children living in states with permissive policies; future work should focus on determining which types of laws conferred the most harm and which offered the most protection.” The study's authors categorized the states, where there was enough data, by three legal groupings of “Strict,” “Permissive” and “Most Permissive,” related to firearm laws. Predictably, they “found” that states with “Strict” firearm regulations post-McDonald v Chicago were associated with less adolescent firearm fatalities. For the media and gun control allies and politicians, the conclusion is clear: states that respect Second Amendment rights are bad, states with strict gun control are better. The New York Times  ran with the story . So too did CNN,  never questioning  the manipulation of the data, even blindly repeating the original debunked claim ABC News  published  the story, as did  others . It was syndicated and published all across the country countless times. But why do the study's authors manipulate the data by using estimated, predicted and crude-rate adjusted figures instead of analyzing the real incidents? The answer is obvious. They did so because the raw figures published by the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) tell a very different story. Raw Data Real Results Rebuilding the data set using the same time, population and mechanism parameters established by the authors using CDC's data tells a different story entirely. The eight states the authors rated as “Strict” and having the most restrictive gun control laws – California, New York, Maryland, Rhode Island, Illinois, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey – on average saw more unadjusted adolescent firearm mortality than the 11 “Permissive” and 30 “Most Permissive” states. Only when adjusting this limited population by the crude rate does the narrative flip. California (“Strict”) and Texas (“Most Permissive”), two states with similarly high populations and diametrically opposing firearm regulations show California as having more adolescent firearm fatalities for the pre- and post-McDonald study period. More Transparency, Better Solutions Sadly, gun control advocates in public health lab coats have for years manipulated data to fit preconceived narratives to tug on emotional heartstrings in order to advance an anti-Second Amendment political agenda. And what better heartstring to pluck than “children.” The firearm industry isn't deterred or distracted by biased studies that push political narratives. For decades, the firearm industry has brought forward effective and proven firearm safety initiatives to keep firearms beyond the reach of those who should never have them. That includes unsupervised children. The firearm industry's  Real Solutions. Safer Communities. ®  initiatives are prime examples of this holistic effort to reduce tragedies while protecting rights. Particularly,  Project ChildSafe®  is the largest and most comprehensive firearm safety education program in the United States, created for gun owners, by the firearm industry. Since its launch in 1999, Project ChildSafe has distributed more than 41 million firearm safety kits that include a locking device and partnered with more than 15,000 law enforcement agencies across the country and five U.S. territories to promote secure firearm storage practices. As the program celebrates its 25th anniversary this year, NSSF and Project ChildSafe remain committed to educating and providing resources to gun owners and non-gun owners alike. NSSF will continue the hard work of educating Americans and working to reduce unauthorized access to firearms. OMG . .

In ihrer Instagram-Story teilte die 28-Jährige ein Foto einer entzündeten Stelle an ihrer unteren Wange. Dabei erklärte sie, dass sie aktuell wieder mit einem Schub ihrer ""perioralen Dermatitis"" zu kämpfen habe – ein Hautausschlag, der laut E! News rund um den Mund auftritt. Hailey schreibt in ihrer Story: ""Es bricht immer dann aus, wenn ich viel unterwegs bin, zu wenig Schlaf habe, durch Hormone, die falsche Sonnencreme, neue Produkte und Stress."" Hailey kennt sich mit der Hauterkrankung inzwischen bestens aus, denn laut E! News leidet sie bereits seit über zehn Jahren darunter. Ihre Pflegeroutine hält sie in solchen Phasen bewusst schlicht und setzt auf beruhigende, entzündungshemmende Produkte. ""So minimal"", schreibt sie in ihrer Story und verrät ihre Routine: ""Gesicht mit Wasser abspülen, verschriebenes Azelainsäure-Gel, hypochlorige Säure, Clindamycin, Glazing Milk."" Bereits im März hatte Hailey offen über einen ähnlichen Schub gesprochen. ""Ich habe eine bessere Balance darin gefunden, wie ich meine Haut in den verschiedenen Phasen und Zuständen behandle"", erklärte sie im Dear Media's Breaking Beauty Podcast. Hautpflege und Beauty gehören für Hailey zum Alltag. Erst vor Kurzem verkaufte sie ihre Beauty-Marke Rhode an das Kosmetikunternehmen e.l.f. Beauty. Die Marke hatte sie vor drei Jahren gegründet und die Nachricht im Mai stolz auf Instagram verkündet. Trotz des Verkaufs bleibt sie der Marke jedoch weiterhin eng verbunden. Als Chief Creative Officer und Head of Innovation wird sie weiterhin die kreative Ausrichtung bestimmen und zusätzlich als strategische Beraterin für e.l.f. tätig sein. Dass sie dabei so offen mit eigenen Hautproblemen umgeht, macht Hailey für viele Fans besonders nahbar – und zeigt, dass selbst eine Beauty-Ikone nicht immer makellose Haut haben muss.

Never mind the puritans were insanely intolerant to the point they started a civil war in England. They were so intolerant that in New England, not having non puritans to pick on, they started persecuting each other. Connecticut and Rhode Island were settled by other colonists kicked out of Massachusetts for not being insanely puritan enough. The actual tolerant colonies were founded later in Pennsylvania by the quakers, and Maryland by the Catholics. A lot of the ideas of religious tolerance comes from Pennsylvania's founding documents. But that was sixty years after Plymouth Rock and the pilgrims thing made a better story so here we are. The pilgrims are a bunch of victims in buckled hats while in reality they were a bunch of religious fundamentalist nuts."

mov_7435D55854472717951D5390995F3736,2025-07-19 16:08:15,en,WEB,"  America's national parks are some of our greatest treasures — but how do we know what's really happening out in all that wilderness? In Untamed, a new Netflix series starring Eric Bana, a special agent for the National Park Service Investigative Services Branch (ISB), tries to answer that question after a body is discovered in Yosemite National Park. This limited series, which is currently the most popular show on Netflix, combines a stunning setting with character-driven drama and a gripping mystery. From our partners: Watch With Us breaks down the reasons you shouldn't miss Untamed on Netflix. The Setting Is Breathtaking Untamed wasn't actually filmed at Yellowstone — instead, it was mostly shot in Canada. However, the verdant hills of British Columbia do a stunning job of standing in for the national park that Bana's character, Kyle Turner, mentions is “the size of Rhode Island.” Between stunning aerial shots of the real Yellowstone and the composite locations used to approximate the park on the ground, Untamed creates an immersive and beautiful world for Turner and park rangers Paul Souter (Sam Neill) and Naya Vazquez (Lily Santiago) to explore. This 2015 Mystery Series Is Popular on Netflix — Here's Why You Should Binge It The Mystery Pulls You In A rock climber over water in 'Untamed' Netflix The body of a Jane Doe is discovered in the most jarring way possible — two mountain climbers see her fall over the edge of a cliff as they're scaling the rock face. The body nearly knocks them down themselves. When Turner enters the case, he's quickly able to determine that the woman was dead before her fall — meaning there's a serious mystery to unravel here. The story integrates all sorts of elements from the park into the mystery itself — Indigenous practices that bear similarities to some Jane Doe's identifying marks, past Yellowstone cases that bear striking similarities and still haunt Turner and the sheer size of the terrain, which makes it disturbingly easy for people to go missing. The twists and turns of the investigation are genuinely unexpected. It Features a Partner Dynamic That Really Works Eric Bana and Lily Santiago in 'Untamed' Netflix As Ranger Vazquez, Lily Santiago does an admirable job of portraying the newer ranger's eagerness to learn from Turner despite his rough and brooding demeanor. She becomes a de facto partner to the ISB investigator, and watching their relationship unfold is one of the true pleasures of the show. Alongside Vazquez, we learn about a tragic incident from Turner's past that shattered his marriage to Jill (Rosemarie DeWitt), which has a significant impact on their Jane Doe investigation. His nearly obsessive fixation on finding justice feels truly motivated, rather than him just playing into the “brooding cop with a dark past” stereotype. Though a “grizzled older cop with an idealistic rookie” is also a familiar trope, Vazquez and Turner's dynamic doesn't feel rote. Instead, their relationship feels refreshing, especially since Vazquez is also hiding secrets of her own. It's a Quick Binge with a Satisfying Ending Eric Bana in 'Untamed' Netflix This may sound like a backhanded compliment, but it's true — at only 6 episodes, Untamed is a show you can get through in a weekend. Surprisingly, it moves at a fast clip without leaving too many loose ends. This Emmy-Nominated 2024 Mystery Show Is Still Criminally Underrated Without giving any spoilers, the show pays off the central mystery in a satisfying way. If you're looking for a mystery thriller that will pull you in and tie everything up by the finale, Untamed is that show — which makes it a great watch. Stream all of Untamed on Netflix now.

The now-former couple first met while working at NBC's Boston affiliate station, WHDH, where she was a meteorologist and Fichera worked as a technician. Dylan announced her separation from Brian in an Instagram statement, vowing that they would remain friends. “I am incredibly grateful for the support and love you've given me through it all,” Dylan wrote, before adding, “For that reason, I want to share with you that a few months ago, Brian and I made the decision to separate. … We began as friends, and we will remain the closest of friends. Most importantly, we will continue to co-parent our three wonderful boys together with nothing but love and respect for one another. Thank you as always for your support.” Hollywood Life has rounded up five things about Dylan, her personal life and career below.

Dylan Dreyer Is a Meteorologist She has gained her experience by working for various television stations, including WICU in Erie, Pennsylvania, WJAR in Providence, Rhode Island, and WHDH in Boston, Massachusetts, before heading over to Today. She also became the host of the NBC educational nature program Journey with Dylan Dreyer. Dylan Dreyer Revealed She Suffered From a Secondary Infertility Secondary Infertility is defined as the inability to conceive or have a full-term pregnancy after having had children without difficulty. The well-known Today Show meteorologist shared the personal news of her miscarriage and infertility struggle in April 2019 via a segment on the morning show. In honor of national infertility awareness week, the weather anchor revealed she hopes to “shed the stigma” surrounding infertility by sharing her truth.

Dylan Dreyer Shares Three Children With Brian Fichera The meteorologist already shares three children with her husband, Brian. Dylan Dreyer Has Been With NBC For More Than a Decade Her impressive resume includes coverage of the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea and Hurricane Gonzalo in Bermuda in 2014. In an interview with SJ Mag, she admitted that covering the hurricane was one of the scariest times of her career. “I was in my hotel room alone, and the curtains were blowing because the windows were bowing so much from the wind,” she said. “I thought for sure the glass was going to break. It was wind like I've never experienced before. I went into the bathroom, because I felt that was safer, crouched down between the toilet and the bathtub. I had no cell phone service and was just counting down the hours until the night would be over. I was scared and alone – I couldn't talk to anyone – and I had no idea what was going to happen. Fortunately, the whole island of Bermuda was fine.”"

However, beneath the surface, sources close to the pop star reveal a more complex reality: a struggle with persistent personal challenges, fluctuating moods, and growing tensions within his marriage to Hailey Bieber. The new album itself offers a glimpse into this internal conflict, featuring introspective interludes that feel strikingly candid, almost like therapy sessions laid bare. This vulnerability comes as Hailey Bieber's Rhode beauty brand experiences unprecedented success, recently securing a landmark $1 billion deal, adding another layer to the dynamic within the couple. Justin Bieber's Comeback: A Mask for Underlying Struggles? MEGA Released on July 11th, “Swag” was accompanied by a series of polished family portraits featuring Bieber, Hailey, and their 11-month-old son, Jack Blues. While the images portray a picture of domestic bliss, insiders suggest this carefully constructed facade may be concealing deeper turmoil. Reports indicate a pattern of increasingly frequent disagreements with paparazzi, subtle displays of friction between Justin and Hailey on social media, and erratic behavior in the months leading up to the album's launch. “He doesn't particularly handle [fame] well,” a source confided to Page Six. “Imagine being thrust into the spotlight at 14, constantly subjected to both adoration and intense scrutiny. It's a pressure cooker that breaks many people. I'm genuinely concerned for him.” Another celebrity insider echoed these concerns, stating Bieber “still has underlying issues” that continue to surface. Did You Know? : Justin Bieber first gained widespread recognition at the age of 15 after being discovered on YouTube by talent manager Scooter Braun. The Singer Gets Real About Fame, Family, and Finding His Way Raw Image LTD/MEGA Four years after the release of “Justice” and two years following the abrupt cancellation of his world tour due to health concerns, Bieber's latest project marks a shift in tone. Now a father, the 31-year-old artist presents a more subdued and introspective persona. The album notably features three interludes with comedian Druski, one of which, titled “Therapy Sessions,” provides a direct window into Bieber's struggles with public perception. “What's been a tough thing for me recently is feeling like I have had to go through a lot of my struggles as a human, as all of us do, really publicly,” Bieber shared during the interlude, with Druski acting as his counselor. “And so people are always asking if I'm OK, and that starts to really weigh on me. It starts to make me feel like I'm the one with the issues and everyone else is perfect.” Justin Bieber's Public Struggles, Marriage Woes, and a Family Under Scrutiny zz/XNY/starmaxinc. com/Newscom/MEGA A source familiar with Bieber's situation told Page Six that his recent social media posts have reflected a sense of frustration and inner turmoil. “If you have a friend and they're posting [like that] – I can tell he's angry just by looking at his posts,” the source explained. “He has mood swings – he's kind of an extreme personality in that sense.” The lyrics of “Walking Away” hint at potential strains in his marriage to Hailey, with lines like: “Days go by so fast, don't wanna spend them with you / So tell me why you're throwing stones at my back / You know I'm defenseless. Girl, we better stop before we say some sh–t / We've been testing our patience / I think we better off if we just take a break.” The couple has made concerted efforts to protect their son, Jack Blues, from the relentless glare of the paparazzi. However, some have questioned Bieber's decision to feature the 11-month-old on the album cover, even with his face obscured. “He obviously wants to protect his kid. But it's like 'Oh, we want privacy,' then they put the kid on album covers and books,” a celebrity insider observed. What do you think about the pressures of fame on young artists like Justin Bieber? And how can celebrities navigate the challenges of maintaining a private life while living in the public eye? With Hailey Bieber's Empire Rising, What's Next for Her Husband? MEGA Financially, the Bieber family appears secure, largely due to Hailey's thriving Rhode beauty brand. The company recently finalized a $1 billion deal with e.l.f. Cosmetics, including $800 million in cash and an additional $200 million contingent on future growth. This success has led to speculation about Justin Bieber's next move. The question of whether Bieber will embark on a tour to support “Swag” remains unanswered. Insiders suggest this decision is particularly significant given Hailey's company's rapid expansion. Those close to the singer believe a return to the stage could be beneficial for both his professional and personal well-being. “He needs to perform,” a celebrity insider stated...."

Then he tried to push out his father's adviser. BY CHUN HAN WONG AND STU WOO *Singapore* The gala felt straight out of the movie “Crazy Rich Asians.” In this tropical-island nation famously dense with millionaires, 600 guests gathered in September 2023 to fete one of Singapore's most prominent success stories: the property empire that owns the global Millennium hotel chain and the Biltmore Los Angeles. The politicians, business leaders and foreign envoys in attendance heaped praise on the company's octogenarian executive chairman, Kwek Leng Beng, who built a family fortune estimated at $11.5 billion and made deals with the likes of Donald Trump. Guests at the blacktie dinner savored abalone, bird's nest soup and lobster, while dancers and musicians performed on a stage. At the head table, the tycoon, clad in a blue tuxedo, reigned with his wife, Cecilia. But there was another woman in the ballroom, wearing a red dress, whose presence wasn't welcome to some in the family. Catherine Wu, a Juilliard-trained pianist and former television host in her native Taiwan, was well-known to company executives for her close relationship with the chairman. Senior executives had long bristled at what they saw as her interference in the hotel business, according to people familiar with the matter. But until this moment, she had largely shunned the limelight and avoided public company events. The internal complaints about her outsize influence remained unknown to the public. Now Wu was thrusting herself into the spotlight, introducing herself to the dignitaries—including Singapore's prime minister-in-waiting— and posing for photos with them. Onlookers blanched. People sympathetic to Cecilia Kwek and concerned about Wu's influence at the company thought Wu, by attending the gala, had crossed a line. Earlier this year, the tensions that seethed at the event burst into the open. The chairman's elder son and chosen successor, Sherman Kwek, 49, and his allies moved to add new directors to the board, a maneuver he later said was meant to eliminate Wu's influence at the family business, called City Developments Ltd., or CDL for short. “She has been interfering in matters going well beyond her scope, and she wields and exercises enormous influence,” Sherman Kwek said in a statement on behalf of the majority of the board, issued in February after the feud erupted into public view. “Due to her long relationship with the chairman, efforts that were made to manage the situation were done sensitively, but to no avail.” Kwek Leng Beng fought back by trying to dismiss his son as chief executive and suing him for allegedly trying to usurp power—something that Sherman denies. The elder Kwek later said Wu had contributed to the business's success and decried his son's “unproven insinuations.” Wu, in her first public comments on the matter, told The Wall Street Journal in an email this month that her relationship to the chairman was “purely professional.” She said the elder Kwek had “asked for and considered my feedback on business ideas,” adding that she had “had no role in the decision-making process” at CDL. She said the dispute was between board members and “has nothing to do with me, although some parties have used my name to stoke the flames.” Weeks after the clash, the sides agreed to a truce. The public warring had done no good for a company dealing with high debt and a lackluster share price. In March, the elder Kwek announced Wu's resignation as an adviser at CDL's hotel subsidiary and dropped his lawsuit. His son remains CEO, backed by additional allies on the board and a company resolution declaring that Wu has no power to influence or direct management and staff at CDL and its hotel business. But Wu is still in contact with one person at CDL: the 84-year-old chairman. People at the company say the elder Kwek and Wu, who turns 66 this month, have recently been seen meeting at CDL-owned properties. It means, the people say, that the saga is far from over. **Strictly business** Just north of the equator, six million people swelter in a city-state about a quarter of Rhode Island's size. A disproportionate many are millionaires, and some of Singapore's richest residents are members of family businesses that predate the nation's 60 years of independence. As Singapore transformed from a colonial outpost into a hub of prosperity, the Kwek clan was there to help build it every step of the way. Kwek Leng Beng's father, Kwek Hong Png, started a constructionmaterials store in 1941, when Singapore was a British colony. Kwek Leng Beng joined the business in 1963 and was given stern training by his father, as he and Cecilia recounted in an authorized biography, “Strictly Business.” When the couple were dating, Kwek Leng Beng's father imposed a curfew. “The old man wanted him to be in bed by 9 p.m.,” Cecilia said in the biography. Kwek Leng Beng and Cecilia, both London-trained lawyers, wed in 1970.

mov_CDF56F37B9D92C4BD9B6C646789F74AE,2025-07-20 07:30:00,en,WEB,"  After Astronomer CEO Andy Byron was caught on Coldplay's kiss cam embracing a colleague, he resigned, sparking viral interest in his private life. Married to educator Megan Kerrigan, with two sons and a $1 million home, Byron's net worth remains undisclosed. Megan, known for her inclusive education work, quietly stepped back from social media after the incident.Some stories hit the internet like a meteor—unexpected, swift, and wildly disruptive. That's exactly what happened when Andy Byron, the former CEO of the tech unicorn Astronomer, found himself at the centre of a very public and very awkward moment. At a Coldplay concert in Boston, as the band swayed into a romantic ballad, the infamous “kiss cam” swept across the crowd and landed squarely on Byron—who was caught on camera embracing not his wife, but his company's HR head Kristin Cabot. Within hours, the footage was all over TikTok, Twitter (now X), and Instagram. Over 5.8 million views later, the internet was buzzing—not just about the alleged affair, but about everything else people suddenly wanted to know about Byron's life. Who is he married to? How many kids does he have? Where does he live? And—because the internet never misses a beat—what's his net worth? Let's unpack the drama and dive into the life of Andy Byron, his wife Megan Kerrigan, their children, lifestyle, and what his astronomical (pun intended) tech career might mean for his bank balance. Andy Byron's Net Worth Despite leading a company worth over $1.3 billion, Andy Byron has kept his personal finances tightly under wraps. Unlike some of his more flamboyant Silicon Valley peers, Byron doesn't parade Teslas on Instagram or post from yachts off Mykonos. But make no mistake—he's likely a millionaire many times over. Astronomer, the company he led until July 2025, has raised over $93 million from heavyweight investors including Bain Capital. CEOs in this league typically earn a mix of handsome salaries, annual bonuses, and significant equity stakes. While Byron's exact holdings aren't public, former roles at Lacework, Cybereason, and Fuze—where he helped scale revenue from $20 million to over $100 million—suggest he's no stranger to high-end compensation packages. Add that to his CEO stint at Astronomer, and his wealth, though unconfirmed, would reasonably be estimated in the multi-million-dollar range. The real question? How much of that is liquid, and how much is tied up in company shares waiting to vest or cash out—particularly if Astronomer goes public in the near future. How Has Andy Byron's Career Evolved Over Time? Before stepping into the limelight—accidentally or otherwise—Andy Byron quietly built a formidable career in enterprise software. His journey began in Massachusetts, where he grew up in a community-driven environment and later graduated from Providence College in Rhode Island. He started out at firms like VeriCenter, BMC Software, and BladeLogic, earning his stripes in sales and strategic leadership. But it was at Fuze and Cybereason where Byron really made a name for himself, scaling operations and revenue in the fiercely competitive cybersecurity and communication tech markets. By 2023, he had landed the top job at Astronomer, a rapidly growing data orchestration platform used globally by tech-forward companies. As former CEO, Byron was responsible for shaping the company's partnership with Amazon Web Services and expanding Astronomer's role in the AI and machine learning ecosystem. Even amid his personal scandal, his professional track record remains largely respected. Megan Kerrigan Byron: The Woman Behind the Name Amidst the frenzy of TikToks and tweet threads, one name kept coming up: Megan Kerrigan Byron. Megan, born around 1975, is a respected American educator and administrator currently serving as the Associate Director at the prestigious Bancroft School in Worcester, Massachusetts. Known for her commitment to inclusive education and student advocacy, Megan had a quiet but impactful public presence—until July 2025. After the kiss cam incident, she made a subtle but telling move: she removed “Byron” from her surname on social media and quietly deactivated her accounts. No official statements followed, but the digital silence spoke volumes. Professionally, Megan has continued her work in education, prioritising admissions and equity. Personally, she appears to be taking a step back from the limelight, focusing on her two children and career in Massachusetts. Megan Kerrigan: Early Life and Background Raised in the United States during the 1970s, Megan developed a deep interest in education from an early age. She built a career around it—first as a teacher, then as an administrator—earning respect in academic circles. She has long been involved in inclusive education, shaping policies that better serve children from diverse backgrounds. Her marriage to Andy Byron brought her into tech-adjacent social circles, but she largely remained focused on education, sharing wholesome family photos, holiday updates, and milestone celebrations online. That changed abruptly after the Coldplay concert spotlight, which may have shifted the dynamics of her otherwise private family life. Megan Kerrigan: Recent Updates Here's a quick snapshot of Megan's recent timeline: 2023–2024 Continued work at Bancroft School, emphasising inclusive admissions. Actively shared family life via social media, often posting photos from events and school holidays. July 16: The Coldplay concert incident goes viral.

The Vatican announced last month that the ailing child, Tyquan Hall, who was born prematurely via emergency cesarean section and left with no detectable pulse, made a full recovery after a doctor invoked the name of a long-forgotten 19th-century Spanish priest. The declaration elevates not just a miraculous story of life snatched from the jaws of death but also the potential sainthood of the humble cleric whose name was called in a moment of need.    ' We are thrilled that this recognition will move the cause of beatification and canonization forward for Venerable Servant of God Salvador Valera Parra,' said Rev. Timothy Reilly of the Diocese of Providence, calling the papal pronouncement a blessing for Rhode Island and beyond. The miracle marks the first to be authenticated under Pope Leo XIV, the newly elected American pontiff, and it may set in motion the canonization of Father Valera Parra, a priest who died in Spain in 1889 and had no known miracles to his name, until now. link    I am filing this under 'Buddhism' as well as 'religion' because many Buddhists, including me, also believe in miracles and paranormal phenomena. All words, concepts and religions have overlapping meanings and describe overlapping realities. Buddhism, as I understand it, is very open to this side of human thought and existence. Philosophically, the term emptiness does not at all mean 'nothingness' or 'you don't exist'. It means all sensory and mental data is transient, like lightning, like dew, and may be wondered over, admired, even sought, but is not nailable to any wall of definite meaning. ABN"

mov_7B060BE6AB2A828338DACE60CF064B7E,2025-07-20 16:10:41,en,WEB,"  July 20, 2025 REGIONAL By Gina Christian, OSV News The intercession of Venerable Salvador Valera Parra, a 19th-century Spanish diocesan priest, has been credited by Pope Leo XIV for the miraculous recovery of critically-ill newborn Tyquan Hall in 2007 at a Rhode Island hospital, in a decree issued June 20, 2025. (IObserve photo/courtesy of Diocese of Providence) (OSV News) — Rhode Islanders are celebrating Pope Leo XIV's declaration that the healing of a baby born in their state back in 2007 was indeed miraculous, and advances the sainthood cause of a 19th-century Spanish priest. Pope Leo XIV had promulgated the acceptance of the miracle for Venerable Salvador Valera Parra on June 20, with decrees for various other sainthood cause recognitions presented to the pope by Cardinal Marcello Semeraro, prefect of the Vatican's Dicastery for the Causes of Saints. The dicastery's website specified that Father Valera's intercession had been attributed to the miraculous resuscitation of “little Tyquan,” born critically ill Jan. 14, 2007, at the now-closed Memorial Hospital in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Catholic News Service in Rome had noted the U.S. connection in its June 20 story on the decrees. But local coverage of the miracle gained momentum July 18, following a GoLocalProv article published that day by religion writer Daniel J. Holmes. Holmes cited a June 20 interview by Vida Nueva — a Madrid-based Catholic news outlet — with the attending physician at the infant's delivery, Dr. Juan Sánchez-Esteban, a native of Huércal-Overa, located in Spain's Diocese of Almería. Vida Nueva published the child's full name as Tyquan Hall. Sánchez-Esteban told Vida Nueva the infant — who according to the dicastery's website had been prematurely through induced labor and then Caesarean section due to a low fetal heart rate — was barely breathing and after an hour of recovery efforts lacked a pulse. In a July 18 statement posted on its Facebook page, the Diocese of Providence, Rhode Island, explained baby Tyquan had not drawn a breath or demonstrated a pulse “for 65 minutes despite life-saving measures.” Desperate, the Spanish doctor recalled a childhood prayer to Father Salvador Valera Parra, a diocesan priest born 1816 in Sánchez-Esteban's hometown. The dicastery noted on its website that Father Valera, who died in 1889, “distinguished himself for many works of a spiritual and social nature,” especially during cholera outbreaks and earthquakes in his area of service. Sánchez-Esteban told Vida Nueva that he said, “Father Valera, I have done everything possible; now it's your turn.” As the doctor headed to inform the parents of their child's death, a nurse advised that the child began breathing normally, with a restored heartbeat, according to Vida Nueva — with the dicastery noting on its website the recovery took place “without any external intervention.” The dicastery webpage said Tyquan was then transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit at the Women and Infants Hospital, and remained there “for 15 days with a diagnosis of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.” “Doctors were certain he would suffer serious developmental damage, such as cerebral palsy or intellectual disability,” said the dicastery on its website. “However, despite his clinical symptoms, the child showed spontaneous activity.” On March 1, 2007, Tyquan was transferred to Hasbro Children's Hospital, having undergone a colectomy procedure, and then fully discharged on April 3, 2007. “Subsequent checkups revealed psychomotor development that led him to speak at 18 months and walk at 2 years of age,” said the dicastery. “Little Tyquan continued to grow like a normal child, leading a regular life and participating in sports.” The Providence Diocese's chancellor Father Timothy Reilly called the miracle “wonderful news” in a statement and said the diocese was “thrilled” the miracle would advance Father Valera's cause forward toward beatification and finally canonization, which would require a second verified miracle. Father Reilly, who had assisted the Diocese of Almería in the 2014 investigation of Father Valera's sainthood cause according to the Providence Diocese, said the miracle “is a reminder of the power of prayer and the intercession of holy men and women. God is indeed close to us.”"
mov_20DAE851604F32BB26BA48EED1C4EDC4,2025-07-20 17:14:34,en,WEB,"  Traveling as a family can always be difficult, as parents scramble to get their toddlers through airport security. However, a new campaign might make the process easier. On Friday, the United States Department of Homeland Security announced the launch of the “Families on the Fly” campaign in a press release, aimed at reducing the stress associated with traveling as a family. The initiative includes creating a dedicated family lane for TSA security, designed to reduce overall wait times and streamline the process. “There will be expanded areas that will give them the benefit of recognizing that they have children with them and will help make sure that we have the ability to take care of them and their families as they go through this expedited process with their kiddos,” Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said at a press conference. The campaign will also offer a discount for families interested in using TSA PreCheck, where the cost will be $85 per person instead of $100. Under the current regulations, children under 12 are permitted in the TSA Precheck line as long as they are traveling with someone who is enrolled in the program. Children between the ages of 13 and 17 must be booked under the same flight registration as their parents/guardians who are enrolled. The “Families on the Fly” campaign is currently being implemented at the Orlando International and Charlotte-Douglas International airports, with planned expansions to John Wayne Orange County Airport and Daniel K. Inouye International Airport in Honolulu. In the coming months, the initiative will also be added to Charleston International Airport, Jacksonville International Airport, T.F. Green International Airport in Rhode Island, Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in Puerto Rico, and Tampa International Airport. The news of the new TSA comes a few days after Noem revealed during a conference hosted by The Hill on Wednesday that she is questioning “everything TSA does” and spoke of possible changes to the amount of liquids travelers can tote in their carry-on baggage. “The liquids, I'm questioning. So that may be the next big announcement is what size your liquids need to be,” Noem said. “We have put in place in TSA a multilayered screening process that allows us to change some of how we do security and screening so it's still as safe.” More in U.S. She gave no details about precisely what those changes might be or how quickly travelers could expect to see them. Under the Transportation and Security Administration's current guidance, travelers can carry liquids in travel-sized containers 3.4 ounces (100 milliliters) or less per item in their carry-on bag. Those containers must be placed in a one-quart resealable plastic bag. Bigger containers must be placed in checked baggage, although there are exceptions for medications and baby formula."

Acknowledgements related to traveling to Maui  There was a devastating tragedy in Lahaina. It was especially mentioned on the Sail Maui sunset cruise we went on. There's a loud contingent of Hawaiians who post on social media, put up signs, and behave aggressively toward tourists. It costs a lot to travel to Maui. It's an unusual time in our lives that allows us the financial resources to go. I'm going to pronounce very few of the place names I bring up correctly. What resources did I use to plan our trip? The Hawaii Vacation Guide. Click here for their YouTube Channel Page. Erica and Jordan run the page. Maui Revealed: The Ultimate Guidebook by Andrew Doughty. I bought the paperback and the Kindle book for my iPad. Click here for Amazon page. Which island should we visit in Hawaii? For me it was O'ahu or Maui. For O'ahu, fly into Honolulu. Go to Waikiki Beach, hike Diamond Head, and visit Pearl Harbor. I can see now there is a lot there I don't know anything about. For Maui, Maui, resources pointed to it as a place for families with quieter coves, quieter both from a crowd standpoint and a more calm water standpoint. We're going to look at a map and talk about the geography, what's where on Maui:  Anne, how would you describe the shape of Maui? Lopsided dumb bell. Two halves connected by a bar/isthmus connecting the two halves. One of the halves is much larger. Could be a head as the smaller part, the isthmus as the neck, and then shoulders and a torso. An AI overview: Maui is composed of two volcanic landmasses: the West Maui Mountains (Mauna Kahalawai) and the larger Haleakalā volcano. These two halves are connected by a relatively flat, narrow strip of land known as an isthmus, which gives the island its unique profile and its nickname, the “Valley Isle”. This central plain was historically used for sugarcane fields. Let's talk about the different areas of Maui: West Maui with Napili, Kaanapali, and Lahaina. Central Maul with Maalaea Harbor on the south end and the airport on the north end. South Maui with Kihei, Wailea, and Makena. UpCountry with Haleakala National Park and Summit. Road to Hana. Twin Falls. Remember to go back into these areas and go into more detail about what we did, what we recommend, what we decided not to do. What did we do that we liked? We started in disbelief at the scenery. Could be as simple as sitting on a balcony and doing light work on the computer or reading while also looking at the view. Napili Bay. More of the pools and being on the beach. Keawakapu Beach. Our VRBO condo rental at the Mana Kai had a great view right from the balcony. Snorkeled. We rented gear from Snorkel Bob's for the week from right by our resort.They have several locations. Boogie boarded. We walked on the beach and beach paths. We purchased fruit bowls and took them to beautiful places to eat. We ate pizza and fish. We went to a great food truck park. There are several...."
n48rxg3,2025-07-20 22:35:23,en,REDDIT,"  [Villain's Code](https://www.goodreads.com/series/196608-villains-code) By Drew Hayes. This is my favorite I've read so far. [Super Powereds](https://www.goodreads.com/series/115317-super-powereds) by Drew Hayes [Confessions of a D-List Supervillain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11334430-confessions-of-a-d-list-supervillain) by Jim Bernheimer [Soon I Will Be Invincible](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/645180.Soon_I_Will_Be_Invincible) by Austin Grossman. I wasn't a huge fan of this one, but it gets good reviews so I feel I should mention it. [Dr. Anarchy's Rules for World Domination: Or How I Became God-Emperor of Rhode Island](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30314861-dr-anarchy-s-rules-for-world-domination) by Nelson Chereta. It's kind of campy, but still fun. [Hench](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49867430-hench) by Natalie Zina Walschots [The Rook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10836728-the-rook) by Daniel O'Malley. The second book wasn't as good, but still decent. There are 2 more that I just found out come out. Not really superheroes, but super powered people. [Batman: No Man's Land](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/107105.Batman) by Greg Rucka. The novelization of No Man's land was really good. [Scatter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60273642-scatter) by Molly J. Bragg. This is more romance set in a world with heroes, but I still really enjoyed it. I read it like a day."
18408151045106357,2025-07-20 23:30:31,en,INSTAGRAM,"  Book Review The Wedding People By Alison Espach ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐ I was definitely not expecting to like this book as much as I did. I was also expecting it to have more of a heavier feel to it, but it was actually more of a happier story. It was like a coming of age story for a forty something year old woman. The ending was perfect too Goodreads Summary: It's a beautiful day in Newport, Rhode Island, when Phoebe Stone arrives at the grand Cornwall Inn wearing a green dress and gold heels, not a bag in sight, alone. She's immediately mistaken by everyone in the lobby for one of the wedding people, but she's actually the only guest at the Cornwall who isn't here for the big event. Phoebe is here because she's dreamed of coming for years-she hoped to shuck oysters and take sunset sails with her husband, only now she's here without him, at rock bottom, and determined to have one last decadent splurge on herself. Meanwhile, the bride has accounted for every detail and every possible disaster the weekend might yield except for, well, Phoebe and Phoebe's plan-which makes it that much more surprising when the two women can't stop confiding in each other. #bookreview #bookreviewer #audiobook #audiobooks #audiobooklover #theweddingpeople #alisonespach  #romance #summer #bookstagram #booksta"

I started out with wanting to improve Cinder's background story which spread into thinking about Rhode's and then Roman and the Spider Gang as a way to get my OC to interact with Atlas, Glass Unicorn, and so on."

Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder to absorb oil and blur pores so effectively that you'll be like, ""Oh...witchcraft??"" Might be the only explanation for how this can matte-ify your complexion while still keeping it radiant and glowy like the fresh summer dew. ✨ Promising review: ""I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe."" —Charlotte Laim Price: $25 2. A pair of Bottega Veneta–inspired pilot shield sunglasses so close to the $699 version that reviewers are *spooked* by the attention to detail, down to the weight of them. These are already blowing up on TikTok so I'd personally grab them NOW before everyone descends on them. Promising review: ""TikTok made me buy these!! One video did it for me and I RAN to Amazon. And yes, I bought ALLL the colors. They fit like a dream and are good quality. People that know their sunglasses thought these were the REAL THING! For the price, these are made EXTREMELY well and look hecka expensive. Get all the colors so you can wear them for every season."" —Santana Davis Price: $14.99 (available in 10 tints) 3. E.l.f. Glow Reviver Melting Lip Balm for all the ultra fans of Summer Fridays, Rhode, and Laneige whose bank accounts are begging them to put a stop to the lippie madness. These new deliciously tinted, moisturizing, buildable glosses are just as buttery and decadent as the balms that inspired them, for a fraction of the price. (Brb, drowning myself in the ""Strawberry Shortcake"" and ""Vanilla Toffee"" flavors.) Promising review: ""Diva, stop letting these influencers sway you into spending your hard-earned (and scarce) beans on $20–$30 subpar lip balms — you're paying for the brand, and the quality is questionable. ELF KNOCKED THEM BOTH OUTTA THE PARK WITH THIS! SO BUTTERY, SO YUMMY, SOOOOOOO MUCH PRODUCT!!!!! i wasn't expecting the tube to be so generous in size, by far the biggest amount I've seen from the market. The flavors are divine, the color payoff is even better than Summer Fridays … and it's only $9, you cannot go wrong. I just can't fathom any balm being priced above $12, E.l.f. always hits and barely misses. "" —SONIA Price: $9 (available in Strawberry Shortcake, Blackberry Sorbet, Java Chip, Vanilla Toffee, Wild Cherry, and Yummy Gummy). 4. Dae's Hair Cactus Fruit 3-In-1 Styling Cream & Taming Wand, which is basically the brand's ""holy grail,"" TikTok-famous styling cream in the form of a mascara wand. This versatile lil' tool helps you carefully target flyaways, style edges, and smooth frizz. Dae is a small business that specializes in haircare and styling products. Check out a TikTok of the taming wand in action. (It goes without saying that you don't need to lay your edges if you don't want to, but this is a handy option if you do.) Promising review: ""I've tried numerous products for taming baby hairs, especially post-partum, and this is hands down the best thing I've tried. It also smells incredible! Love the size of the styling wand!"" —Completely happy customer! Price: $17 5. Sol de Janeiro's Jet Set for anyone who wants to try all the most iconic products that come in the brand's cult-favorite ""sunshine"" scents without paying a pretty penny for all three — now you can snag a Bum Bum Cream, body and hair mist, *and* body wash in one convenient set, and even take them traveling with you. Psst — you can get this in the original Cheirosa 62 scents, *plus* three others! Promising review: ""Lately, I've been wanting to find a signature fragrance versus just smelling clean. I tried several perfumes, including high-end, and they just didn't seem to be a good fit with my body chemistry, or the smells just seemed to disappear...."
