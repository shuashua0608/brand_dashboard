A detangling brush, because if you think getting tangles out of your hair is hard, try doing it for a squirmy, screeching toddler. With more than 60,000 5-star ratings, parents love that this brush makes wet or dry brushing a lot less painful for everyone. Promising review: ""I'm a single dad of a 6-year-old girl, and combing her hair is the hardest part of taking care of her. She gets really bad knots in her hair. This brush is the only thing that has ever worked. Thank you so much. She even likes to comb her own hair now."" —Eric Phan Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in eight colors) 2. A cradle cap comb if your baby has hard-to-remove flakes on their sensitive scalp (like ours did)! We used this tool to help remove it gently — just add an oil, massage it on, and go to work. Your baby will feel like they're at a trendy head spa. Read more about cradle cap — aka seborrheic dermatitis — at Seattle Children's and the American Academy of Dermatology. Promising review: ""I wish I had taken pictures of the amount of dead skin I have gotten off my newborn's head!!!! The pictures posted here are legit. It makes removal so much easier and gives more consistent removal than my previous method of washcloths or just scratching the cradle cap off with my fingernails. It's amazing and gross and wonderful. My babe doesn't even flinch when I spend 10 minutes clearing his scalp of all the goo. It seems to be soothing to him. I just apply baby shampoo, then brush a little with the blue brush. Then, I slowly started to comb the sections all in one direction. Then I go back and forth in different directions. It's shocking the amount of dead skin that comes off. I've even used it successfully in his eyebrows (he gets some cradle cap there, too). This is a KEEPER!"" —ZMomUtah Get it from Amazon for $5.99 3. A leave-in conditioning spray for curly hair to bring life to your little one's hair. As a curly-haired girl myself, I know firsthand that it can be harder to get tangles out. Spray this after washing to keep things shiny, smooth, and frizz free for your little one. Promising review: ""This stuff is fantastic for curly girls! I spray it in my daughter's dry hair in the morning, run my fingers through her ringlets (never ever comb or brush curly hair dry), and then clip the top back. It smells amazing, and the price on Amazon is better than other national retailers I've found it at. The price is worth it. Minimizes frizz and keeps curls soft and natural-looking. My daughter has soft/fine thick hair."" —Carolyn Smith Get it from Amazon for $7.49+ (available in two sizes and a two-pack). 4. A scalp massager for those long summer days when you need a little help getting the dirt, sand, grass, ice cream, spilled juice, and more out of your toddler's hair. (Use this on your scalp, too, for some extra relaxation.) Promising review: ""My daughter had lots of problems with [a] dry scalp; after using this for just a few days, her scalp looks great! No more dandruff or dry patches. She loves it and uses it all the time now."" —april Get it from Amazon for $4.96+ (available in three colors)..."

Some afforable Eos Shea Butter Vanilla Cashmere body lotion that TikTokers are tripping over themselves to get as they swear it moisturizes and smells as good as much more expensive options from brands like Philosophy and Bath & Body Works. Promising reviews: ""I first saw this lotion on TikTok; an influencer was bragging about it! Let me tell you, she did not lie. This lotion is the BEST. It smells fantastic. A cross between cotton candy and vanilla, it's just so fresh. It makes my skin smooth all day. This large bottle will last me a couple of months. Thank you, Eos, for such a fantastic lotion.  "" —Erin ""Very similar to my Burberry fragrance, and they layer beautifully. I always get tons of compliments on the scent. I also purchase the jasmine and berry  for a more fruity option but to me it just smells like regular lotion. Cost per use is well worth it considering how thick the lotion is. It also actually moisturizes while leaving a fragrance behind instead of drying my skin out due to the perfume. I have sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions."" —Violet Frahm Get it from Amazon for $9.97 (available in various scents and packs). 2. A tube of Essence's Lash Princess Mascara to give you a falsies-level look for less than five bucks. It seems questionable, I know, but for confirmation, you need only look at the 262,000+ 5-star reviews!! Promising review: ""After using Lights, Camera, Lashes by Tarte for the past year, I got tired of breaking the bank over mascara. My sister suggested Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect and I IMMEDIATELY fell in love. It provides dramatic length and great volume. I can honestly say I can't stop looking at my eyelashes in the mirror every single day because of how awesome they look. Also, it is very long-wearing. I go from an eight-hour workday right to the gym and sweat [a lot]. . and this stuff doesn't budge! I love it!!"" —Carrie E Weikert Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (available in black or brown and as a three-pack). 3. A long-sleeve bodysuit in a deliciously soft fabric — known as Smoke Cloud — that reviewers compare to Skims. They say it washes well, too, so you can count on it being high quality despite the deceivingly low price! And BTW, reviewers say the double lining in the torso is supportive, so they don't need to wear a bra. Promising review: ""Are you kidding me? This is the softest, most comfortable body suit I've ever owned. I got so many compliments lol; everyone did think they were Skims lol, but it's definitely worth every penny. I love and will be getting more colors!!! You need it."" —Wendy L. Get it from Amazon for $28.99 (available in women's sizes XS–3X and 13 colors). And check out all the styles available in the Smoke Cloud fabric here. 4. Elizavecca's Collagen Coating Hair Protein Treatment — it works just like a hair mask to repair your locks in five minutes flat. The ceramide 3- and collagen-packed formula repairs all types of hair, whether you've got over-processed tresses or 4c hair that's susceptible to dryness. Reviewers even say the $8 product is comparable to Olaplex No. 3!..."

n43xjm5,2025-07-20 03:42:45,en,REDDIT,"  And I feel the opposite, haha! I was hoping to see some great skincare, in addition to some nice foundations (and *some* makeup - but I am more of a skincare girlie, lol). For me, I think that the RMS concealer might be okay/nice to try - assuming they offer the shade I need (000 or 00, based on their website - I'm Casper, lol) and maybe the Makeup by Mario highlighter might be okay, too (if it's not super flashy, as they describe it), when it comes to makeup... as I have way too many mascaras, eyeshadow palettes (especially the same colour story), eyeliners, and clear brow gel (plus I just got that same brow gel in my July GB). Never mind that they don't seem all that ""luxe"" to me. When it comes to hair and skincare, the Kopari, Odacité, Amika, Briogeo, & Saturday Skin products aren't too bad - but again, they're not giving ""luxury"" or *Icon Box* to me... idk what I'm hoping for, I guess... I mean, I don't think I'd be ***MAD*** if I got a few of the spoiled items that I have my eye on and some other nice (luxe) products, as well as other ones that follow my preferences and whose price-points actually fit an Icon Box. Hbu? Would you be happy with a box that had a few of these makeup products as well as others that fit your preferences and that are suitable from an Icon Box? With all of their constant price increases that they claim are going to help them give us better quality, better products, etc.. , we should be getting the highest-end, most awesome boxes yet, at this point!!!"
