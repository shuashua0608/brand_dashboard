mov_7B72729FCFCA514E9AA64222BBFFF2FE,2025-07-14 09:42:19,en,WEB,"  Adobe released final figures for the Prime Day event (recapping July 8 to 11, 2025)—looking at consumer spending online, discounts, and other trends across U.S. retailers. Adobe's report provides the most comprehensive view into U.S. e-commerce by analyzing direct transactions online, covering over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million SKUs, and 18 product categories. A new benchmark for summer e-commerce U.S. retailers drove $24.1 billion in online spend from July 8 (Tuesday) to July 11 (Friday), representing 30.3% growth year-over-year (YoY). This is more than two Black Fridays—which drove $10.8 billion in online spend during the 2024 holiday shopping season—and sets a new benchmark for the summer shopping season. Mobile was the dominant transaction channel during the Prime Day event, driving the majority of sales (53.2% share vs desktop shopping) and contributing $12.8 billion in online spend. Competitive discounts across U.S. retailers drove price-sensitive shoppers to spend in categories such as appliances, where online sales were up 112% (compared to average daily sales in June 2025). Other categories with strong growth included office supplies (up 105%), electronics (up 95%), books (up 81%), tools & home improvement (up 76%), home & garden (up 58%), and baby & toddler (up 55%). Hot sellers included products such as kids' apparel (up 250%), home security products (up 185%), refrigerators & freezers (up 160%), games (up 160%), headphones & speakers (up 155%), car seats (up 145%), luggage (up 145%), vacuum cleaners (up 140%), power tools (up 135%), computers (up 125%), washers & dryers (up 125%), smartphone accessories (up 120%), storage furniture (up 120%), TVs (up 90%), small kitchen appliances (up 90%), and exercise equipment (up 80%). The Prime Day event has also been cemented as a “back-to-school” shopping moment, as consumers took advantage of deals and got a head start on purchases for the upcoming school season. School supplies (such as backpacks, lunchboxes, binders, calculators, and kids' apparel) were up 175%. And dorm essentials (microwaves, mini fridges, bedroom linens, twin/full mattresses, laundry & cleaning products, and storage products) were up 84%. Consumers embraced generative AI and social influencers Shoppers are increasingly using generative AI-powered chat services and browsers as a shopping assistant. During the Prime Day event, generative AI traffic to U.S. retail sites (measured by shoppers clicking on a link) increased by 3,300% YoY. And while AI-driven traffic remains modest compared to other channels (paid search, email), the growth shows the impact of AI on shoppers looking for deals or specific product details. Social influencers also played a major role in driving traffic to U.S. retail sites during the Prime Day event. While paid search remained the top driver of retail sales online (28.5% share of revenue, up 5.6% YoY), affiliates and partners—which includes social media influencers—saw a greater lift (19.9% share, up 15% YoY). Adobe's data also showed that influencers converted shoppers (individuals making a purchase after seeing influencer content) 10 times more than social media overall. Additional Adobe insights Competitive discounts drove online demand: U.S. retailers leaned into discounts to drive growth, with a consumer that remains price sensitive. Shoppers found deals that trended above last year's Prime Day event, with discounts for apparel peaking at 24% off listed price (vs. 20% in 2024). Strong discounts were also seen in electronics at 23% (vs. 23%), toys at 19% (vs. 15%), televisions at 18% (vs. 16%), appliances at 17% (vs. 14%), furniture at 16% (vs. 16%), computers at 13% (vs. 11%), and sporting goods at 11% (vs. 11%). Consumers gravitated towards pricier goods: Strong discounts during the Prime Day event drove many shoppers to “trade up” to higher-ticket items. Across all categories tracked by Adobe, the share of the most expensive goods increased by 20% (compared to average levels year-to-date). In electronics, the share of the most expensive goods rose significantly by 57%. Adobe also observed consumers trading up in categories such as appliances (up 36%), sporting goods (up 30%), furniture (up 28%), toys (up 19%), personal care (up 13%), and apparel (up 11%). Categories where consumers embraced lower priced products included grocery (share of most expensive goods down 7%), and home & garden (down 2%). Buy Now Pay Later usage saw uptick: Consumers continue to embrace more flexible ways to manage their budgets. During the Prime Day event, 'Buy Now Pay Later' (BNPL) orders accounted for 8.1% of online orders (up from 7.4% in 2024). This amounted to $2.0 billion in online spend from July 8 to 11, representing 33.3% growth YoY. In an Adobe survey of 1,000 U.S. consumers (conducted June 2025), respondents reported using BNPL most in product categories such as apparel, electronics, home goods, and health & beauty. Impact of inflation Strong spending during the Prime Day event was driven by net-new demand, as opposed to higher prices. The Adobe Digital Price Index, which tracks online prices across 18 product categories, shows that e-commerce prices have fallen for 34 months—down 2.1% YoY in June 2025. Adobe's numbers are not adjusted for inflation, but if online inflation were factored in, there would be even higher growth in topline consumer spend."

Expected Tuesday are CPI figures for June. ""Should the June data report higher-than-expected inflation, this could prompt a selloff in U.S. Treasuries and increase demand for the U.S. dollar this week,"" FP Markets said . JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup and Wells Fargo report their earnings Tuesday. Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley and Johnson & Johnson are due to report Wednesday. Earnings from other major companies including Netflix, American Express and PepsiCo will follow later in the week.

What Could Go Wrong. - Higher Tariffs Would Likely Spur ECB to Further Cut Rates MARKET WRAPS Forex: The dollar rose against a basket of currencies to a nearly three-week high. Investors were assuming countries will give in to Trump's trade demands and that the EU was potentially willing to accept a trade deal favoring the U.S., Commerzbank said. The euro fell against the dollar to its lowest in nearly three weeks after Trump's latest tariff threat against the EU. Sterling fell against the dollar and the euro, and the currency could face further losses, as concerns regarding the U.K.'s lack of fiscal headroom weighed, ING said. The Mexican peso fell slightly after Trump threatened a 30% tariff on the country's goods. Bonds: The three-year Treasury yield fell, the 10-year yield was largely flat and the 30-year yield rose. Investors should keep betting on a further steepening of the yield curve, said Morgan Stanley. Concerns regarding trade policy could raise term premiums further, they said. Growing tariff-related inflation concerns continued to pose a headwind for Treasurys ahead of Tuesday's June CPI data, Metzler said. The June CPI data was unlikely to be a major factor affecting treasury yields, according to Citi. An increase would likely further entrench the Federal Reserve's pause on rates, while a downside inflation surprise would keep the door open for a September rate cut, it said. The 10-year Bund yield fell , shrugging off Trump's announcement of 30% tariffs on the EU starting on Aug. 1. ""The latest tariff threats look set to cause temporary relief in Bunds but are unlikely to reverse the bearish steepening trend,"" Commerzbank said separately. Yields on U.K. government bonds held steady as investors exercised caution. Metals: Gold prices rose as trade tensions drove fears of a global economic slowdown. Futures also rose to their highest level in three weeks. Comex gold futures' upward momentum was likely reaccelerating, RHB Retail Research said. The precious metal should maintain its uptrend toward the $3,450/oz level, it said. Energy:..."

503109E0C7961A718EB0E4A9B1E32197,2025-07-14 11:48:17,en,PRINT,"  Kismet Brewing Company, under new ownership, aims to expand and establish a deeper connection with the Westfield community. Jake and Kerstin Golen are the new owners of Kismet and Jake is now head brewer. Jake, born and raised in Westfield and a graduate of St. Mary's, has been in the beer and restaurant industry for almost 30 years, with his earliest experience coming at Elm Pizza. He has moved throughout the craft beverage industry having worked at Harpoon, Von Trapp, Citizen Cider and Arcpoint Brewing. ""I was doing delivery, then I moved behind the counter, and then I got all my friends hired,"" said Jake with a laugh about his start at Elm Pizza. ""Most recently, I was at Arcpoint in Belchertown and was one of their taproom managers over there. So, I've been doing a lot of this stuff previously in one form or another."" Jake has been homebrewing for multiple years himself and has created recipes he plans to add to Kismet Brewing's selections. While the thought of one day actually opening his own brewery had always been in his mind, Jake did not expect the 66 S. Broad St. location to end up being the home of his brewery once it came on the market. ""I always kind of figured I'd end up with a bar or a brewery, something along those lines. I've always enjoyed with the sales stuff, the front facing stuff where I get to actually talk to people and talk to the customers,"" said Jake. ""It was always one of the high points for me. It was talking to people, why are you drinking? What are you drinking? What do you like about the beer?"" Jake has come in full time and Kerstin is co-owner but still works in Holyoke Public Schools during the school year as a physical therapist. Jake spent the last few months shadowing the previous owners of Kismet to learn the larger scale equipment set up as well as additional recipes in order to have a better grasp of the new commercial-scale brewing he will be a part of. ""Each brewery is a little different in its own way that they make and do their things. Their equipment is different, so even if I went to a different brewery and had kind of the same set up, its still a little different how they would do their stuff,"" said Jake. Kismet has a 5-barrel system which designates it as a microbrewery. Kismet is open Fridays from 4 to 9 p.m. and Saturdays from 1 to 9 p.m. Plans are to soon add Thursday as another night to their hours and potentially add another day based on how things are going this summer. They plan to utilize the outdoor space on the property with tents and local food trucks as well to create more space and a more comfortable outdoor brewery experience. The space is family and dog friendly, as they have no kitchen in the building. ""Our next step, too, is to take some takeout menus for places that will deliver here and have a binder that has all the local delivery places. Obviously, people can DoorDash or Uber Eats whatever they want here, but I wanted to have something that people can be like,  We're just going to order from this local spot.' We want to be Westfield first,"" said Kerstin. With the new space the Golens will also be able to distribute their own product with local sellers and restaurants. ""Our first Friday night, we were pretty busy because a lot of the people I know came in and were like,  Hey congratulations this is awesome.' And I've had regular people come in multiple times now that were regulars before us. Now I have some friends that are coming in to be regulars here as well. I like that even though it's [Westfield] a city it's still like a town."" Jake and Kerstin hope the people of Westfield and surrounding towns come down to the new Kismet Brewery, grab a drink and see what the city's latest small business and brewery has to offer from its pocket of the city. ""We're still very much in a transition period of figuring out what's possible,"" said Kerstin. ""We're on a dead-end street. Nobody is driving down here unless it's for work or something more specific. And I feel like a lot of people in Westfield have no idea we're here,"" said Jake. ""I want to figure out how to get some marketing around, some more visibility, and let people know we're here and we make damn good beers."""

1lzn3xj,2025-07-14 13:58:26,en,REDDIT,"  Hey everyone, I'm dealing with a big dilemma and was hoping to get some advice here. Me and my now ex-girlfriend adopted a malinois back in January. His mother is a malinois but they didn't know what breed the dad was. He looks like the dad might have been a Stafford. I had been pushing back about adopting a dog for a long time because we both have pretty busy lives. Finally I gave in because I knew it would make her happy. I don't know anything about dog breeds and she didn't really consult me before adopting him. I just trusted that she knew what she was doing. I can tell he is bored a lot because almost every day when we get home there is something he destroyed. I'm the one that's going to stay in the house (with small garden) and my ex will probably end up in an apartment. So it makes sense that the dog stays with me. I work a 9-5 job. I can work from home quite a lot but that doesn't mean I have that time to spend with him. I can sneak in short play sessions but I do have to do my job. Besides my daytime job I play in a band and during the summer months (may-september) I'm playing shows almost every weekend. During the winter months it is less but still quite frequently. So on Fridays I can be gone from the morning until very late at night. On Saturdays I can spend some time with him but a lot of times I have to leave early because the shows can be quite far away. Shows on Sundays are rare so I do have time then. I know he loves me very much but I really feel like he deserves so much more in his life than what I can give him. I love him as well, don't get me wrong but like I said before, I've never really wanted a dog because of the reasons above. I know I should've never given in but I just wanted my ex to be happy. So now I don't really know what to do. I really don't want to drop him at an adoption center because he already experienced that once and that would really hurt his trust in humans. I also have no idea what the chances are of him being adopted again and I'm afraid he will be in there for a while. He is super sweet and very smart though! I really don't want to stop playing music. I've already lost the love of my life and that's like the only thing I have left that I love doing. It's probably impossible to know what will be best for him but any thoughts and advice from you guys would really help. Sorry for the long story and thanks in advance!"

1m07r0x,2025-07-15 03:54:07,en,REDDIT,"  It's going to be a long post, and I apologize for it being chaotic and incoherent. I (25m) have some things on my mind, and I honestly don't know what to do in my situation. I am a cradle EO, specifically ROC. I hate to admit it, but often it was not the most pleasant experience (at least this is how my dumb child/teenage brain decided to perceive and capture this). My parents decided to become Orthodox a bit before their marriage and my birth. While I can't really say anything bad about my parents, they raised me good, and they are good people, I feel that they (especially my father) tried to compensate for the lack of religion in their childhood and early adulthood through being a bit too zealous (or not, I am still confused here). I think I started fasting at the age of 7 (not strictly), and during the same age my dad also told me to self-study Old and New Testament (simplified version) and different things about liturgy, clergy, history of the church, etc. Sounds not too bad, but I'm trying to not sound accusing. There are several main reasons why I disliked what happened to me: 1. I had 0 Orthodox friends of my age at any period. Even if there were some kids in my parish, they would be younger, or older, or I would be too shy to speak to them. In school, where I had no trouble with communication, nobody was Orthodox or even religious. Even more, if I tried to talk to some peers about God, I would be laughed at. So eventually I stopped trying (I think at the age of 11). The most embarrassing situation would be at the New Year's party, when other kids eat whatever they want, and I have to abstain or eat fish/vegetables (Christmas is on January 7^(th)). I think it just felt very unfair at the time. 2. During teenage period, when I started using Internet extensively, I've got under the immense amount of anti-religion propaganda, which was not uncommon in Russia. So, even though I didn't know much at the age of 13, I was close to being an atheist. However, I never told anything to my parents. I continued to pray with them twice a day, attending church, fasting on Wednesdays/Fridays, before Communion and during Lents. 3. Sometimes our parish wouldn't be a friendly and welcoming place. Up until 2021 it was just a small (by area) church, serving hundreds (attending) parishioners. It would be OK-ish during summer, but in Moscow freezing winter mornings, when everybody wanted to be inside the building, it would be very tight. Like Japanese subway level of tightness. It wasn't about praying peacefully; it was about being able to breathe. One time I even lost consciousness. 4. Rector of the church was not a bad person, but his way of preaching was very alienating (everybody in my family admitted it). It wasn't about, you know, love, salvation, but it was more about vice exposure. Not direct, or personal, it was just aimed at the parishioners. 5. We would usually go to the Liturgy that starts at 7am, meaning that we would wake up at 6am on Sunday. I wasn't very strong physically, so attending liturgy was always a challenge. I hate to say that, but my favorite priest was the one whose liturgy was just 1 hour (excluding the Matins). The point is that I didn't really care during the Liturgy, I wasn't praying. (even though I knew exactly what was going on, which ectenias are read at the moment, etc.) 6. Daily prayers and annual reading of the New Testament during the Great Lent were always perceived as exhausting and automatic. I know many prayers by heart, but I've rarely sincerely prayed. When I reached 21, I decided to rent my own place, and I moved relatively far away from my family. I didn't have any disagreement with my parents; it was due to very secular reasons. After that, I stopped praying and mostly stopped attending church. I only went during big holidays, just feeling some kind of a cultural Orthodoxy. Even though when I was a teenager, I was opposed to the organized religion, I think I never lost faith in God (in Orthodox sense). The worst part is that I started lying to my parents. Lying that I attend church every Sunday, that I fast, that I am a practicing Orthodox Christian. One year ago, I moved to the US, to a relatively large Midwestern city...."

The Lobby Bar, 100 W. Michigan Ave., will open its doors today. It'll serve drinks and light fare from 3 to 9 p.m. Tuesdays though Thursdays and 3 to 10 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. The bar is designed to welcome hotel guests after a day of travel, said Ryan Cunningham, Greenleaf Hospitality's executive director of food and beverage, but it's open to anyone. ""On a Friday afternoon, you'll see a line at the front desk (of) people checking in,"" he said. ""We wanted a space for them to invite them in for more of a casual bite."" A bar and small tables fill the intimate, dimly lit space. The decor and drinks are ""sophisticated,"" but not formal or ""edgy,"" Cunningham said. ""We're not going to get too wild and crazy,"" Cunningham said. ""We're going to make really damn good cocktails."" The Lobby Bar's curated beverage menu features classic cocktails like the Cosmopolitan and Manhattan, made with ingredients from Michigan-based distilleries. Equidistant, the Lobby Bar's espresso martini, is made with espresso from Kalamazoo's Factory Coffee and spirits from Grand Rapids distillery Eastern Kille. The cocktails are classic in substance, but carry creative connection to the city in name. The ""Checker'ed Past"" whiskey sour, $14, is a nod to the iconic yellow taxi cabs that were manufactured in Kalamazoo. ""I've Got a Gal,"" a $13 cosmopolitan, pays homage to the 1942 Glenn Miller song, ""(I've Got a Gal in) Kalamazoo."" ""When people travel, they want to know a little bit about where they are,"" Cunningham said. ""We wanted to showcase what the community offers."" Beer, wine and nonalcoholic cocktails are also available. The small bites menu offers nine options, from popcorn topped with truffle oil, sea salt, Parmesan and chives for $8 to the Szechuan-glazed pork belly bites served with Asian slaw & pickles for $16. Lobby Bar sits in the former home of RIO gift shop, inside the Radisson lobby. RIO will reopen as a grab-and-go Amazon storefront in the space later this summer, Cunningham said. Old Burdick's Bar & Grill, the sports bar also housed in the hotel, is expected to reopen this fall after a monthslong renovation. Nearby, the Kalamazoo Event Center construction speeds toward a fall 2027 opening. ""A lot of what we're doing here is really prepping us for the future when the event center comes,"" Cunningham said. ""We're just getting ready."""

Book: ""Everyone Is Lying To You"" by Jo Piazza    Publishing Info: Dutton, July 2025    Where Did I Get This Book: I received an ARC at ALAAC25. Where You Can Get This Book: WorldCat.org | Amazon | Indiebound    Book Description: Lizzie and Bex were best friends in college. After graduation, Bex vanished, leaving Lizzie confused and devastated. Fifteen years later, Bex is now Rebecca Sommers, a “traditional” Instagram influencer with millions of followers who salivate over her perfect life on her ranch with her five children and handsome husband, Gray. Lizzie is a struggling magazine writer, watching reels while her young children demand her attention. One night out of the blue, Bex calls Lizzie with a career-making proposition—an exclusive interview with her about her multimillion-dollar business venture and an invitation to MomBomb, the high-profile influencing conference. At the conference, Bex goes missing and Gray is found brutally murdered on their ranch. Lizzie finds herself plunged into the dark side of the cutthroat world of social media that includes jealousy, sordid affairs, swingers, and backstabbing. She must learn who her old friend has become and who she has double-crossed to try to find her, clear her name, and maybe even save her life. Piazza's master storytelling and razor-sharp insight into the world of social media brings us a pulpy, juicy, and cleverly plotted read that will have you guessing all the way through and leave you gasping for more. Review: Thank you to Dutton for giving me an ARC at ALAAC25! In recent years we have seen an uptick in 'tradwife' content online. For those unaware, tradwife influencers generally create content surrounding traditional family values, homemaking, motherhood, and pushing a conservative (and oftentimes far-right) agenda. It's interesting seeing it play out as our societal Overton Window in the U.S. has shifted further right, making these influencers centerpieces of aspirational 'and you can be an ideal traditional housewife and mother too!' content, even though by being incredibly successful (and certainly monetized) influencers they are already not following the 'be a submissive homemaker' ideal they are pushing but being the actual breadwinner who supports their families with their content creation more than many of their husbands do. This kind of stuff fascinates and unsettles me, and when I heard that Jo Piazza had a tradwife centered murder mystery coming out called ""Everyone Is Lying To You"" I knew that I HAD to read it. And man, it was great. At the heart of ""Everyone Is Lying To You"" are two women, who are both wives and mothers and who were best friends in college but lost touch for years. We have Lizzie, a determined journalist who works for a women's publication, but has been struggling to adjust to working passion and becoming a mother to two children with a newly unemployed husband (who is supportive and great but a little aimless). The other is Rebecca, formerly Bex, who is a very popular family influencer who shows off her perfect marriage on a sprawling ranch while she raises six kids and homesteads with her traditional and conservative husband Gray. Rebecca reaches out to Lizzie promising her a juicy story if she attends the biggest female/family centered influencer convention, and while they are there Bex disappears and Gray is murdered on the ranch. We follow Lizzie's perspective as she tries to figure out if her friend is a murderer whilst also fending off gossipy and perhaps cutthroat influencers, finding pieces of the puzzle and hoping to clear Bex while also wondering if she is actually a murderer. Piazza has some solid pacing, some really well done reveals and twists, and has so many misdirects and suspects that I really was kept guessing for most of the story. Hell, it was so well done that I didn't even roll my eyes at any of the more out there reveals, as the story itself was so strong that it was easily forgivable. The mystery of a murder and tradwife influencers is great, and I was already fully in, but it's the two women we are following that really made this story a true knockout for me. I found Lizzie to be incredibly relatable, as a woman who never really took to the motherly instincts that we are told we all have, and who feels frazzled and sometimes overwhelmed by her family and the expectations that come with being a mom even if she really really loves every bit of her kids and her husband. But it was Rebecca/Bex that really shined, as we slowly learn her story through her perspective chapters and how she has ended up incredibly famous, while hiding so many of the darker aspects of her life because it would hurt the brand she has built around herself, and because she doesn't want the world to know what her husband is really like. It was pretty clear to me that a lot of the inspiration for her was from Hannah Neeleman, aka Ballerina Farm (if you want a summary of the really insidious undertones of Hannah and her creepy husband's vision, Jordan and McKay have a GREAT breakdown as former Mormons who have a lot of insight, or a REALLY deep dive from Fundie Fridays that postulates it's pure Christian Nationalist propaganda), and Piazza makes Rebecca incredibly easy to root for while also making it hard to know if she could be capable of murder. I loved Rebecca's chapters and wanted the best for her, even when I didn't know if she was a killer or not. In instances like this I'm down to support women's rights AND wrongs. (source)    And finally, Piazza clearly knows her stuff when it comes to influencers and tradwife Internet/media content, because she knows all the ins, outs, controversies, and hypocrisies and finds ways to showcase them front and center. Whether it's women who peddle wellness lifestyles while doing not so healthy things off camera, or mommy influencers who hide their nannies from the camera, or women who feel like they have to promote really exploitative things, usually at their children's expense, for clicks and engagement, this book tackles a LOT and makes it snappy, cutting, and incredibly engaging. It's such a great deconstruction of all the hypocritical and damaging things that tradwife content promotes as ideal, and I savored every bit of it. ""Everyone Is Lying To You"" is a fast and addictive thriller with a bit of satirical bite to it. It's a surefire winner for summer reading, and I really, really loved it. Rating 9: I mean this book was basically written for me and all of my special interests and I was totally absorbed by all of it. PERFECT summer reading. Reader's Advisory:    ""Everyone Is Lying To You"" is included on the Goodreads list ""Fiction About Influencers""."

n39bksa,2025-07-15 13:34:31,en,REDDIT,"  Schedules and outsourcing! I'm an attorney with a 1 and 4 year old. I work in the office T/W/Th. I usually leave at 8 am, get home around 6. We eat dinner (we eat out on T/W/Th to make life easier re cooking). We do a mix of Hello Fresh and groceries for other days (and eat out when we don't want to cook). For bed time, my wife and I rotate. I put our 1 year old to bed M/F/Sat/Sun (7 pm bed time) and my 4 year old T/W/Th who goes down between 8-8:30. We do bath nights T/Th/Sat but are flexible and if we are active do more (ie sweat and sunscreen). I wake up at 5 am with my 1 year old and we hang out / I drink coffee. 4 year old comes down at 6ish and watches cartoons. My wife is not a morning person and comes down around 6:30/7. I take the kids to daycare / preschool (two stops) around 7:45 on M/F and pick up around 5/5:30. Wife does drop off / pick up T/W/Th and goes into the office on one of those days (rest is remote). The days I do pick up, she cooks Hello Fresh at home. We eat around 6 pm every day. On Fridays, I get “game nights” and play games with my buddies and stay up late, my wife does mornings Saturday. On Sunday, my wife gets her time. She goes to a Pilates class, goes and grabs an iced coffee and hangs out in a bougie area. We do a mix of memberships (Children's museum, Zoo, science museum) and parks on the weekend. We also just went to Chuck E Cheese, which has great games for a 4 year old / rides for a 1 year old and is $30 for unlimited play for an hour (good summer time activity). For wife time, we hang out in the evenings when we wind down, and we try and do a date night at least monthly. We just went to a burlesque show to support one of our friends on Saturday, but we try not to stay out too late as 5 am wake up is brutal if you go to bed at midnight. I also buy her a lot of “fun” clothing from my Nordstrom targeted ads on social media, and we do a lot of fashion try one. This includes some more suggestive nighties, swimsuits, and lingerie. We do have a rooftop deck and hot tub, so I sometimes set up a movie night with champagne etc and we watch out there (my first job was a pool boy, so not too painful to maintain). Sex life is pretty great (4-5 times on average, a mix of during the day when we both wFh and on nights she doesn't put my son to bed as she is definitely an 8 hour person). We do spot cleaning, but I outsourced it for $300 every couple weeks. Same for the yard. I do pickup groceries for fruit / milk and then scheduled Amazon delivery for pouches etc. We hit up Costco one a month for diapers and restocking on big stuff (chuck E cheese and chik fila are by ours). That's about if off the top of my head. You obviously have to be flexible with a schedule, but we try our best to stick to it for predictability."
mov_C07594B6406FDE0E9B9E6151886A8FFD,2025-07-15 15:48:55,en,WEB,"  This year, C3 Solutions celebrates 25 years of operation in the yard management and dock scheduling software industry. Though operating in a competitive industry, C3 Solutions has achieved sustainable growth and technological leadership, and the company attributes this continued success to its culture. Rather than some byproduct of their development, culture stands as the drive behind the company's story. Creating a Culture That Lasts Since the company was founded in 2000, C3 Solutions has maintained a notable distinction in its industry—a high employee retention rate. The world of supply chain and logistics technology is naturally fast-paced and volatile, but the company has dedicated itself to investing in the people who make innovation possible. While competitors come and go, C3 Solutions continues to thrive. “Our success is deeply rooted in our people-first approach,” C3 Solutions CEO Nicolas Couture says. “We have always believed that creating an environment where employees feel truly valued directly translates into outstanding results and long-term resilience.” The C3 House: Building Community Nowhere is C3 Solutions' commitment to company culture better reflected than the aptly named “C3 House.” Serving as the company's headquarters, the C3 House promotes creativity, innovation, and community-building—in many ways, the space actively manifests the company's values. However, C3 Solutions' company culture is not limited to its headquarters. Its commitment to its people is represented in initiatives such as the Month of Well-Being, stress management conferences, and the Green Committee. At the same time, employees benefit from perks like Summer Fridays, voluntary work days, and a four-week abroad work policy. These advantages have led the average employee to stay with C3 Solutions longer than many of its competitors, demonstrating the importance of community satisfaction. “The C3 House is a revolutionary concept,” chief revenue officer Greg Braun states. “By integrating flexibility, personalized workspace solutions, and promoting holistic well-being through activities like company gym sessions and regular team events, we've created a hybrid model that enhances both collaboration and employee satisfaction.” Driven by Mutual Growth Culture-driven initiatives such as these have enabled C3 Solutions and its leadership to build a unique community within the logistics industry. The company's team puts adaptability, transparency, and mutual respect first, and these values have empowered each of its members to grow and change without straying from their collective mission to deliver innovative and scalable solutions. The company states, “Our culture is not merely a perk. It is the foundation that allows us to continuously innovate, retain top talent, and build long-term client relationships.” A Partner for Success Company culture and commitment have allowed C3 Solutions to become a trusted partner to some of the largest and most complex logistics operations in the world, but for its employees, the company represents an opportunity to be a voice that matters. This is why, for more than two decades, the company has been a home for problem-solvers and collaborators who succeed. Looking to the future, C3 Solutions hopes to take this moment not only to look back on where the company has been, but as an inspiration for the future. By focusing on its culture of trust, resilience, and creativity, C3 Solutions actively positions itself as an industry leader."

An EOS Cashmere Body Oil so silky and glow-inducing, your skin will literally look like it hopped off at hydration station. This lightweight formula melts in like butter (minus the grease), locks in moisture for 24 hours, and leaves behind a subtle yet delectable scent of ""Vanilla Cashmere."" Oh — and plot twist? That's the same scent as the internet-famous EOS lotion everyone's obsessed with. Promising review: ""I love the scent of this body oil, it wasn't too oily, it made my skin softer, it wasn't greasy at all and it's an excellent value for the money. I will definitely be buying more in the near future."" —Delina Flowers Price: $12.99 2. A dainty pair of bow earrings that'll have people asking ""OMG, where'd you get those?"" every time you wear them. Available in gold and silver, these cuties are the perfect mix of trendy and timeless — and they're under $15... a steal, IMO. Promising review: ""Obsessed!! These earrings are so stinkin' cute! They are the perfect size — not too big, but not too small, either. For my ears they didn't feel heavy to wear all day. I just love them!!"" —Danielle Sharp Furlow Price: $12.99 (available in three styles) 3. A pair of retro-inspired oval sunglasses if you want to wear a signature Miu Miu sunglass style without paying designer prices. These petite, trendy frames are giving ""celebrity in hiding"" energy, complete with UV protection and a lightweight feel. You may catch yourself wearing these at any chance you get when it's sunny out (you've been warned). Promising review: ""I bought these sunglasses because they're very trendy right now, but I didn't want to dish out an exorbitant amount of money because the frame isn't my usual. They block out the sun better than my designer sunglasses. I'm glad I bought them because they are extremely sturdy, just as pictured, and (actually?) they frame my face very nicely!"" —Addie Price: $15.99+ for two pairs (available in 29 colors and various packs) 4. A bladeless neck fan for when it's so hot you're considering becoming nocturnal. This bladeless, hands-free fan wraps around your neck and sends out a cool breeze in all directions — without messing up your hair or sounding like a jet engine. It's rechargeable, lightweight, and has different speed settings so you can control your personal chill zone as you're commuting, walking the dog, or just trying to survive summer. Promising review: ""This arrived quickly, love the color, had NO chemical or new plastic fumes, already had a bit of a charge to test it before charging it fully. I must say both [my husband and I] are impressed with the amount of power it has on all [three] settings. The sound isn't too loud for my senses, and I actually enjoy the fan sound, as it's quite soothing in a crowded space. Looking forward to having some much needed breeze relief throughout the summer!"" —Linda Price: $23.98+ (available in eight colors) 5. A hydrating E.l.f. lip balm which feels just as buttery soft as Laneige *and* has the same glossy finish to boot. It *also* comes in yummy flavors like Vanilla Frosting, Strawberry, and Honeydew and leaves a sheer tint of color — it's the perfect lil' treat for your lips! BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord had this to say: ""I love love love this lip balm. I compare it to the $24 version from Summer Fridays, which I've been splurging on — I love that brand because it lasts so long and is so high quality, but this $4 E.l.f. version feels comparable and, more excitingly, comes in smaller versions so I can stock my totes and bathroom with them whether I'm at home or on the go. It's hydrating, lightweight, doesn't get sticky, and adds a perfect ~subtle~ gloss whether I'm using it alone or on top of a lip color. I love the vanilla flavor so much, it's got a similar vibe to the birthday cake flavor that Glossier sometimes carries."" Promising review: ""I have one in my car, one in my purse, and one at home. These just feel so good on your lips!..."

The business will be open 3 to 10 p.m. on Fridays and noon to 10 p.m. Saturday and Sunday, with live acoustic music at 6 p.m. each night. The cordoned off lounge area will be filled with casual seating options and customers will order at the counter, similar to existing Batch locations in Kitsilano and the Plaza of Nations in downtown Vancouver. People in the Ambleside community have been calling for something just like this, said Maureen O'Brien, executive director of the Ambleside and Dundrave Business Improvement Association. “A survey that we did had 76 per cent … saying they would like a brewery or taproom in Ambleside, and that they want more activation on the water,” she said. “Someplace to just stop and have beer, something that brings some energy to Ambleside, something that's a bit more youthful.” Batch is currently booked for an eight-week pilot wrapping up on the Sept. 12 weekend, but that could be extended if things go well, O'Brien said. “If it works great, we can continue to do these kinds of things. And if it didn't, well, no harm in trying,” she said. “It's what people have been asking for. I mean, we have such beautiful, beautiful waterfront, and it's just so underutilized.” Hockey player turns business owner The new location is a full-circle moment for Batch founder John Negrin, who grew up in West Vancouver. Negrin, a former professional hockey player, was selected by the Calgary Flames in the 2007 NHL Draft, but spent most of his career playing in the American Hockey League. Since retiring from pro hockey in 2020, he's been involved with several businesses. He founded the first Batch location in August 2022 in the Plaza of Nations, and opened the second Kits location in June 2024. So far, Batch has been a hit. “It's going well,” he said. “It's just about creating a good space. At both locations that we have, there's a good energy. So we tend to be busy.” There's live music and it's free to enter, Negrin said. “So a lot of people just love coming out and catching some local artists,” he said. And he keeps all the product selection local to B.C. “We want to try to create a place where local brands can have some exposure, and people can try some of the different beers from the breweries,” Negrin said. While the 36 year old has spent most of his adult life on the ice, being a business owner is more his speed, he said. “It took time to get here, but I feel like it's a really nice place to be,” Negrin said. “I'm excited to be back in West Vancouver. It's nice to actually just be spending time here. It's beautiful,” he said. Negrin added that he's grateful to the district for stepping outside the box and allowing the pilot. “I'm looking forward to continuing this partnership and making something that's memorable for everybody,” he said.

It's no secret that many of the stars have undergone dramatic makeovers to prepare for their time in the limelight, but that's just one optional part of the journey. The actual audition process is incredibly rigorous, with numerous hoops to jump through. The first - and arguably least glamorous - step involves filling out an application form detailing your preferences, likes and dislikes, along with any intriguing titbits about yourself. Following this, you're tasked with creating a 60-second video to grab the casting team's attention. Amy Hart, a Season 5 Islander, shared her audition tape on YouTube, which was a rapid-fire rundown of her accomplishments and snippets from her day job, interspersed with plenty of direct-to-camera chat. In contrast, Season 7's Millie Court opted for a different tactic, splitting her video between casual conversation and footage from her nights out. Hopeful Islanders who impress with their videos are then invited for a phone audition, followed by either a Zoom call or an in-person interview. During this stage, applicants sit across from producers and are filmed while answering a series of questions, reports OK! During the tenth anniversary special of Love Island, titled Decade of Love, interviews from a host of now-iconic past Islanders were unveiled to the public for the first time. Molly-Mae revealed that a former partner found her ""too much to handle"", while Chris Hughes offered an extensive guide on his hair styling routine. TikToker Summer Fox previously shared her journey through the selection process. She reached the face-to-face interview stage, where she was instructed to dress as if going for a date. Upon arrival, she joined a group of other hopefuls, all dressed up and waiting for their individual meetings with the producers. She remembered: ""They look at you like you're a new person walking in, like judging and it feels like you were back at school again. Love Island fans can catch all the action from the new season when outside the UK with ExpressVPN. The service is available on laptops, smartphones, tablets and other devices running Windows, Mac, Android and iOS. ""You all go into this canteen room and sit down and you have to fill in the forms. It'll ask you what's something secret that not one knows that you've done and I think those are what they use later on in the show in the challenges."" Advice for a successful application varies. According to Biggs Chris from Season 6, the key is to ""have fun and flirt with the person casting,"" while Scott Thomas from Season 2 suggested Love Island hopefuls should ""wear their heart on their sleeve.""

The night before three of the top cast members, whose characters are in a love triangle on the weepy teen saga, talked to The Tonight Show about which one will end up with beauty Isabel 'Belly' Conklin. The stars of the hit show are Lola Tung (as Belly), Gavin Casalegno (who plays Jeremiah) and Christopher Briney (who stars as brooding hunk Conrad). 'Season 2 ended with a major cliffhanger. This was a big deal. I mean, your character, Belly, chose Jeremiah over Conrad,' Jimmy Fallon said  before asking Tung what she thought about that ending. 'I'm all for her following her heart,' the actress shared as she said she was 'Team Belly.' Belly was careful to not give any secretive plot details away. She continued: 'And she's doing what she needs to do in the moment, and following her heart in that moment and in every moment.' In a snippet shared during the show, viewers see Belly watching Jeremiah play Twister when Conrad calls him. Jeremiah asks Belly to answer and she and Conrad have an awkward exchange. When asked about Season 3, Tung said, 'I think it's a lot more of the emotional rollercoaster you're used to, I guess, and also, you know, there's a little time jump, so we meet the characters in a little bit of a more mature place, I think.' Season three takes place four years after season two ended. While on The Tonight Show Tung wore a John Galliano for Dior corset dress from a 2001 collection, along with a pair of 2013 Dior Mary Jane pumps as she accessorized with Panconesi earrings. In a trailer for the show's third and final season, Conrad is seen asking Belly's best friend Taylor (played by Rain Spencer) for advice about his plan to come back into Belly's life. It's clear he is ready to win her over again. The first two episodes of season 3 of The Summer I Turned Pretty will premiere on Prime Video on Wednesday, July 16. Season three will consist of 10 episodes. The program, which had viewers crying hard enough to give themselves migraines, has become one of Amazon Prime Video's most popular shows. Amazon and MGM Studios' head of television, Vernon Sanders, issued a statement to elaborate on the success of the coming-of-age series. 'We've been delighted to see the passion with which fans have embraced The Summer I Turned Pretty, making Summer Fridays an entertainment phenomenon,' he said. Sanders went on to speak about how The Summer I Turned Pretty, which was created by Jenny Han, had quickly become a fan-favorite program. 'This charming, deeply heartfelt series has shown the breadth of our customer base, appealing to a young, diverse set of viewers. Jenny Han is a gifted storyteller, whose fans have been clamoring for the third chapter of this story,' he stated. The Summer I Turned Pretty is based on Han's book of the same name, which was originally released in 2009. The book was followed up by a pair of sequels that were published in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The series is centered on Isabel 'Belly' Conklin, a teenage girl who ends up in a love triangle with a pair of brothers."
mov_849790C88FABBAD5702FB378A452BEC4,2025-07-16 23:58:19,en,WEB,"  BBB: Hassle-free online purchase returns Published: Jul. 16, 2025 at 6:58 PM CDT|Updated: seconds ago CAPE GIRARDEAU, Mo. (KFVS) - Prime Days 2025 raked in a record-breaking $24 billion in just four days, according to Amazon officials. Those with Adobe Analytics say that total is comparable to more than two black Fridays' worth of spending. Whether it was a Prime Day purchase or a summer sale snag, those with the Better Business Bureau say there are ways to make returning online orders easier. Regional director Sydney Waters said the first thing to know is that policies vary widely by store. “In the United States, we don't have any set parameters of return policies that businesses have to adhere to, so it's really up to you to do your research and know all those policies before you purchase.” Waters said most consumer complaints she sees are about shoppers not reading the store's policy first. “There's not a blanket policy that they have to refund your money, return your item, anything like that, so that fine print is very, very important to you as a consumer.” Things like reshipping and restocking fees can differ from business to business. Some retailers also consider a customer ineligible for their return policy if they are paying in installments. When there's doubt about the store's return policy, Waters said not to be afraid to use the customer service line to find answers. If there's no customer service line or way to contact the seller, or no listed return policy, Waters said that could be a red flag the transaction is not legitimate. Impersonation sites pretending to be a real brand do exist. “Check those URLs, check that domain, see how long that website has been active, if it's brand new and it just popped up, it's probably a scam.” Waters said people will sometimes report not being able to return an item to the BBB looking for help. However, the organization can't do anything for someone who technically had the information available to them and chose not to read it."

The Cooling Bus, driven by former CRAB Park residents, operates three days a week, visiting parks and streets across the DTES and Strathcona. CLICK HERE TO LISTEN TO 1130 NEWSRADIO VANCOUVER LIVE! Every Cooling Bus staff member is trained through the 'Street Degree' overdose prevention program, including Kiana McDermott, a former CRAB Park resident. “It was definitely some of the hardest times of my life, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy,” said McDermott. She explains that Downtown Eastside temperatures can feel 10 to 15 degrees hotter than reported, making cooling services critical for survival. “Heat stroke is a very real thing, and we're trying to prevent that.” The bus is stocked with oranges, water bottles, snacks, and naloxone kits, as well as a bunch of other useful items for people who need them most. Its operators took CityNews along for a stop at Oppenheimer Park. Reflecting on her time in CRAB Park, McDermott says getting food and water was a struggle. She says the initiative is vital, not just for those using the service, but for herself as well. “Having people do what I'm doing right now has helped me come out of the places and the darkness where I was.” The Cooling Bus seats 14 people and is equipped with air conditioning. It operates Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m."

Eos Marshmallow ""Super Balm"" lip treatment from the brand's ""secret menu"" so good that reviewers say it's better than Carmex for healing and better than Summer Fridays for quality. Lip care that also tastes like you're perpetually eating a s'more for less than $5?? My friends, life is good. Check out a TikTok of the marshmallow lip treatment in action. Promising review: ""My new must-have! My number one go-to for healing lips was Carmex. This beat it. I love the consistency (very creamy/smooth), it's not heavily flavored or goopy, and it obviously smells amazing. It isn't overbearing and also doesn't keep coating your mouth like the Eos stick balms (still great, but more wax)."" —Breanah Shirazi Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (also available in Strawberry Acai). 2. A container of Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cinnadust so absurdly delicious that all food will just become a mere canvas for putting Cinnadust on. Reviewers use this on everything from coffee to toast to yogurt to fries to popcorn to sweet potatoes to ice cream to — you know what, I'll let you decide on your cinnajourney for yourself. Check out a TikTok of the Cinnadust in action. Promising review: ""We absolutely love using this in our morning coffee.

mov_67118130E7A215ED23B1511CA0119710,2025-07-17 11:30:00,en,WEB,"  Priya Krishnan is Chief Digital and Transformation Officer at Bright Horizons. During the school year, most working parents have figured out a childcare schedule for their children while they work. This all changes for the two to three months when kids are on summer break, and managing their children's schedules can be a full-time job for parents. A KPMG study on childcare-related disruptions says lack of help with care “results in millions of lost work hours.” This has a huge impact on employees, both personally and professionally, and on bottom lines. A recent survey we conducted with The Harris Poll revealed that 68% of working parents agree that summer feels like a break for everyone but them. These parents are spending time trying to find childcare, camps and extracurricular activities to keep their children engaged and entertained throughout the summer while they're at work. This additional stress can have negative impacts on their ability to work productively as they try to balance work and family responsibilities. Moreover, parents are worried about the lack of structure for their children or are concerned with “brain rot” if they do not put enough effort into planning their children's schedules. So, it's understandable why parents are overwhelmingly concerned about filling those summer months with beneficial, age-appropriate activities and/or care. Why should businesses care about the matter? Workplace Productivity As I learned from our survey, most parents' level of focus at work in the summer is directly tied to how reliable their children's summer schedules are. Not to mention, parents experience a variety of challenges while their children are at home during the summer that affect their focus, including interruptions (e.g., receiving texts/phone calls) or, if they're old enough to stay at home alone, an emotional and mental strain about what the children are doing. Not surprisingly, most working parents wish their employers offered more support to help them arrange a reliable summer schedule for their children. An increasing number of employees, especially working parents, are looking to their employers to provide these types of benefits, both financial as well as access to resources, to alleviate these time-consuming searches that affect not only their peace of mind but also their productivity. So, how can businesses help? How Can Businesses Help? Some organizations are helping working parents solve the summer schedule dilemma and are getting creative in figuring out ways of doing so. For example, we helped AT&T with a new summer camp program, which they are piloting at their home office this year. According to the company's Assistant Vice President of Benefits, AT&T has held focus groups and listening sessions to hear about workers' childcare challenges, and one concern he and his colleagues heard, “loud and clear,” was that “summers are hard.” While employer-sponsored programs like on- or off-site child care and camp programs are benefits that can go a long way with working parents, there are other supports that can help as well. Some additional lower-lift options include simply allowing a more flexible schedule so parents can work around drop-offs and pickups, offering summer Fridays off and the general recognition that some work can get done beyond the typical ""work day."" Here are a few first steps an organization can take to help solve the summer schedule dilemma: • Identify needs. Listen to employee resource group feedback and/or conduct a survey to learn about what your employees really need in terms of support. • Consider offering a ""Benefits 2.0"": Look for ways to support your teams that are not part of your traditional benefits offerings. Think outside the box to come up with creative solutions. • Partner with external experts: Look for resources and partners who can offer easy-to-implement solutions. Organizations must regularly reassess their support systems to accommodate the evolving needs of their employees. Ultimately, by doing so, they will see returns in the form of a more motivated and stable workforce."
mov_BE816FD69329E7B351A44ACAAB638356,2025-07-17 14:24:19,en,WEB,"  Toronto in the summer is great, but sometimes you just need to get out of the city for a few days, breathe in some fresh air, and remind yourself that peace and quiet actually do exist. Whether you're looking to hike through hidden trails, explore small-town charm, or just eat your way through a cute village, these long weekend getaways from Toronto will do the trick. Here are five underrated spots that are perfect for a summer escape — all within reasonable driving distance from the city. Mono Cliffs Provincial Park If you're itching for a nature escape that feels like you're way farther from the city than you actually are, Mono Cliffs is it. Tucked away in the Niagara Escarpment, this provincial park is packed with scenic hiking trails, dramatic cliff views, and photo-worthy boardwalks winding through rock crevices and forests. The best part? It's usually way less crowded than places like Algonquin or Bruce Peninsula. Pro tip: Make a stop in nearby Orangeville for coffee and snacks before or after your hike. LaiQuicAnh/Shutterstock Erin Erin is giving big “Hallmark movie village” energy, but without the snow or the scripted romance. This tiny town is full of charming boutiques, antique shops, and cozy cafes. If you're into leisurely strolls, browsing artisan goods, and living your best cottagecore life for a day, Erin's got you covered. Must do: grab lunch at The Busholme or check out the Erin Farmers Market (Fridays during the summer). Town of Erin Port Hope & Northumberland County This is one of those spots that somehow still feels like a hidden gem, even though it's just off the 401. Port Hope is a picturesque riverside town with antique stores, cute cafes, and a historic main street that's basically made for Instagram. If you're up for exploring, Northumberland County offers hiking, scenic drives, and even a beach day at Cobourg. Don't miss: Ganaraska Forest for a hike or a chill afternoon by the river downtown. R.C. Hamilton/Shutterstock Point Pelee National Park If you're down for a bit more of a drive, Point Pelee is the ultimate nature-lover's getaway. It's the southernmost point in mainland Canada, and the park is filled with marshes, forests, and boardwalks that feel straight out of a nature documentary. It's also a major bird migration hotspot if you're into birdwatching (or just pretending to be). Fun fact: you can literally walk to the tip of Canada. KeatsPhotos/Shutterstock Village of Merrickville-Wolford This place is often called “the Jewel of the Rideau,” and for good reason. Merrickville is a storybook village full of 19th-century architecture, quaint shops, and a surprisingly vibrant arts scene. It's the kind of place where you'll buy handcrafted soap, eat homemade fudge, and seriously consider moving there on the spot. Add to your list: take a boat ride along the Rideau Canal or explore nearby artisanal distilleries and breweries. Mike Workman/Shutterstock Whether you've got a packed itinerary or just want to unplug for a few days, these five getaways offer a little something for everyone. And the best part? No plane ticket required. So pack your snacks, queue up your road trip playlist, and hit the road before the summer slips away."

I just wanna point out in the beginning that my face didn't look like this two days ago. I never go in the sun and I went out in the sun just for 30 minutes and I got absolutely burnt. Please look at the last photo so you could see the sunburn on my chest. I have no idea why I have all these dark patches in my face just looks absolutely dirty and it's not I'm gonna go home and take off my make up and post another picture. It started about three months ago, where I had that patch of hyper pigmentation on my forehead. I feel that things have been getting darker. This is my skin care regimen.

However, yesterday I was in the sun for only 30 minutes and I got burnt on my chest, my shoulders and my face Obviously the SPF maybe was not enough. I get very burnt when I'm in the sun and I'm just so scared about what's happening to my face. I'm freaking out. I never have these dark spots and taking these photos in the actual light is really scary. I don't know why everything is getting darker when I'm trying to get things lighter. I have some foundation on that I put on at 7 am this morning . It's 6 pm. I know I'm burnt from the sun yesterday but I would just be red . Why does my skin  have dark patches everywhere . It started with only my forehead and above my right eyebrow ...."

For those of you who are new to this, First Lines Fridays is a weekly post  hosted by Wandering Words. In this post instead of judging a book by its cover, its author or its prestige, we judged it by its opening lines. To do this simply:     Pick a book off your shelf (it could be your current read or on your TBR) and open to the first page    Copy the first few lines, but don't give anything else about the book away just yet – you need to hook the reader first    Finally… reveal the book! So without further ado, let's get going! FIRST LINES:     ""I love Thursday nights. They have a feel to them that's outside time. It's our tradition, just the three of us – family night. My son, Charlie, is sitting at the table, drawing on a sketch pad. He's almost fifteen. The kid grew two inches over the summer, and he's as tall as I am now/""    DO YOU RECOGNISE WHICH BOOK THESE LINES COME FROM? THIS WEEKS BOOK IS…         Synopsis/Blurb (Taken from Goodreads):    ""'Are you happy in your life?' Those are the last words Jason Dessen hears before the masked abductor knocks him unconscious. Before he awakes to find himself strapped to a gurney, surrounded by strangers in hazmat suits. Before the man he's never met smiles down at him and says, 'Welcome back.' In this world he's woken up to, Jason's life is not the one he knows. His wife is not his wife. His son was never born. And Jason is not an ordinary college physics professor, but a celebrated genius who has achieved something remarkable. Something impossible. Is it this world or the other that's the dream? And even if the home he remembers is real, how can Jason possibly make it back to the family he loves? The answers lie in a journey more wondrous and horrifying than anything he could've imagined - one that will force him to confront the darkest parts of himself even as he battles a terrifying, seemingly unbeatable foe."" Happy Reading!!! You can also find me on: Twitter || Instagram ||Goodreads"

I'm currently working on my 12th book, which is nowhere near the amount I typically read, but I still think it's decent. Hey Everyone     As you know, I've been trying a new thing for me, where I share a book I love and provide a free ebook link to it, if possible. This novel was released last June, and it is the highest I rated this month, with four stars. It wasn't on my TBR, but it fitted the prompt. On the other hand, the cover is gorgeous, the perfect summer read. Funnily, I read the blurb in a way that I thought one of the main characters was a bookgrammer, but it turns out the author is. We meet Asher and Theo. Asher and his boyfriend signed up for a reality show similar to The Amazing Race, but his boyfriend broke up with him last minute, leaving him heartbroken and without a teammate to compete with. Enter the bet over mozzarella sticks. Theo is a pilot who was ordered by HR to take a vacation since he had flown too many hours as a classic workaholic. Buried fears and emotions were uncovered. First Lines:      “I'm sorry, Asher…but I can't go on this trip—”      “I' The last words I expected to hear coming out of my long-term boyfriend's mouth at the airline ticket counter. After months of meticulous planning—countless hours of my life I will never get back, painstakingly stressing over cost-analysis documents and packing lists and risk waivers— this was the one travel hiccup I could not have thought to plan for. “Did you forget to pack something?” I ask, lining up my luggage as I try to visualize the now-packed to-do list I've been ticking items off from one by one. “There's definitely still time to head back home…” But when I turn back toward him, there's something about the way his overplucked eyebrows are pinched together that tells me a different departure is on the horizon. Goodreads Blurb:     opular bookstagrammer Chip Pons's gay rom-com about two men who impulsively pose as a couple to compete in a reality show contest just minutes after meeting at an airport, and their run-in with the very real feelings that start to simmer between them. Catching flights...& feelings...has never been more complicated. Asher Bennet thought his relationship was just fine. Until he's unceremoniously dumped at the Boston airport ahead of the world-wide travel competition reality show, The Epic Trek. Armed with only a ticket and righteous indignation, Asher finds the closest solace he can: a mimosa and mozzarella sticks combo at an airport TGI Fridays. Still, Asher is determined to find a new partner and luckily, right in front of him is a smooth-talking airline pilot ready for takeoff. Theo Fernandez has been grounded. He's the only pilot that has never taken a vacation and the edict has been passed prove you're prioritizing a work-life balance or say goodbye to your wings. As he struggles to bask in his new downtime, without reconnecting with his family, he stumbles upon the perfect opportunity. The handsome guy who ""stole"" his mozzarella sticks at his favorite terminal eatery has a sudden opening for a partner . . . on a nationally televised reality show. Theo and Asher buckle up to fake date for the cameras, but as they do the undercurrents of attraction make them wonder if their on-screen chemistry hints at something bigger. Do they have the courage to leave behind their baggage, and wing it together for another chance at love? Download Link Here     Goodreads Link Here     Alex"

Now, he's the president of Jeff's Bagel Run, a Florida-based bagel shop chain with 15 locations. Wetherill told BI he's using the lessons he learned in tech to scale the bagel business. This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Justin Wetherill, cofounder of uBreakiFix and now president of Jeff's Bagel Run. The following has been edited for length and clarity. I never expected to end up in the bagel business. My career began with broken phones, not baked goods. In 2009, I shattered my own phone and tried to fix it — only to break it worse. That experience gave me a lightbulb moment: If someone like me, a self-proclaimed nerd, couldn't fix his own phone, there had to be a market for repair. I started buying broken phones and parts, learning to fix them, and selling the services on eBay and Craigslist. Soon, my friend David and I were meeting customers at Panera during lunch breaks to do on-the-spot repairs. That eventually led to our first uBreakiFix store opening in August 2009. The store outpaced our entire website's sales, and that success told us something: People didn't want to wait to mail out their devices. They needed fast, local solutions. Over the next three years, we grew to 47 corporate-owned locations. We franchised in 2012 and eventually scaled to about 550 stores by the time I stepped away in 2021. We were the authorized repair partner for Google and Samsung, had contracts with top carriers and insurers, and built proprietary tech to ensure consistency and efficiency across our stores. After stepping back, I took time to reset — spent more time with my family — and thought about what was next. That next step came unexpectedly. A guy in our office started bringing in bagels on Fridays, and we were all blown away by the quality. The bagels were from Jeff's Bagel Run, a small operation in Florida started by Jeff and Danielle Perera, who had grown from baking at home to selling at farmers markets and eventually opening a couple of shops. Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know I was intrigued — not just by the product, but by the potential. I met Jeff and Danielle, heard their story, and saw parallels between their journey and the early days of uBreakiFix. The bagels were exceptional, the business model simple, and the menu tight: just bagels, spreads, and coffee. That simplicity makes scaling easier and keeps the focus on quality. At the same time, I saw an opportunity to bring the operational and tech know-how I developed in the tech repair world into food. We started building from that foundation, working on ways to scale a small business with a bakery-first concept while keeping the heart of what made the original Jeff's Bagel Run special. Today, we have 15 stores, with six more opening in the next six weeks. It's going to be a busy summer. I don't see this as a short-term play. I want to be a ""bagel guy"" for the rest of my career. What I missed most after leaving uBreakiFix was being part of a great team, working together toward something big. I've reunited with many of the same people from that era, and we're being much more intentional about building something sustainable this time — something we can all be proud of for the long haul. This time around, we've gone even deeper into the tech. We built our own point-of-sale system, kitchen display system, and real-time integrations with delivery platforms like Uber Eats and DoorDash. Our system predicts sales patterns throughout the day and gives bakers real-time recommendations on what to make and when — all to maximize freshness and minimize waste. I joke all the time that we're the most sophisticated 15-store bagel chain the world's ever seen. It seems silly from the outside looking in, but we've got a full-stack development team and a full real estate team. We were built like a brand that's much bigger than ours, the technology that we have is really neat, and we're really excited to continue to leverage it and use this as the foundation to grow the business. Everything in our stores is made from scratch, within the four walls. The dough is mixed, rolled, proofed, boiled, topped, and baked fresh every day. That's not how most national chains operate anymore — they've shifted toward pre-made dough or frozen product and expanded into broader menus. But we've intentionally kept our focus narrow: we're a bakery first. We offer 15 bagel flavors every day, with one rotating ""bagel of the day"" that brings fun and variety, like blueberry cinnamon sugar or cheddar onion. We also added a full espresso and beverage program, and we've even acquired our original coffee roaster to vertically integrate and ensure quality control. Scaling this kind of model does come with challenges. We use tech to monitor and validate production processes and run secret shopper programs to ensure consistency at the store level. But ultimately, our philosophy is that technology should be a silent partner — it should enable our team to be more human, not less...."

I did find out there is a lot more factory / shift work here than in some other states and a lot of people do 4/10hr shifts instead of a 5day work week. So that accounts for quite a bit as well. On the same token though… being that tn is one of the 10 in poverty, no there are a lot of people not working too.

mov_DB5ED5F2AEC93350E3592F66167C5BE7,2025-07-18 16:33:35,en,WEB,"  As we move through 2025, the phrase “finding alpha” has become the mantra for private equity (PE) investors focused on the consumer sector. Confidence in the sector remains robust, but the narrative has shifted: it is no longer about broad-based acquisition strategies. Instead, the focus is on select, high-performing assets which outperform their market—particularly those founder-led or family-owned businesses that have achieved scale and are now ripe for PE investment. Selective Opportunities and Competitive Dynamics The current environment is not characterised by indiscriminate deal-making. Rather, PE firms are zeroing in on assets with proven growth, strong cash generation, and clear market differentiation. In these cases, deal processes are bifurcated: either hyper-competitive auctions for the most attractive assets, or bilateral negotiations with founders where long-standing relationships are pivotal. While bilateral negotiations may avoid the intensity of competitive auctions, they are no less complex. Successfully executing these deals demands meticulous preparation and a high degree of emotional intelligence to ensure that investors and founders are aligned—not just on terms, but on a shared vision for growth and the path to achieving it. Most of all, over the next six months, these relationships—carefully cultivated over years—will be put to the test, as founders seek partners who can help them reach the next stage of growth. Relationship-Driven Deals and Untapped Value The consumer sector, especially segments like beauty and personal care, is seeing a surge in interest from PE. These markets have historically been underpenetrated by institutional capital, leaving significant untapped value. Recent success stories, such as Medik8 and Summer Fridays, illustrate the potential for outsized returns when PE partners with high-growth, cash-generative businesses. These companies offer rich data points on performance and scalability, making them attractive targets for investment. Operational Value Creation: Beyond Financial Engineering In today's market, simply leveraging a business and hoping for multiple expansion is no longer sufficient. Sellers are becoming increasingly creative, especially when IPO exits are not viable. Options such as continuation funds, minority stake sales, and bringing in new partners for longer hold periods are all on the table. This environment demands a hyper-focus on operational value creation. PE firms are now expected to provide meaningful operational support—ranging from strengthening executive management teams and engaging operating partners, to investing in IT and digital infrastructure. The goal is to ensure that businesses scale efficiently and sustainably, maximising both growth and value creation. The Role of Technology and Digital Transformation Technological advancement, particularly in AI and digital marketing, is a critical lever for value creation. Firms that fail to capitalise on this window risk stagnating valuations. Conversely, those that invest in digital infrastructure and data-driven marketing strategies are well-positioned for a “hockey stick” trajectory in both business performance and exit valuations. This is especially true in consumer-facing businesses, where digital engagement and personalisation are key differentiators. Creative Exit Strategies and Investor Returns With traditional exits such as IPOs less certain, PE sellers are exploring alternative strategies to return value to investors. This includes holding assets longer, selling minority stakes, or structuring continuation vehicles. Each approach requires a thoughtful evaluation of the available levers to enhance multiples and deliver returns, reinforcing the need for deep operational engagement and strategic foresight. The next six months represent a critical window for private equity in the consumer sector. The firms that will succeed are those that combine strong relationships with founders, a disciplined focus on high-performing assets, and a willingness to roll up their sleeves and drive operational improvements. In a market where cash generation and digital transformation are paramount, “finding alpha” is less about financial engineering and more about building sustainable, scalable businesses. The hard work is just beginning, but the rewards for those who get it right could be substantial."
mov_D9D51A35587D40D914DE8167158C91BD,2025-07-18 16:55:04,en,WEB,"  WEST SPRINGFIELD, MA (WGGB/WSHM) -- In 2026, our country marks its 250th anniversary and, as we ramp up to the historic celebration, Western Mass News will be telling stories about our history over the next year. It's a series called “We The People” and will be an opportunity for us to look back on the achievements and events that make us who we are today. This story takes us back in time, quite a ways actually - several centuries - but as far as distance goes, it's not very far at all because it's in the heart of West Springfield. Welcome to Storrowton Village where, on the Eastern States Exposition fairgrounds, a small slice of colonial life sits amidst the hustle and bustle of our modern times. The scene is comprised of 10 historic buildings, including a barn, that date back to between 1767 and 1853. Though they're now arranged around a common, reminiscent of a small New England town, Samantha Depergola, assistant director of education at the Eastern States Exposition, said they weren't originally built here. “They come from different towns across Massachusetts and New Hampshire and they represent New England heritage,” she explained. The homage to our American heritage was all the brainchild of Helen Osborne Storrow, a prominent philanthropist from Boston. In the early days of the Eastern States Exposition, Storrow served as chair of the home department, a portion of the fair that featured exhibits about homemaking. However, always a visionary, she came up with the idea to house those exhibits in permanent structures and so the hunt for historical buildings began and so too did her dream: Storrowton Village. “She specifically sought buildings that were unique. That a piece of history would have been lost, to be abandoned or demolished because they weren't being utilized and she created, here, a vision of a New England village,” Depergola added. Between 1927 and 1930 and using $350,000 of her own money, or approximately $6 million dollars today, Storrow not only purchased these building, but she had them moved to West Springfield. It was something that, at the time, was revolutionary. “This village was actually the first-of-its-kind. So museums had been around for many years, but something like this wasn't really seen in America. Helen Storrow had all of these buildings moved here, so they're all original historic buildings and she was the first one to be able to take buildings completely deconstruct them, have each piece numbered, and brought in on flatbed trucks and then moved here to be used as a museum,” Depergola noted. The museum, visited by thousands every year, has become a treasure, not just to the Eastern States Exposition, Big E fairgoers, but also to the greater community beyond. For West Springfield Mayor Will Reichelt, it was the place where he went to summer camp as a counselor. “I'd have 10 kids with a junior counselor and we'd do crafts and make butter, milk goats, all kinds stuff...Yeah, the usual 17th Century experience on the fairgrounds for Storrowton,” he said. In fact, when he was in high school, the mayor would come back, dress up in period costumes, and provide hands-on history lessons to fairgoers. “During the fair, I would stay in the buildings. People come through and they would ask me questions and I'd talk to them about the different stuff, the different buildings, and explain where it came from. [Reporter: did you ever think at that time, 'Someday, I'm coming back as mayor'] No,” Reichelt added. Fast-forward to 2025: from a part-time Storrowton Village volunteer to now a full-time job running the city of westside. It's, perhaps, a fitting tribute to Storrow herself: a woman who saw the future by remembering and preserving our past. “It's nostalgia and it holds a large piece of history, our archives and all of our artifacts. Without that, a lot of this history would be lost and not only holding the…we were kind of the first museum that had been like this, as well as all of that history, is incredibly important to western Mass. and all of the people that it's helped through the classes that were held,” Depergola said. If you'd like to visit Storrowton Village Museum, their summer tours have begun. The guided walks are available Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays through August 2."

n3vgzer,2025-07-18 19:44:42,en,REDDIT,"  I do Monday-Thursday, cycle zero, show up by 6 AM, done by 5 PM at the absolute latest (usually closer to 4). Most drivers (and all new ones) have to work a weekend day but I've been there long enough with consistently good scores that they let me work when I want. It's a great set-up because I rarely have to deal with closed leasing offices or businesses, including the dreaded “we close at noon on Fridays in summer” situation. Plus it keeps my weekends free for my side gig at a bar (I do Friday/Saturday nights there. Have the daytime off on Friday to do my errands while most people work, and Sunday is my totally free day.) Overall it works well for me although I wish I got paid enough to just have one job."
mov_37CA423E065EF7186026A66FD530B7B2,2025-07-18 20:13:00,en,WEB,"  In late July, the average daily temperature in Arkansas is supposed to be in the mid-80s, according to the National Weather Service. Unfortunately, this is not an average summer. For at least the next week, the state is forecast to endure ""extreme"" heat, according to NWS meteorologist Justin Condry. A heat advisory for much of the state began Thursday at noon. ""We have the extreme heat warning across portions of central and northeastern Arkansas, and then heat advisories ... pretty much for most of the state, except for north central and northwestern Arkansas,"" Condry said. The criteria for a heat advisory is a heat index of 105 to 109 degrees. An extreme heat warning is any heat advisory above 110 degrees. Extreme heat warnings will likely be issued across northeastern Arkansas for much of next week, with at least heat advisories likely for much of the state. ""That even lingers into next week as we start seeing our actual temperatures reaching the lower 100, so like 100, 101, 102 with heat index values climbing back near that 110 mark,"" Condry said. The temperatures are ""well above average"" for this time of year. ""Unfortunately, it looks like it's going to hang around for quite a bit of time,"" Condry said. ""We're not really expecting much in the way of rainfall for at least a week."" Condry said the extreme temperatures should be expected through the end of the month. Cooling centers in Little Rock are located at the Dunbar Community Center, 1001 W. 16th St., Southwest Community Center, 6401 Baseline Road, and West Central Community Center, 8616 Colonel Glenn Road. The cooling center hours are open Monday through Friday 8 a.m. to 8:30 p.m., and Saturday 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The cooling center at Dunbar Community Center will also be open on Sundays from 1 p.m. to 6 p.m. this summer. North Little Rock opened a cooling center at the North Little Rock Community Center, 2700 Willow St., on Wednesday, and it will be open through the center's regular business hours through Sunday. The center is open 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. on Wednesdays and Thursdays, from 6 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Fridays, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturdays and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sundays. The city will re-evaluate what it will do on Monday. Jacksonville does not open any specific buildings to function as cooling centers because its community center and public library are open, Emily Sundermeier, a spokesperson for the city, told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette last month. The Jacksonville Community Center, located at 5 Municipal Drive, is open from 6 a.m. to 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Friday, 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and 12 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday. The Nixon Library, at 703 W. Main St., is open from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on Monday and Wednesday through Saturday, and from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m on Tuesday. The library is closed on Sunday. The city of Sherwood said residents can cool off at two locations. Residents can go to the Amy Sanders Library, located at 10200 Johnson Drive, which is open until 8 p.m. on Monday, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday and 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday. Residents 55 and older can go to the Sherwood Senior Citizens Center at 2301 Thornhill Drive. The center is open Monday through Thursday 9 a.m. to 4:45 p.m. and from 9 a.m. to 8:45 p.m. on Friday.

Lip care that also tastes like you're perpetually eating a s'more for less than $6?? My friends, life is good. Promising review: ""My new must-have! My number one go to for healing lips was Camex.

Bonus: This bb is an excellent way to prevent touching a germ-y tray, and it's fully machine washable. Check out a TikTok of the Airplane Pockets tray table cover in action. Airplane Pockets is a small business that specializes in sanitary, portable travel organization products. I used this on a roundtrip from NYC to Tokyo, both with connecting flights in Canada, and cannot sing its praises enough. It fit all four of the different tray tables I used it on and was so ridiculously handy for keeping track of all my littler odds and ends like AirPods, the plane's headphones, earplugs, a sleep mask, a book, gum, a scrunchie, and little snacks. The hanging end of it easily tucked into the built-in sleeve of the seat in front of me for takeoff and when other passengers needed to scoot past me in my aisle seat. Usually, I feel like a hot mess and get frustrated rooting around in the grimy sleeve for my stuff, and this was such a refreshing solution! Several flight attendants even asked where I got it to buy one for themselves! Get it from Amazon for $29.99. 3. A two-in-one nausea relief inhaler designed to work FAST on spontaneous nausea, motion sickness, morning sickness, and general queasiness (having a human body is hard).

Anytime that I started to feel woozy I'd reach for it. I'm sure the required act of deep breathing helped a lot - and breathing in the fragrance of the essential oil is very calming and effective. Worked for me! Wonderful!"" —Willy&Lilly Get a pack of two from Amazon for $12.99 (also available in a pack of four). 4.

This is a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lippie that's just a step above the ""no makeup makeup"" look, giving the perfect subtly polished effect. I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me.

It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference! Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me.

You need some teensy Lego ""happy plants,"" a weirdly adorable horror-themed coloring book, and a pound of cereal marshmallows to celebrate. 1. A mini Bob Ross paint-by-numbers kit for anyone on their ""happy accidents"" beat — this itty bitty set comes with everything you need to create three tiny masterpieces of your very own. The kit comes with three different numbered canvas designs, seven paint pots, a mini brush, and an easel. Promising review: ""I have to admit I was skeptical because of the price and size. However, I got these for my husband for his birthday (he loves Bob Ross) and what a find!! We had so much fun mixing colors and painting. Would definitely recommend. The fact that they are small makes them even more special. I wish there were more to paint!"" —slb m Get it from Amazon for $6.80. 2. A set of cheerful Lego botanical ""happy plants,"" aka your new favorite coworkers. How can capitalism bring you down when these two are smiling up at you all day long? All the joys of having an office plant without the shame of your coworkers being like, ""Shouldn't you ... maybe ... water that??"" Promising review: ""As an avid Lego enthusiast, I've had the pleasure of building numerous sets over the years, but this one stands out as a masterpiece. From the moment I opened the box, I was impressed by the thoughtfully organized bags and clear instructions, making the build both enjoyable and manageable. I love plants, so the attention to detail in this set had my heart!"" —Jami Get it from Amazon for $22.96. 3. McCormick's Potato Topping Seasoning for anyone who's not afraid to get a little feral about their air-fried, mashed, and baked potatoes — this blend of salt, garlic, and asiago cheese is so mouthwateringly delicious that you'll be dumping it on everything from popcorn to grilled cheese to guacamole. Promising review: ""I literally had to run to the store and get mashed potatoes so my son could have this again versus ice cream. It's so well done. I'm a sous chef and this is a go-to now for home cooking. Love it."" —Brandon Get it from Amazon for $4.98 (available in three variations). 4.

Check out a TikTok of Murdle in action. The best part?? Once you finish ""Murdling,"" you can use your sleuthing skills on Volume 2, Volume 3, and a whole BUNCH of other themed Murdle books! Promising review: ""The puzzles are a lot of fun but the characters, story lines, and other details take the Murdle experience to another level. I have no idea how the author came up with all of this creativeness! You can Murdle solo or with friends. I look forward to future volumes but this one will keep me busy for awhile!"" —Liz Gately Get it from Amazon for $8.71. 5. A limited edition (!!) Eos Marshmallow ""Super Balm"" lip treatment from the brand's ""secret menu"" so good that reviewers say it's better than Carmex for healing and better than Summer Fridays for quality.

A 2-in-1 nausea relief inhaler designed to work FAST on spontaneous nausea, motion sickness, morning sickness, and general queasiness (having a human body is hard). Summer road trips and cruises just got a HECK of a lot more bearable. You can either use it as a scent inhaler or rub it directly on the tip of your nose for relief. Promising review: ""Took this on my first cruise. Anytime when I started to feel woozy I'd reach for it. I'm sure the required act of deep breathing helped a lot - and breathing in the fragrance of the essential oil is very calming and effective. Worked for me! Wonderful!"" —Willy&Lilly Price: $12.99 for a pack of two (also available in a pack of four). 3. Eight Saints Firm Intentions Neck Cream, a super gentle but suuuuper effective formula that reviewers with sensitive skin swear by for helping firm the skin on their neck and chests without irritating it. This works gradually over time to help firm skin and reduce the appearance of lines, but many reviewers notice a difference on the first use! Eight Saints is a small business that specializes in skincare products. Promising review: ""I'm a huge fan of all things Eight Saints. I have sensitive skin, and this is the first skincare line that I have seen results in my skin texture and fine lines while not triggering my eczema. When I saw they added this neck cream to their product line, I knew I had to try it. At 39 years old, I've noticed some loss in firmness of my skin on my neck, and when I wake up in the morning, I have wrinkles on my decolletage from side sleeping. I started using this about a week ago, and I've already noticed improvements in the fine lines on my neck, plus when I wake up in the morning, no more wrinkles on my chest! It's so smooth, thick, and creamy, but rubs into your skin with ease, and it's so hydrating. Top quality product again from Eight Saints!"" —Ms Leach Price: $34 4. A reviewer-beloved Choco Musk concentrated perfume rollerball that's taking the affordable perfume world by storm — this is perfect for anyone who loooooves the smell of warm vanilla, spicy amber, and musky cocoa. Bonus: it's made without alcohol, so it doesn't have that chemical smell and will effortlessly blend with other scents! Promising review: ""I stocked up with a six-pack of this oil because it's literally heaven. Strong projection, long lasting, just a delicious blend of warm vanilla and sweet cocoa! I will never get tired of it. Choco Musk is already bomb by itself, but you can pair it with any gourmand scent and layer it for a deeper scent profile. I'm wrapped in a yummy scent bubble that leaves an alluring scent trail. "" —tima Price: $6.99 for two rollerballs (available in larger sets) 5. Billion Dollar Brows Eyebrow Powder that fills in your brows so naturally and realistically that you'll be like, ""Wait, are these mine??""

A tinted lip balm that's eerily close to the same magic as ""Black Honey,"" TikTok's beloved $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique, that it will genuinely startle you — especially when you see the price. This is a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lippie that's just a step above the ""no makeup makeup"" look, giving the perfect subtly polished effect. I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference! Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (also available in the pink honey version, and in a two-pack that mixes both!) . 2. Gold Bond's firming neck and chest cream your skin will be SO happy to soak up — this is formulated with aloe, salicylic acid, and jojoba oil to help hydrate, tighten, and gently exfoliate your skin so effectively that you should be able to see early results in two weeks. Reviewers especially love how affordable this is compared to creams that often cost three times this $12 price tag (or more)! Promising review: ""I am a lotion user every single day. I use face moisturizers that I love. I am over the moon by how good this is. I mainly use it on my neck, hands and forearms. The difference is amazing. My skin actually feels so good. I wish I could but larger containers of it."" —Kimberly P. Get it from Amazon for $11.97. 3. A TikTok-beloved ""Soft"" perfume rollerball that honestly has no right smelling so delectable and layering so well considering it's only five cash dollars. Reviewers are obsessed with the scent's warm sweetness with a hint of citrusy zest, comparing it to waffle cones, lemon pound cake, and warm vanilla scones ... and this $65 bottle of Pink Sugar  . Promising review: ""Like so many, I found this scent on TikTok. I was a bit skeptical at first but finally got around to trying it. First off, this scent smells amazing! Almost every time I've worn it, I receive compliments. It has a sweet smell, almost like warm cake or sugar cookies with a hint of lemon. With such an affordable price, I would definitely recommend this to anyone curious about trying it."" —Chrissy Get it from Amazon for $4.16. 4.

This vegan blend is easy for beginners to use without streaking or uneven patches, and although the tan is instant, the fade is nice and gradual. Promising review: “If you use St. Tropez tan products or any fake tanner, do yourself a favor and try this. This stuff is AWESOME. Dries quickly, lasts longer, does NOT make your skin stinky, applies evenly, and you get a fair amount of product!! Other tanners I've used become VERY noticeable when they start fading. Gross hand lines, patchy white spots, etc., but not this stuff. The best one-hour tan I have ever used!” —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $9.97 (available in 16 styles)...."

mov_79914D50B0A17001D474FA65DE2DC26D,2025-07-20 09:00:45,en,WEB,"  When night falls and the Great Bath empties of visitors, it usually morphs into a quiet place of glimmering light and shadows. But not at weekends this summer. DJs and musicians are to set up next to the steaming water and turn the historic space in the city of Bath into something of a party venue. “It's a departure for us, an experiment,” said Amanda Hart, the director of archaeology at . “We would like people to experience the baths in a different way and maybe attract a slightly different audience – visitors who wouldn't necessarily come to the baths.” The Summer Lates music series promises DJs playing disco, funk, gospel and jazz as well as live acoustic sets. It is not clear if people will dance. “We're all a bit unsure as to how people are going to respond,” said Hart. “Maybe people will have a bit of a dance.” But what would the Romans have made of it? Hart said there was no firm evidence music had been played at the baths in the south-west of England in Roman times 2,000 years ago – but she believes it probably was. Music was important in ancient Rome and was played on social occasions and at ceremonies and spectacles. “I think we can make the assumption that music was played at the baths,” Hart said. “It was a very sociable place. People wanted to be seen there and hang out and some people did business there and ate there. “It wasn't just a place to go and partake in the bathing routine. It was a place to meet people and have fun as well. We're picking up on that idea. These were not quiet, contemplative places to be.” The Roman philosopher Seneca the Younger wrote vividly about how rowdy baths could be. directly above a public baths and described the noise in a letter: the arguments, the hullabaloo of a thief being caught, the cacophony of a bather who wrongly thought he was a good singer, the splash of a person leaping into the water. “Think of the different shouts of the drinks seller and the sausage seller and the pastry seller and all the cookshop hawkers selling their wares, each with his own personal cry,” he wrote. The idea of the Summer Lates sessions is not to generate raucous evenings but to create a “subtle, ambient” atmosphere. The publicity material promises the baths will be turned into a “rich soundscape where heritage meets rhythm”. There will be live performances by Hayden Thorpe, the former frontman , and Our Man in the Field, an Americana group. The Bristol-based DJs Beavs (Lauren Beavis) and Fivestylez (Oli Ackroyd) are among those who will play sets. The Bath and North East Somerset council leader, Kevin Guy, said the Roman baths had long been a place where people came together. “We're continuing that tradition in a bold and contemporary way. It reflects our ongoing commitment to sharing Bath's heritage in ways that are creative and relevant, and we look forward to welcoming residents and visitors to experience the Roman baths in this new way.” Summer Lates is a six-week programme of evening openings from 21 July to 31 August. The Great Bath will be lit with torches and there will be a pop-up bar. The live music and DJ sets will take place on Friday, Saturday and Sunday evenings. From Monday to Thursday, the Roman baths will remain open until 8pm. On Fridays, Saturdays, Sundays and the August bank holiday Monday, the site will host visitors until 10pm."

""We're learning to waltz on ice."" Davis was mid-rehearsal for ""The Gig: After Moise and the World of Reason,"" which runs through Aug. 2 at the Peter W. Foote Vietnam Veterans Skating Rink in North Adams. The site-specific offering is part of Williamstown Theatre Festival's splashy season - and a look at how such events can attract new audiences. If you go ""The Gig: After Moise and the World of Reason"" Where: Williamstown Theatre Festival at the Peter W. Foote Vietnam Veterans Skating Rink, 1267 South Church St., North Adams When: 7:30 p.m. Fridays and 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. Saturdays, July 25 through Aug. 2 Tickets: $50 Notes: Patrons should dress warmly - audience seating is on the ice. More info: 413-458-3253 or wtfestival.org While Jeremy O. Harris, playwright and Williamstown Theatre Festival's creative director, pitched the idea of adapting Tennessee Williams' novel ""Moise and the World of Reason"" for the ice, Davis was excited by the challenge. He hadn't heard of the novel, which isn't surprising - Williams' plays became his legacy, and this explicitly queer novel was not well received by critics when it debuted in 1975, pushing it into obscurity. Also, Davis had never skated. But while setting ""The Gig"" on ice ""certainly wasn't"" the only way to adapt ""Moises and the World of Reason,"" Davis said, it felt right (and he learned how to skate over the first two weeks of rehearsal). ""What made this a powerful way to adapt this book is there are themes about failure and loss and trying to navigate a world that isn't quite loving you back,"" Davis said. ""There's something about performing that on a slippery surface that feels like it's holding the metaphor in exactly the way one would want."" ""The Gig"" is less of an adaptation and more of a ""reaction"" to Williams' novel, Davis said. The 1975 story is a ""hedonistic romp through New York"" centered around a West Village trio: Moise, a young painter who decides she is leaving ""the world of reason"" and abandoning art; the narrator, an unnamed gay writer from Alabama; and the late Lance, a figure skater and the writer's former lover. Its depiction of queer life in a ""pre-AIDS-epidemic moment in New York"" was ""very much ahead of its time,"" Davis said. ""It's very boldly gay,"" Davis said. ""There's a brashness and a boldness and a jubilance to the manner in which this book is gay, and the characters in it are gay."" ""The Gig"" is ""a narrative dance piece,"" Davis said, complete with two disco numbers. To bring the movement to life, he collaborated with assistant choreographer Douglas Webster, founding artistic director of Ice Dance International and a globally renowned figure-skating choreographer. To Davis, the restrictions of the icy setting ""are a gift."" Instead of limiting creativity, it fuels it. ""I find 'no' to be a very creative space,"" Davis said. ""An ice rink has this beautiful set of ingredients. It's slippery and it's cold, it's a white surface, it's an oval. And you can just write these things down as these are the ingredients I have to work with."" And the site-specific nature of ""The Gig"" has made this one of Williamstown Theatre Festival's most anticipated offerings, even though audiences will need to bundle up in the middle of July to see it (the rink is kept at 45 degrees). Davis thinks it's because ""The Gig"" is creating a singular event that can't be experienced elsewhere. It's one way to keep theater audiences returning and expanding. ""If the theater is offering an event, there's something about it that I can't get somewhere else,"" said Davis, who is the artistic director at Rattlesnake Theater in the West Village. ""it's not these conversations we have about human connection and intimacy and being in a group. Those are all wonderful things and important things, and they are the provenance of the theater for sure. But an event, a theatrical event - we want just a little bit of magic."" Theatermakers are embracing this magic-making mission using site-specifc elements. The swarm of ""Sunset Boulevard"" actors and film crew parading through rain, snow and sun in the West End, then Broadway, energized director Jamie Lloyd's revival for a new, online generation of theatergoers. Before folding earlier this year, On Site Opera transformed the Bronx Zoo, the Atlanta Botanical Gardens and a historic cargo ship into operatic landscapes. Locally, Opera Saratoga transformed a new work, ""In A Grove,"" into an intimate adventure through Saratoga Spa Park earlier this summer. Mary Birnbaum, artistic director of Opera Saratoga, first directed ""In A Grove"" when it debuted in 2022 in Pittsburgh, then again early this year at the Prototype Festival at LaMaMa in New York City. Those critically acclaimed productions were presented in more traditional theater settings. When Opera Saratoga began discussing how to bring opera to Saratoga Spa State Park, which houses the nonprofit's offices, ""In A Grove"" was an ""organic"" fit, Birnbaum said. The story - a murder mystery based on a Japanese short story by Ryūnosuke Akutagawa - is set in the woods. Birnbaum directed it to take place at several stations throughout the park, with the audience following the action. ""What's more immersive than going into the woods, being bitten by bugs, solving a mystery that takes place in the woods?"" Birnbaum said. Directing ""In A Grove"" as a site-specific work was like ""returning home"" for Birnbaum, who started her career working heavily in the space. Through the experimental group Art Party Theater Company, she co-created the buzzy ""Starbox"" at Bryant Park in 2010...."

mov_6B25779353235FAF5BB86A3614ACCB07,2025-07-20 20:44:00,en,WEB,"  ""Amazon stretched out its annual Prime Day sales event so that it lasted four days — twice as long as in the past — and, as a result, blew away previous sales figures,"" reports USA Today: Spending for [the four-day] Prime Day amounted to ""more than two Black Fridays — which drove $10.8 billion in online spending during the 2024 holiday shopping season — and sets a new benchmark for the summer shopping season,"" Adobe said in a news release. The total also surpassed Adobe's pre-Prime Day estimate of $23.8 billion in sales. But an article in Fortune notes that ""what stood out to this longtime Amazon watcher is that the company didn't disclose anything about the number of items sold."" The last time it made that choice was 2020, when nothing normal was happening anywhere in the world, and Prime Day was moved from summer to October. Before that, you have to go back to the second-ever Prime Day in 2016 to find a wrap-up that didn't provide any update on the number of ""units"" sold. It's unclear exactly why Amazon decided to withhold that number for 2025, but this Prime Day was odd for a few reasons. Sellers, and brands big and small, had to come up with different strategies to contend with tariff chaos. And they're trying to woo increasingly pessimistic consumers. Those factors could be weighing on the company's decision to withhold exact numbers. Instead Amazon's official Prime Day recap swapped in some unusual alternate statistics. For example, Amazon reported that if you added up all the discounts given to customers over the four-day event, it was larger than any previous total amount of all discounts given to customers (over the earlier two-day events). To be sure, it's possible that this Prime Day was a success. An outside analysis from Adobe estimated that sales across online retailers overall increased by more than 30% during this year's four day Prime Day period, compared to last year. And Amazon said in this year's recap that the four days of Prime Day 2025 outsold any other four-day period that included previous Prime Days. But historically, the event hasn't run longer than two days. That means that previous years have included two prime days and two regular days, while this year included four prime days. It's unclear why the company would change the basis of comparison. Amazon ""declined to comment on the absence of specific product sales tallies for 2025,"" according to the article (while pointing Fortune instead to an Amazon blog post with facts about past Prime Day events.) But in a sign of the time, Amazon's announcement notes that their Prime Day customers found deals and other product information using Amazon's AI-generated buying guides, as well as an AI-powered shopping assistant named Rufus and Alexa+ — Amazon's next-generation personal assistant (""now available in Early Access to millions of customers""). Another interesting statistic? USA Today notes that ""a majority of shoppers (53.2%) made purchases on mobile devices, compared to on desktop computers, accounting for $12.8 billion of the spending, according to Adobe."""

Might be the only explanation for how this can matte-ify your complexion while still keeping it radiant and glowy like the fresh summer dew. ✨ Promising review: ""I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe."" —Charlotte Laim Price: $25 2. A pair of Bottega Veneta–inspired pilot shield sunglasses so close to the $699 version that reviewers are *spooked* by the attention to detail, down to the weight of them. These are already blowing up on TikTok so I'd personally grab them NOW before everyone descends on them. Promising review: ""TikTok made me buy these!! One video did it for me and I RAN to Amazon. And yes, I bought ALLL the colors. They fit like a dream and are good quality. People that know their sunglasses thought these were the REAL THING! For the price, these are made EXTREMELY well and look hecka expensive. Get all the colors so you can wear them for every season."" —Santana Davis Price: $14.99 (available in 10 tints) 3. E.l.f. Glow Reviver Melting Lip Balm for all the ultra fans of Summer Fridays, Rhode, and Laneige whose bank accounts are begging them to put a stop to the lippie madness. These new deliciously tinted, moisturizing, buildable glosses are just as buttery and decadent as the balms that inspired them, for a fraction of the price. (Brb, drowning myself in the ""Strawberry Shortcake"" and ""Vanilla Toffee"" flavors.) Promising review: ""Diva, stop letting these influencers sway you into spending your hard-earned (and scarce) beans on $20–$30 subpar lip balms — you're paying for the brand, and the quality is questionable. ELF KNOCKED THEM BOTH OUTTA THE PARK WITH THIS! SO BUTTERY, SO YUMMY, SOOOOOOO MUCH PRODUCT!!!!! i wasn't expecting the tube to be so generous in size, by far the biggest amount I've seen from the market. The flavors are divine, the color payoff is even better than Summer Fridays … and it's only $9, you cannot go wrong. I just can't fathom any balm being priced above $12, E.l.f. always hits and barely misses. "" —SONIA Price: $9 (available in Strawberry Shortcake, Blackberry Sorbet, Java Chip, Vanilla Toffee, Wild Cherry, and Yummy Gummy). 4. Dae's Hair Cactus Fruit 3-In-1 Styling Cream & Taming Wand, which is basically the brand's ""holy grail,"" TikTok-famous styling cream in the form of a mascara wand. This versatile lil' tool helps you carefully target flyaways, style edges, and smooth frizz. Dae is a small business that specializes in haircare and styling products. Check out a TikTok of the taming wand in action. (It goes without saying that you don't need to lay your edges if you don't want to, but this is a handy option if you do.) Promising review: ""I've tried numerous products for taming baby hairs, especially post-partum, and this is hands down the best thing I've tried. It also smells incredible! Love the size of the styling wand!"" —Completely happy customer! Price: $17 5. Sol de Janeiro's Jet Set for anyone who wants to try all the most iconic products that come in the brand's cult-favorite ""sunshine"" scents without paying a pretty penny for all three — now you can snag a Bum Bum Cream, body and hair mist, *and* body wash in one convenient set, and even take them traveling with you. Psst — you can get this in the original Cheirosa 62 scents, *plus* three others! Promising review: ""Lately, I've been wanting to find a signature fragrance versus just smelling clean. I tried several perfumes, including high-end, and they just didn't seem to be a good fit with my body chemistry, or the smells just seemed to disappear...."
