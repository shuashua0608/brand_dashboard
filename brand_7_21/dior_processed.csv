1E5CC5E6F41CB49B75088E3749C263A1,2025-07-14 07:39:14,en,PRINT,"  Since returning to public life after cancer treatment last year, Catherine, Princess of Wales, has thrown herself back into her royal duties - showcasing an array of stellar outfits in the process. Her summer style has been a masterclass in on-trend elegance, and she's relied on the dresses, hats, shoes and jewellery already in her wardrobe. Yet the 43-year-old's look has subtly changed in other ways. ""Since becoming Princess of Wales, she's gone from wearing print and lace detail to colour-blocking,"" says fashion writer Simon Glazin, whose TikTok account @theverysimong is followed by 40,300 royal style watchers. ""The Queen was almost always seen in one colour, and looking at the queens of Europe, they all like to wear one colour at a time. For Kate, it signifies that she is very much stepping into her queen era."" But her picks aren't just for royals. Here's our guide to channelling Kate's style on the high street - and nabbing some bargains in the sales too. THE LOOK: AQUAMARINE TAILORED DRESS COAT WHERE: TROOPING THE COLOUR, JUNE 14 The Princess looked regal in a bright aquamarine woollen dress coat with ivory lapels and cuffs by Catherine Walker - a favourite of Princess Diana's - with a wide-brimmed Juliette Botterill hat. A popular colour this season, an aquamarine midi or maxi dress is perfect for weddings, holiday nights out or just floating around in the sun. Go formal as Kate's done, or make it summer-worthy with a short-sleeved or sleeveless option. THE LOOK: WHITE BLAZER DRESS WHERE: VE DAY CONCERT, MAY 8, AND ORDER OF THE GARTER CEREMONY, JUNE 16 For the concert commemorating VE Day, Kate put her best fashion foot forward in a glamorous recycled Self-Portrait cream tailored boucle and chiffon midi blazer dress, £460. Less than a month later, she wore it again at the Order of the Garter Ceremony at Windsor Castle, teaming it with a multistrand string of pearls and a cream Strathberry Multrees chain wallet, £295. ""I like that the skirt has the lace element at the bottom and she's almost tapping into the necklace layering trend with the five-strand pearl necklace,"" Ivory leather clutch, £"" says Simon. £85, www.phase-eight.com Cream boucle THE LOOK: WHITE AND BLACK POLKA DOT DRESS WHERE: VE DAY SERVICE, MAY 8 As part of the VE Day celebrations, Kate looked sophisticated in a recycled white polka-dot Alessandra Rich dress with a fascinator by Juliette Botterill. ""Polka dots are very on trend at the moment,"" says Simon. ""This reminds me of Joan Collins-era 80s with the voluminous sleeves above the wrist. If you want to make the trend more fun, wear a red lip or bright handbag."" Ariella midi dress, £249, holland www.cooper.com Caprilite pillbox headband fascinator, £16.99, www.amazon.co.uk COMPILED BY LUISA METCALFE THE LOOK: STRIPED BLAZER AND CHINOS WHERE: RHS WELLBEING GARDEN AT COLCHESTER HOSPITAL, JULY 2 Kate was radiant in her smart-casual mix of beige pinstripe £1,000 Blazé Milano blazer, Ralph Lauren shirt, £740, brown trousers, and white Veja Esplar leather trainers, £78. ""It's great to see her being more casual. She's paired two stripes together, which is almost her way of doing print-clash and I love the subtle turn-up of her cuffs,"" says Simon. THE LOOK: BLUSH SKIRT SUIT WHERE: GREETING PRESIDENT MACRON AT RAF NORTHOLT ON JULY 8 Kate pulled a style blinder with the blush-toned 30 Montaigne Rose Des Vents bar jacket, a reinterpretation of the iconic 1947 original by Christian Dior by Maria Grazia Chiuri. Topped with a Rita hat by Jess Collett, Princess Diana's earrings, a pearl necklace from the late Queen's collections and long wavy hair, Kate's look was incredibly chic, cleverly making reference to French design. THE LOOK: GREEN TROUSER SUIT WHERE: THE QUEEN ELIZABETH II AWARD FOR BRITISH DESIGN, MAY 13 Kate proved she can look as stylish in a suit as in a dress when she donned a £1,340 green Victoria Beckham trouser suit and a £565 Knatchbull silk blouse. ""She does tailoring well - the cut of the trousers made her look so tall,"" says Simon. ""This is a transitional colour, you can wear this as we move from summer to autumn.""

mov_026F050EA4E62877960F966F4F3F43F7,2025-07-14 08:56:53,en,WEB,"  MILAN (Reuters) - An Italian court on Monday placed under judicial administration LVMH's high-end Italian cashmere firm Loro Piana for indirectly subcontracting its production to Chinese-owned firms accused of exploiting workers, the latest brand to be embroiled in investigations into labour malpractice inside the Italian luxury supply chain. The court in Milan ordered a one-year administration for Loro Piana Spa, according to a 26-page ruling reviewed by Reuters, in the latest in a string of cases that have tainted the image of Italy's luxury brands. The administration will be lifted earlier if the company brings its practices into line with legal requirements. The court said Loro Piana Spa ""culpably failed"" to adequately oversee its suppliers in order to pursue higher profits. Loro Piana could not immediately be reached for comment. LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, acquired 80 percent of Loro Piana in July 2013, leaving 20 percent in the hands of the Italian family that founded the company. Loro Piana is the fifth fashion company to be targeted by the same Milan court over similar labour issues since December 2023, following Italian fashion group Valentino, an Italian unit of LVMH's Dior, Italy's Armani, and Alviero Martini, an Italian handbag company. The Milan court lifted the judicial administration it placed on Dior, Armani and Alviero Martini before the end of the one-year deadline imposed on them. The order again Valentino, on the other hand, is much more recent, dating back to May. (Reporting by Emilio ParodiEditing by Keith Weir)"

UgwSSMrJcOnc2DGQTB14AaABAg,2025-07-14 10:07:12,en,YOUTUBE,  I mean the highheels is a wrong fact. Historically it is like this: King Louis XIV was known for being short. As a king the shorter you are the less powerful you are in the eyes of others. In order to get respect he asked the royal Shoemaker to create a shoe that makes him taller in order to get the respect he deserves. Now that is one Story. Fact tho is that the High Heel itself doesn't have just one inventor but is smth that has developed throughout hundreds of years. It was used for Horsemen so that they have better grip when in the saddle and that comes from Persian Horsemens Riding boots. Then it was used by Royals and soon enough when Roger Vivier made the Stiletto-heel in 1950's for Dior it finally became a product that's very famous and worn everyday by millions of women around the globe.
mov_AB5B1BEF3EFE9051003E7A300A637EAE,2025-07-14 10:08:30,zh-tw,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[zh-tw]黑衣人群在深夜時分對民宅附近的車輛進行暴力砸毀，事件起因竟是兩大幫派間的債務糾紛。 花蓮太陽會與明仁會因地下賭盤一萬多元賭資爭議，先後發生打人及砸車報復事件。 警方迅速行動，逮捕明仁會、太陽會等相關涉案成員，並查獲毒品、改造手槍及仿冒刑警背心等違禁品。 此次幫派暴力事件嚇壞當地居民，明仁會梁姓主嫌已被羈押禁見。 6/16晚間11點55分，多名男子在黑暗中來到一處民宅前，手持球棒肆無忌憚地對停放在路邊的車輛進行猛烈攻擊。 他們不顧可能會吵醒附近居民，瘋狂敲打車輛，導致車窗玻璃碎滿地，車身多處凹陷破損。 完成洩憤後，這群人迅速逃回自己的車上離開現場，甚至造成路過民眾的車輛被卡住。 這起暴力砸車事件背後，實際上是幫派間的仇恨延續。 事發前兩個小時，警方曾在同一地區攔查約20多名黑衣人，這些人全都是太陽會幫派成員，其中幾人就是後來砸車的嫌犯。 當時晚間9點多，這群人已經在策劃如何暴力洩憤，但被警方即時驅離。 警方展開蒐證後發現，整起事件源於花蓮太陽會林姓男子經營地下賭盤，與明仁會梁姓角頭之間的糾紛。 梁姓角頭不歸還一萬多元賭資，不滿林姓男子不斷追債，於是率眾打人。 太陽會的邱姓大哥得知此事後，立即找人想討回面子，才有了後來的砸車報復行動。 檢方指揮搜索11處據點，逮捕明仁會花蓮分會及太陽會多名幫眾。 花蓮刑大大隊長劉宗仁表示，現場發現的偽造刑警背心，疑似是竹聯幫明仁會想要用來對對方進行恐嚇，懷疑是為了恐嚇取財，所幸警方即時攔阻。 《TVBS》提醒您：

mov_3BB0F8F0D6D30338343D2D43FF4C446C,2025-07-14 13:43:00,en,WEB,"  Fashion has long held a special place in its sartorial heart for the world of dance and performance. Just think of the never-ending tyranny of the ballet flat – still twirling its way down runways from Ferragamo to JW Anderson and, of course, Simone Rocha. The style has long been the cornerstone of the 2010s It-girl wardrobe, as shown by the likes of Alexa Chung and Kate Moss. After a brief fall from grace (the dark days of Fila Disruptors and other such ankle-breaking styles), the ballet flat has pirouetted back into our good graces with a vengeance: ballet sneakers, ballet loafers, ballet heels, we're all gunning for our moment. Quietly leading the (not so quiet) ballet flat revival? French It-girl brand Repetto, now co-opted by Lily-Rose Depp and the coquette-core girlies alike. But long before ballet flats were associated with any kind of - Repetto had a more unlikely mascot: Serge Gainsbourg. In the 1970s, the surly Frenchman swore by Repetto's Zizi style, a soft jazz shoe named after dancer Zizi Jeanmaire, daughter-in-law of brand founder Rose Repetto. Now, Derbies – specifically the slim, supple kind – are ready for a comeback. Jacquemus led the charge with a spring/summer 2024 collaboration with Repetto, while Lemaire has quietly adopted the lace-up style du jour. Most recently, they've popped up at Celine, where Michael Rider's French take on American prep is quickly emerging as a new trend (see also: Jonathan Anderson's Dior). More practical than ballet flats (which often have the structural integrity of a piece of paper) and with more flare than a loafer, the Derby style is made for actual walking. Whether you channel Gainsbourg's brooding summer mood or take the Audrey Hepburn approach, the all-singing, all-dancing shoe is ready for its return to the stage. A.P.C.

mov_BAABFC754377580B79B5BCA2D755EF30,2025-07-14 13:45:52,en,WEB,"  Rihanna put an elegant twist on lingerie styling and added exaggerated proportions to her Saint Laurent look for the premiere of the animated film “Smurfs” in Los Angeles on Sunday. The Savage x Fenty founder attended the premiere alongside her sons, three-year-old RZA Athelston Mayers and two-year-old Riot Rose Mayers, both of whom wore Dior Men suits. Rihanna was wearing a look from Saint Laurent's fall 2025 ready-to-wear collection, which debuted during Paris Fashion Week last March. The Grammy Award-winning artist's attire featured a black dress with lacy, lingerie-inspired detailing at the bust. The lace detailing transitioned into a silky smooth fabric. The look featured a drop-waist element to accentuate the singer's baby bump, which she debuted at the 2025 Met Gala last May. The drop waist was further defined with a deep olive green sash and a voluminous skirt. Rihanna paired the dress with a retro leather bomber jacket. Her hair was styled into an updo, complemented by soft makeup, including a pink lip, to complete her look. Rihanna's look was designed by Saint Laurent's creative director Anthony Vaccarello. “The fall collection packed a wallop with its rich palette; sophisticated color combinations immediately recognizable as YSL, like ochre-khaki or orange-purple; commanding shoulders, and a low-slung waistline which tied a neat bow on the '80s trend that's been percolating through Paris,” Miles Socha wrote in WWD's review of the collection. Rihanna's sons, both of whom she shares with partner A$AP Rocky, were styled in pieces by Dior Men. Rihanna's look was curated by stylist Jahleel Weaver. “Smurfs,” directed by Chris Miller and based on the popular 1960s cartoon, follows Smurfette, voiced by Rihanna, as she leads the Smurfs in rescuing Papa Smurf from the evil wizards Razamel and Gargamel.

Loro Piana Spa will undergo court monitoring for a year, according to the 26-page ruling reviewed by Reuters, which stems from investigations into the world of subcontracting for luxury goods in Italy that started in 2023. Units of fashion brands Valentino, LVMH's second largest brand Dior, Italy's Armani, and Italian handbag company Alviero Martini were also placed under administration. The Court of Milan found that Loro Piana, which makes expensive cashmere clothing, subcontracted its production through two front firms that had no actual manufacturing capacity to Chinese-owned workshops in Italy, which the court said exploited workers. LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, acquired 80% of Loro Piana in July 2013, with the Italian family that founded the company retaining 20%, according to the court ruling. In June, Loro Piana appointed Frederic Arnault, a son of LVMH chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault, as its CEO. The Milan court, as in the cases of the other brands targeted by the investigation, found Loro Piana ""culpably failed"" to adequately oversee its suppliers in order to pursue higher profits, according to the ruling. Loro Piana declined to comment. LVMH was not immediately available for comment. The owners of the contracting and subcontracting companies were under investigation by Milan prosecutors for exploiting workers and employing people off the books. Loro Piana Spa itself faces no criminal probe. The prosecutors in the case said the violation of rules among fashion companies in Italy was ""a generalised and consolidated manufacturing method"". ""Direct experience [from all the various investigations, i.e. Armani, Dior, Valentino, Alviero Martini and Loro Piana on the control of production chains] indicates that the complete outsourcing of industrial production processes is aimed exclusively at reducing labour costs and, consequently, also the criminal and administrative liability of the company with regard to worker safety... All this is done with a view to maximising profits at the lowest possible production cost,"" the Court of Milan said in its ruling on Monday. WORKER ABUSES AT SUBCONTRACTORS Italy is home to thousands of small manufacturers that make up 50%-55% of global luxury goods production, consultancy Bain has calculated. In May, Italy's fashion brands signed an accord with legal and political authorities to fight worker exploitation, but the ruling on Loro Piana said ""this production chain, headed by Loro Piana, has continued to operate until now"" and despite the previous cases being widely reported. The case involving Loro Piana Spa originated after Carabinieri police from the Milan labour protection unit in May arrested a Chinese workshop owner and closed his factory in the northwestern suburbs of Milan. The employer was reported by one of his workers for beating him, causing injuries that required 45 days of treatment, after the worker demanded 10,000 euros ($11,692.00) in unpaid wages. Carabinieri police found that the workshop produced Loro Piana-branded cashmere jackets and that its 10 Chinese labourers, including five illegal immigrants, were forced to work up to 90 hours a week, seven days a week, were paid 4 euros an hour, and slept in rooms illegally set up inside the factory. Carabinieri said in a statement they inspected two intermediary companies and three Chinese workshops, all in the Milan area, and identified 21 workers, 10 of whom were working off the books without proper registration, including seven illegal immigrants. According to the court ruling, the owner of an intermediary company stated that in recent years she had been producing around 6,000-7,000 jackets per year for Loro Piana at an agreed price of 118 euros per jacket if the order was for more than 100 items and 128 euros if the order was under 100 items. Based on the Loro Piana website, for example, men's cashmere jackets range from a minimum of over 3,000 euros to a maximum of over 5,000 euros. In their statement, Carabinieri concluded they had closed two Chinese-owned factories, the third being a `paper´ company with no production capacity, and imposed a joint fine of over 240,000 euros. The Milan court in its ruling on Loro Piana also appointed an external administrator to verify the company meets all the judges' demands on control of its supply chain. The administration will be lifted earlier if the unit brings its practices into line with legal requirements, as was the case with Dior, Armani and Alviero Martini.

E' solo l'ultimo atto di una campagna che si basa su una concezione creativa della giustizia Sullo stesso argomento: Il metodo Storari colpisce ancora e la procura di Milano, con la sua giustizia creativa, conferma ormai la sua trasformazione nella più grande agenzia del lavoro e tributaria. Ieri il tribunale di Milano ha disposto l'amministrazione giudiziaria per un anno nei confronti della società Loro Piana, noto brand della moda di lusso attualmente controllato dal gruppo francese Lvmh, con amministratore delegato Frédéric Arnault. A chiedere e a ottenere il provvedimento dei giudici della sezione misure di prevenzione è stato il pm milanese Paolo Storari nell'ambito dell'ennesima indagine per caporalato. Dall'inchiesta sarebbe emerso infatti che la produzione dei capi di abbigliamento – affidata da Loro Piana a ditte esterne – sarebbe avvenuta in contesti lavorativi di “sfruttamento del lavoro”. Attenzione: secondo la procura guidata da Marcello Viola, Loro Piana non ha consapevolmente sfruttato i lavoratori, ma “non avrebbe messo in atto misure idonee alla verifica delle reali condizioni lavorative nelle aziende appaltatrici”, col risultato di agevolare colposamente i soggetti responsabili di caporalato. Loro Piana è solo l'ultimo gigante della moda a finire nel mirino di Storari, dopo Armani, Dior, Alviero Martini e Valentino Bags Lab (società controllata da Valentino anch'essa posta a maggio in amministrazione giudiziaria). La crociata di Storari non riguarda solo le aziende della moda, ma si estende anche alle imprese attive nei settori della logistica, della grande distribuzione e della vigilanza privata, come Dhl, Esselunga, Carrefour, Gls, Brt, Uber, SicurItalia, Lidl, Gxo, Amazon, Fed Ex. Il metodo Storari è sempre lo stesso: imputare direttamente alle imprese che stipulano i contratti di appalto gli eventuali reati commessi dalle società alle quali si sono affidate. Una vera creazione giurisprudenziale della procura di Milano (avallata dal tribunale, ma che non ha avuto repliche in altre parti del nostro paese): alle imprese viene addossato un obbligo di controllo nei confronti delle società fornitrici che la legge non prevede e che invece dovrebbe essere svolto dallo stato. Questo teorema ardito viene portato avanti dal pm Storari attraverso la massiccia richiesta di applicazione di sequestri preventivi nei confronti delle aziende, se non addirittura dell'amministrazione giudiziaria. Il caso Loro Piana, data la notorietà del brand, ha avuto grande risalto mediatico, ma basti considerare che soltanto la scorsa settimana un altro gruppo leader nel settore dei trasporti delle spedizioni, Rhenus Logistics, è stato oggetto di un decreto di sequestro preventivo d'urgenza, emesso dalla procura di Milano, di oltre 43 milioni di euro, sempre sulla base di accuse di caporalato. Nelle 200 pagine del provvedimento il pm Storari sottolinea come, a seguito di indagini simili sui “serbatoi di manodopera”, i sequestri hanno consentito di recuperare oltre 612 milioni di euro e che dopo queste inchieste sono stati assunti e stabilizzati “circa 49 mila lavoratori”. Insomma, è lo stesso magistrato ad ammettere di stare portando avanti una campagna giudiziaria, anziché limitarsi a evidenziare le irregolarità riscontrate nel caso specifico. Per la procura di Milano c'è un sistema da abbattere, come ai tempi di Tangentopoli. E anche oggi la crociata viene condotta con metodi a dir poco discutibili.

A Milan Court has put Loro Piana into a judicial administration procedure concerning alleged worker exploitation in the Italian luxury brand's supply chain. Loro Piana in a statement on Monday evening said it “acknowledges the notification received from the Court of Milan's Preventive Measure Section today regarding labor practices by undisclosed and unauthorized subcontractors of one of its suppliers.” The Italian luxury company stated that “in breach of its legal and contractual obligations, the supplier did not inform Loro Piana of the existence of these subcontractors. Loro Piana was made aware of this situation on May 20, and, as a result, the maison terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours.” Furthermore, “Loro Piana firmly condemns any illegal practices and reaffirms its unwavering commitment to upholding human rights and compliance with all applicable regulations throughout its supply chain. Loro Piana is committed to ensuring that all its suppliers comply with the maison's highest quality and ethical standards in line with its Code of Conduct. In this perspective, Loro Piana has been constantly reviewing and will continue to strengthen its control and audit activities.” According to media reports, Loro Piana sells cashmere jackets with a price tag of 3,000 euros, which, through its subcontractors, would allegedly actually cost only 100 euros. The firm denied this claim. “The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier, nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.” Looking ahead, Loro Piana concluded by stating that it “expresses its full willingness to cooperate with the relevant authorities on this matter and intends to provide the utmost support for any further investigations.” Loro Piana is controlled by the LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and is helmed by chief executive officer Frédéric Arnault, who succeeded Damian Bertrand last month. Bertrand is now chairman of the brand and has moved to become deputy CEO of Louis Vuitton. This is only the latest luxury brand to incur in such a probe. Dior, also part of LVMH, and the Giorgio Armani Group have also been investigated for allegedly using suppliers who subjected workers to poor conditions, including inadequate wages, and potentially misleading consumers about their commitment to ethical standards, labor practices and artisanal production. Both brands have seen the judicial administration procedures lifted after taking steps to improve their supply chain and labor practices. In February, a Milan court ordered the revocation of the judicial administration imposed since April last year on Giorgio Armani Operations, a unit of the namesake designer's fashion group, over the labor practices of its Chinese-owned subcontractors. At the time, the Armani Group said in a statement that the decision to revoke the judicial administration was made because the company has taken all the necessary corrective action and “already had a structured and tested system of controls and protection of its supply chain.” The revocation came ahead of the one-year deadline initially expected, it pointed out. The statement underscored that the decision was also made because the court recognized the group's craftsmanship as Armani's suppliers “are often to be identified as highly qualified artisans, especially regarding Italian production, characterized by the highest level of sophistication and quality.” Last year, judges also placed an Italian subsidiary of Dior, which produced handbags for the French brand, under the same form of special administration, again for lack of control over its supply chain. In May, the French fashion house was cleared of any wrongdoing and said it remains “committed to upholding our values of transparency and respect throughout our supply chain. This further underscores the maison's steadfast and historic dedication to pursuing both rigorous Made in Italy products and the highest standards of ethics and excellence.” Alviero Martini was also investigated over alleged worker exploitation, and in May, a unit of Valentino specialized in bags was placed under judicial administration for a year by the Milan court after worker abuse was uncovered at subcontractors. Following the move, Valentino said it had intensified its supplier evaluation process across its supply chain in recent years and would cooperate with the relevant authorities to “fully understand the circumstances that have led to the measures taken by the judiciary in this specific case.”"

mov_278BBB9A1E3B538A87994681A7A95DBF,2025-07-15 00:22:51,en,WEB,"  By Emilio Parodi MILAN (Reuters) -Cashmere king Loro Piana, part of LVMH's luxury empire, became on Monday the fifth high-end brand to be put under judicial administration in Italy over worker abuses in supply chains, after an investigation that has tainted the image of Italian luxury goods. Loro Piana Spa will undergo court monitoring for a year, according to the 26-page ruling reviewed by Reuters, which stems from investigations into the world of subcontracting for luxury goods in Italy that started in 2023. As in previous cases involving Italian luxury firms, the administration may end earlier if the company brings its practices into line with legal requirements. In a statement, Loro Piana blamed a supplier for sub-contracting work without informing it, breaching legal and contractual obligations, and said it had ended work with the supplier as soon as it found out in May. The case involving Loro Piana Spa originated after Carabinieri police from the Milan labour protection unit in May arrested a Chinese workshop owner and closed his factory in the northwestern suburbs of Milan. The employer was reported by one of his workers for beating him, causing injuries that required 45 days of treatment, after the worker demanded 10,000 euros ($11,692.00) in unpaid wages. Carabinieri police found that the workshop produced Loro Piana-branded cashmere jackets and that its 10 Chinese labourers, including five illegal immigrants, were forced to work up to 90 hours a week, seven days a week, were paid 4 euros an hour, and slept in rooms illegally set up inside the factory. Units of fashion brands Valentino, LVMH's second largest brand Dior, Italy's Armani, and Italian handbag company Alviero Martini were previously placed under administration for similar alleged worker exploitation. The Court of Milan found that Loro Piana, which makes expensive cashmere clothing, subcontracted its production through two front firms that had no actual manufacturing capacity to Chinese-owned workshops in Italy. The owners of the contracting and subcontracting companies were put under investigation for exploiting workers and employing people off the books, while Loro Piana Spa itself faces no criminal probe. The company said in its statement it ""has been constantly reviewing and will continue to strengthen its control and audit activities "" to ensure compliance with its own quality and ethical standards across the supply chain. LVMH, the world's biggest luxury group, acquired 80% of Loro Piana in 2013, leaving 20% to the company's founding family. In June, Loro Piana appointed Frederic Arnault, son of LVMH chairman and Chief Executive Bernard Arnault, as CEO. WORKER ABUSE AT SUBCONTRACTORS The Milan court, as in the cases of the other brands targeted by the investigation, found Loro Piana ""culpably failed "" to adequately oversee its suppliers in order to pursue higher profits, according to the ruling. The prosecutors in the case said the violation of rules among fashion companies in Italy was ""a generalised and consolidated manufacturing method Experience from past investigations ""indicates that the complete outsourcing of industrial production processes is aimed exclusively at reducing labour costs and, consequently, also the criminal and administrative liability of the company with regard to worker safety... All this is done with a view to maximising profits at the lowest possible production cost, "" the Court of Milan said. Italy is home to thousands of small manufacturers that make up 50%-55% of global luxury goods production, consultancy Bain has calculated. In May, Italy's fashion brands signed an accord with legal and political authorities to fight worker exploitation, but the ruling on Loro Piana said ""this production chain, headed by Loro Piana, has continued to operate until now "" and despite the previous cases being widely reported. Carabinieri police said in a statement they inspected two intermediary companies and three Chinese workshops, all in the Milan area, and identified 21 workers, 10 of whom were working off the books without proper registration, including seven illegal immigrants. According to the court ruling, the owner of an intermediary company stated that in recent years she had been producing around 6,000-7,000 jackets per year for Loro Piana at an agreed price of 118 euros per jacket if the order was for more than 100 items and 128 euros if the order was under 100 items. ""The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier, nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics, "" the company said. On the Loro Piana website, prices for men's cashmere jackets range from over 3,000 euros to over 5,000 euros. ($1 = 0.8553 euros) (Reporting by Emilio Parodi; Additional reporting by Elisa Anzolin and Alvise Armellini; Editing by Keith Weir, Susan Fenton and Deepa Babington)"

This scent is gorgeous. Smells a bit sweet but not overly sweet, not super vanilla, just a hint of it with sophistication. Very soft and sultry. I applied moisturizer (thin, thin layer of Vaseline) and then sprayed perfume. It stayed on my skin for probably over eight hours. I checked my sweater the next day, you could easily smell it on my sweater. Definitely worth the money."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $29+ (available in two sizes). 3.

Promising review: ""I recently tried the Olay Super Serum Body Wash, and I am absolutely in love with it! The formula is incredibly hydrating, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth after every use. It lathers beautifully and has a lovely, light fragrance that isn't overpowering. After just a few uses, I noticed my skin looked more radiant and felt deeply moisturized. The addition of serums in the body wash is a game changer. My skin feels nourished, and I no longer need to apply lotion right after showering.

mov_72986CA310AC3B29CFD8ABD43F4EE16C,2025-07-15 03:56:01,en,WEB,"  The biggest airport serving Italy's fashion capital of Milan has strengthened its high-end retail offer by introducing French heavyweights Dior and Louis Vuitton to anchor its luxury line-up with the largest boutiques at the gateway. Milan Malpensa Airport—which handled almost 30 million passengers last year, up 11%—is continuing its strategy of establishing itself as a premier European destination for high-end shopping. The operator, SEA Milan Airports, which also runs the smaller airport of Milan Linate, is stepping up its luxury offer in line with the city's rising popularity as a place to shop tax-free. According to tax refund specialist Global Blue, between December 2024 and February 2025), Milan accounted for 9% of total tax-free sales in Continental Europe with an average spend of €2,240 ($2,615), bettered only by Paris with a 22% share and average spending of €2,660 ($3,105). Both the Dior and Louis Vuitton boutiques are directly operated by the brands and have significant footprints at about 4,800 and 6,100 square feet, respectively. They take the number of luxury brands at Malpensa to 22, not including various corners and pop-ups within Avolta's large duty-free stores at the airport. The two new arrivals are strategically located in one of the most prominent areas of Terminal 1, and their eye-catching storefronts are now the first to be seen by passengers as they exit the security area into the retail spaces. Other big-name boutiques in T1 include Armani, Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Bulgari, Damiani, Hermès, Ferragamo, Moncler, Tod's and Zegna, many of them centered around a Davide Oldani Cafè. Luigi Battuello, chief commercial officer of SEA, commented: “With the arrival of Dior and Louis Vuitton, Malpensa cements its status as a benchmark for premium airport shopping. The investment by these iconic brands reflects our vision of an increasingly international, modern gateway—credible to partners and attentive to the needs of global travellers.” Milan lures global luxury shoppers Last year, T1 had the most international passengers of any SEA terminal and/or airports at 30%. European passengers accounted for 21%, North Americans 4%, and North Mediterranean Africa and the Middle East passengers, 2%. Intercontinental air traffic at Malpensa has been growing again and should support Dior and Louis Vuitton, both of which have been expanding at key hub airport like Qatar's Hamad International and others. In the first five months of 2025, luxury sales increased by a solid 18% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by the rise in high-spending international travelers. Average transaction value also rose by more than 9% year-over-year. This builds on an already strong 2024 for luxury, which was up a very healthy 21%. As with most airports in Europe, high-end retail sales drivers are non-European Union passengers, particularly from Asia and the Middle East. They account for over 80% of luxury purchases. T1 is, by far, the strongest terminal for non-EU customers. In 2024, across the SEA network (Malpensa and Linate combined), sales rose by 15% reaching record commercial revenue of €470 million ($550 million). Food and beverage ticked up higher at 16.6%. Malpensa has created a high-end commercial district at the airport, claiming to have a shopping experience “on par” with Milan's downtown Quadrilatero della Moda fashion district, where streets like Via Monte Napoleone are world famous and a magnet for luxury shoppers from all over the world. Global Blue ranks Milan ahead of Florence and Rome as the most strategic destination for international travel shopping in Italy. The fashion capital benefits from Italy's global reputation for fashion and craftsmanship, although this is being tarnished by scrutiny into alleged abuse of workers through subcontracting practices. Loro Piana, an LVMH house known for cashmere items, became the fifth high-end label in Italy to be put under judicial administration following investigations that started in 2023."
b1dfd1b0350221469baa074ac989244d,2025-07-15 04:24:00,en,WEB,"  LVMH's Labor Crisis: How ESG Failures Threaten the Luxury Giant's Crown The luxury sector's golden age of unchecked opulence is fading. As investors increasingly demand accountability for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) practices, brands like LVMH—once synonymous with exclusivity—are facing existential risks tied to their supply chains. Recent revelations about labor violations at LVMH subsidiaries Loro Piana and Dior expose systemic ESG compliance failures that could undermine the group's premium pricing power and long-term profitability. For ESG-driven investors, this is a wake-up call: the allure of luxury no longer justifies ignoring the human cost of production. The Anatomy of Systemic ESG Failure LVMH's subsidiaries have become poster children for the dark underbelly of luxury manufacturing. In Italy, Loro Piana's supply chain was revealed to rely on subcontractors operating in near-total opacity. Courts found the brand “culpably failed” to monitor its subcontractors, enabling workshops to exploit workers with unsafe conditions, wage theft, and illegal labor practices. The Milan court's unprecedented judicial administration—a year-long oversight—signals a regulatory turning point: luxury brands can no longer externalize accountability. The scale of exploitation is staggering. Loro Piana's subcontractors paid workers as little as €4 per finished piece, while retail prices for its cashmere jackets soared to €3,000. Retailers pocketed margins exceeding 90%, yet workers endured 90-hour weeks and violence for unpaid wages. Even after a 2024 industry agreement to curb exploitation, prosecutors labeled these practices a “generalized and consolidated manufacturing method” across Italy's luxury sector, which produces 55% of global luxury goods. Reputational Risk: The Silent Killer of Brand Equity For LVMH, the stakes are existential. Its €83 billion market cap hinges on perceived exclusivity and ethical superiority. Yet repeated violations—from Loro Piana's subcontractor abuses to Dior's 2023 judicial administration—undermine its “exceptional” brand narrative. The market has already reacted: LVMH's stock has dropped 22% year-to-date as of July 2025 ( Investors should note: brand equity is fragile. A single scandal can erode decades of reputation. Consider the backlash against fast fashion giants like Zara and H&M: consumers increasingly associate unethical practices with diminished value. For LVMH, this could force it to compete on price—a death knell for a brand built on scarcity. The Regulatory Sword of Damocles Italian courts are now wielding unprecedented leverage. Loro Piana's subcontractors face €181,000 in fines and two workshops were shuttered, while Dior's €2 million fine to exploited workers underscores that legal costs are mounting. Worse, these penalties may pale compared to the reputational damage. Younger, ESG-conscious consumers—critical to future growth—are already pivoting to competitors like Hermès, which outperformed LVMH in sales and stock price growth despite its smaller scale. The broader ESG landscape is tightening. Institutional investors, including BlackRock and Vanguard, now tie executive compensation to ESG targets. For LVMH, its failure to address supply chain opacity could trigger ESG downgrades, raising borrowing costs and limiting access to green financing. A Call for ESG Due Diligence in Luxury Investing Investors must recalibrate their risk frameworks. The LVMH case reveals three critical lessons: - Supply Chain Visibility is Non-Negotiable: Brands without end-to-end transparency—like Loro Piana's opaque subcontracting—face ESG-related valuation discounts. - Regulatory Risk is Compounding: Italy's judicial actions signal a global shift toward holding parent companies accountable for subcontractor abuses. - Ethical Competitors Are Winning: Hermès' €1.2 billion sales growth in 2024, despite its stringent supply chain controls, proves that ethical practices can drive premium pricing. Investment Strategy: Avoid LVMH, Favor ESG Leaders For ESG-driven investors: - Avoid LVMH: Its systemic governance failures and declining stock price reflect unsustainable risks. - Favor Hermès: Its vertically integrated model and strict supplier oversight exemplify ESG resilience. - Demand Transparency: Engage with luxury brands to adopt blockchain-based supply chain tracking and third-party audits. The luxury sector's future belongs to those who can marry exclusivity with accountability. LVMH's crisis is a cautionary tale: in an era of ESG scrutiny, opulence built on exploitation is unsustainable. Final Take: Investors should treat LVMH's labor scandals as a red flag. Until the group overhauls its supply chain governance, its valuation risks further erosion. The luxury sector's next chapter will be written by those who prioritize ethics as much as elegance.

mov_7FF3B66C777EBAE5656F10EF1591252E,2025-07-15 05:05:00,en,WEB,"  Findings from YipitData show that TikTok Shop and Target are neck-and-neck by fragrance sales; Kayali is number one at Sephora, and more. July 15, 2025, 1:05am Macy's may be holding on to its longtime position as the top U.S. retailer by share of fragrance sales, but plenty of other shifts are afoot when it comes to who's winning the category. According to YipitData, Macy's accounted for 31.8 percent of fragrance sales during the month of May, indicating a 14.7-point lead from the category's next-biggest retailer during the period, Ulta Beauty. While significant, that lead is several points less than it was, say, two years prior in 2023, when Macy's accounted for more than 40 percent of fragrance sales during the same month. This shift is in part due to the nascent growth of alternative fragrance retailers as formidable competitors in the space. There's Amazon, which, per YipitData, accounted for 14.9 percent of fragrance sales in May across the platform's first- and third-party sellers (tracking after Sephora, which accounted for 15.5 percent during the same period). TikTok Shop, too, wasn't on the map at all in the U.S. until halfway through 2023, yet today the e-tailer — which has propelled brands from Lattafa to Phlur to virality — goes head-to-head with Target in terms of share of fragrance sales, actually outpacing Target slightly in May. Year-to-date, the top three fragrance brands at Sephora have been Kayali, Sol de Janeiro and YSL Beauty, in that order. For the month of May, Valentino overtook YSL for the number-three spot, while in April, Chanel's Chance Eau Splendide Eau de Parfum was the retailer's top-selling new stock keeping unit across the store. On Amazon, which YipitData reports has gained modest but steady share in fragrance since 2023, winning brands range from value-driven to designer, a dynamic which the platform's top two brands in May — Lattafa and Versace — quintessentially represent. Other top 10 brands on Amazon include Sol de Janeiro, Nautica and Dior (which, like all brands owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, does not officially sell on the platform). So far in 2025, fragrance has been the fastest-growing category in beauty, as has been the case since 2021. According to Circana, the category grew 4 percent in the prestige market and 8 percent in mass during the first quarter of this year. The top 10 retailers by share of fragrance sales in May 2025, per YipitData. 1. Macy's 31.8 percent 2. Ulta Beauty 17.1 percent 3. Sephora 15.5 percent 4. Amazon 14.9 percent (including first- and third-party sellers) 5. Nordstrom 5.5 percent 6. Walmart 4.7 percent 7. Kohl's 3.7 percent 8. TikTok Shop 2.4 percent 9. Target 2.3 percent 10.

mov_3669BA82B1B3CD13C135502499F3F431,2025-07-15 06:00:49,en,WEB,"  LVMH shareholders have endured a torrid 2025 so far, with the French luxury group's stock market value sinking by a quarter over the last six months. The group, which counts Louis Vuitton, Dior and Givenchy among its stable of fashion brands, has seen shares sink by almost a third over the last 12 months as the global luxury rebound has probed sluggish. Last week Louis Vuitton announced it was targeted by a cyberattack for the third time in the past three months at the beginning of July, after Marks & Spencer, the Co-op and Harrods were all targeted earlier this year. Meanwhile, LVMH's drinks division, Moët Hennessy, is being gripped by a €1.3million court case brought by Maria Gasparovic, former chief of staff to executive Jean-Marc Lacave, who was sacked four months after reporting alleged sexual misconduct by senior colleagues. Despite these recent tribulations for the firm, analysts think shares could be due a rebound. LVMH revenues contracted 3 per cent to €20.3billion in the first quarter, from €20.7billion a year ago, well below analyst forecasts for sales growth of 2 per cent. Revenue in the firm's wines and spirits division, headed up by its Moët and Hennessy brands, declined 9 per cent to €1.3billion. Its largest category, fashion and leather goods, saw sales fall 5 per cent to €10.1billion, from €10.5billion previously. The firm, which was the first in its sector to post figures after the Donald Trump's 'liberation day' tariff announcements, said: 'In a disrupted geopolitical and economic environment, LVMH remains both vigilant and confident at the start of the year.' The French firm, which has a market capitalisation of almost €250billion, owns 75 luxury brands. It will publish its results for the first half of its 2025 financial year on 24 July. It isn't just LVMH that is feeling the pinch, the entire luxury sector is facing a similar downturn. After a post-pandemic peak that saw luxury brands surge on the back of huge demand, external pressures such as geopolitical uncertainty and economic slowdown have precipitated a downturn across the sector. During the course of 2024, the market dipped from €369billion to €364billion, according to figures from Bain & Company, with weaker demand, especially from China and the US, pushing the shrink. American luxury demand was down around 10 per cent in 2024 compared to its peak in 2022, according to data from Morningstar, while Chinese demand has slipped a quarter in compared with its pre-pandemic high point. Even so, LVMH has suffered a worse fate than many, with the firm underperforming luxury peers. Morningstar analysts said LVMH is currently trading below the broker's value estimate of €620 per share. At midday on Thursday, LVMH shares were trading at €496.05 per share. Since January, LVMH shares have fallen some 34 per cent, and was surpassed in value by Hermes, which became the largest luxury goods firm in April. Morningstar says this is a normalisation after the post pandemic boom, during which the firm said LVMH's valuation was stretched. At the time, LVMH was operating on a price to earnings ratio of 26. Now, having seen its share price half, its PE ratio on a one year rolling basis now stands at 20.2, according to figures form Stockopedia. In comparison, the new king of luxury, Hermes, is operating on a PE ratio of 50.8. Likewise, a number of other luxury goods firms have significantly larger PE ratios than LVMH, with Burberry standing at 48.2, EssilorLuxotica at 33.1 and Kering at 26.7. Jelena Sokolova, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said: 'We have seen luxury sector slowdowns many times before, but this time LVMH's valuation has been unfairly hit. 'The retailer is trading at its lowest forward earnings multiple in seven years and roughly half that of comparable wide-moat peers, which presents an opportunity for investors.' Morningstar added: 'Forward earnings multiples are at the lowest for the last seven years and are meaningfully below peers, offering around 30 per cent upside to our fair value estimate.' However, others argue that LVMH's downturn is far from an unfair reflection on the rest of the business. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, however, told This is Money: 'LVMH has lost its sparkle after a series of setbacks in recent years. It has focused too much on the aspirational market and these types of buyers have become more cash-conscious, watching their pennies rather than opening their wallets without a care in the world. 'In contrast, Hermes has explicitly focused on the ultra-rich and has enjoyed more resilient trading. LVMH might now be thinking hard about narrowing its customer focus as that could help to make its products more desirable, which is ultimately what luxury goods is all about.' LVMH still has exceptional brand strength, which Morningstar says will give it the edge against its peers. The group's brands making up 29 per cent of the luxury leather market, compared to just 8 per cent for Hermes. The firm's impressive storefronts and higher capital spending on retail may help its brands to stand out from their competition. The strength of the brand remains, with LVMH having seen fashion and leather sales grow slightly better than the wider sector last year, though this dipped in the first quarter of 2025. Coatsworth, however, said: 'LVMH has too many different interests. We're in an environment where companies are focusing on what they do best and jettisoning non-core assets. LVMH would be better if it just focused on fashion and got rid of the Sephora and DFS retail arms and its various food and drink operations.' LVMH's brand strength, unwieldy though it may be, could combine with the potential for an upswing in the sector after the slowdown of the past few years. Morningstar's Sokolova certainly thinks this is the case. She told This is Money: 'We expect the luxury industry to return to growth after the current - and last year's - slowdown, driven by normalisation of demand in the US as post-pandemic excess spending is flushed out - a trend we've seen since 2023 - and as Chinese real estate prices stabilize, boosting consumer sentiment. ' LVMH derives around 24 per cent of its sales from the US, where consumer sending has also stalled. Morningstar said: 'We estimate that post-pandemic excesses have been flushed out of the market, US luxury consumption should come back to growth from more normal levels. We expect US GDP to hold up stronger in the long term.' China accounts for a significant portion of LVMH's sales, with Asia (excluding Japan), accounting for 30 per cent of LVMH sales. China's economy is currently in a period of slow growth, with consumers remaining tight on spending. In the first quarter, LVMH revenue from China fell by 11 per cent, with the second quarter expected to follow suit. Sokolova said: 'Many Chinese spenders are still sitting on substantial savings following the pandemic. We expect LVMH to outperform the industry growth longer-term thanks to strength of the brands and substantial marketing budget...."

mov_09DECB1C312976B62B0F7BBBBB50E8D8,2025-07-15 09:23:55,en,WEB,"  Link to Story The Asia Luxury Goods Market is projected to grow from USD 135.25 billion in 2024 to USD 192.17 billion by 2033, reflecting a CAGR of 3.98%. Driving factors include rising disposable incomes, increased brand consciousness, and a burgeoning middle class in China, India, and Japan. Enhanced digital shopping and travel also boost demand for premium brands. Challenges like counterfeit goods and economic volatility persist. Key sectors include luxury clothing, footwear, and watches. Major players like LVMH and Rolex are leveraging digital platforms and responding to evolving consumer trends to capture growth opportunities in this vibrant market.Dublin, July 15, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Asia Luxury Goods Market Share Analysis and Size - Growth Trends and Forecast Report 2025-2033"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Asia Luxury Goods Market is anticipated to see massive growth, increasing from USD 135.25 billion in 2024 to USD 192.17 billion by 2033, with a CACR of 3.98%. The development is driven by increasing disposable income, increased brand consciousness, and an increasing middle-class population in nations like China, India, and Japan. Enhanced digital shopping channels and travel are also increasing the demand for high-end and premium luxury brands in the market. Luxury products command a wide popularity base with strong demand in regions such as Asia, North America, and Europe. In the past few years, new markets such as China, India, and the Middle East have seen growth at a fast rate because of increasing disposable incomes and online luxury consumption. Luxury products are not only consumed for personal use but also as gifts, investments, and collectibles. The shift towards experiential luxury, such as travel and personalized services, also reflects international luxury consumers' evolving tastes. Drivers of Growth in the Asia Luxury Goods Market Rising Middle Class and Disposable Incomes Asia's increasing middle class is fueling the luxury goods industry. With rising disposable income, customers are seeking premium products as symbols of prestige and markers of individual achievement. China and India are witnessing a surge in high-income consumers who value quality and brand prestige highly. This demographic shift is expanding the customer base for luxury products, leading to increased sales and market penetration in the region. Nearly 65% of the middle class will reside in Asia by 2030, approximately 3.5 billion people. Digital Transformation and E-commerce Expansion The rapid rise of digital technologies has reshaped the Asian luxury retail environment. E-commerce sites and social media platforms are now vital marketing channels for brands to engage with consumers, especially younger generations. Online sales of luxury products are on the rise, as brands are spending in digital showrooms, live-streamed experiences, and custom-made digital experiences to drive maximum customer engagement and sales. Lancome, an L'Oreal group, introduced Lancome Happiness Nights initially in 2021 by offering a live-in-experience immersion from its store on Paris's Champs-Elysees. Dior offered access to its VIP July 2022 fashion show and the possibility of discussing 'live' with make-up specialists and getting guidance on beauty tips. Live-shopping will be accounting for about 20% of worldwide online purchases by 2026, McKinsey finds in the wake of a survey. Tourism and Duty-Free Shopping Tourism plays a significant role in driving the Asian luxury market. Japan and South Korea, among other nations, receive tourists who propel luxury sales via duty-free shopping. The appeal of tax-free buys and carefully selected merchandise available at airports and tourist areas boosts luxury sales. Additionally, the restart of international travel as a result of the decline of the pandemic will also propel this segment. For instance, as reported by the industry, duty-free sales in Japan generated USD 450.7 Million in May 2024, where duty-free products totaling around 566,000 purchases were made by shoppers, whose products mainly included high-value duty-free items such as luxury bags and jewelry. Challenges in the Asia Luxury Goods Market Counterfeit Products and Brand Dilution The explosion of counterfeit luxury goods poses a significant risk to brand reputation and consumer trust. Pirated versions, offered at lower prices, devalue brands and deter prospective customers. Luxury brands need to invest in anti-counterfeiting measures, including blockchain technology and authentication services, to protect their reputation and maintain product authenticity. Economic Uncertainty and Market Volatility Economic fluctuations such as currency devaluation and inflation may influence consumer spending on luxury goods. For instance, China's luxury market slowed down in 2024 with reduced domestic spending and increased tourist shopping abroad. Such volatility necessitates luxury brands to be agile, adapting strategies to make them robust during economic downturns. Asia Luxury Clothing and Apparel Market Asia's luxury apparel and clothing segment is growing strongly, fueled by fashion-oriented consumers seeking high-end, designer clothing. Urban lifestyles and exposure to international fashion have influenced behavior, triggering demand for luxury clothing. The response is from companies introducing regional products and collaborations with local designers to address the diversity of tastes in Asian markets. Asia Luxury Footwear Market Asia's luxury footwear market is expanding, fueled by increasing disposable incomes and an increasing passion for superior craftsmanship. Customers are spending money on high-quality footwear that provides both style and comfort...."

In a statement, the carabinieri police said the company had been deemed “incapable of preventing or curbing labour exploitation within the production cycle by failing to implement adequate measures to verify the actual working conditions or the technical capacities of its contractors”. An investigation found the fashion house entrusted the production of its clothing, including cashmere jackets, to a company without production facilities. That firm outsourced the work to another company, which in turn used workshops in Italy employing Chinese workers to save costs, the statement said. In these workshops, irregular workers were exploited without respecting health and safety rules, particularly regarding wages, working hours, breaks and holidays, investigators found. The judges of the Milan court found that Loro Piana “negligently facilitated” the exploitation, according to the police statement. The court however stressed that the one-year administration was intended as “preventative”, not a punishment, according to the court document seen by AFP. It was aimed at “combating the unlawful contamination of healthy businesses by subjecting them to judicial oversight” where they can be removed from “criminal infiltration”. In a statement, Loro Piana said it had terminated ties with its supplier within 24 hours of discovering the existence of its subcontractors on May 20, and was fully cooperating with authorities. “Loro Piana strongly condemns any illegal practices and reaffirms its ongoing commitment to protecting human rights and complying with all applicable regulations throughout its entire supply chain,” it said. The investigation began in May following a complaint from a Chinese worker who claimed he was beaten by his boss after demanding payment of back wages, police said. The police carried out inspections in factories run by Chinese citizens in the area surrounding Milan, finding violations of workplace rules as well as illegally built dormitories and unsanitary conditions. Proceedings were brought against two Chinese nationals who owned workshops, two Italians for violations of workplace health and safety standards, and seven workers without residence permits. The court also imposed fines totalling over 181,000 euros ($211,000) and administrative penalties of around 60,000 euros. The operations of two Chinese workshops were also suspended “for serious safety violations and the use of undeclared labour”, the police statement said. Loro Piana was acquired by LVMH in 2013, and is currently led by Frederic Arnault, son of LVMH chairman Bernard Arnault. The company did not comment on the proceedings in Milan. The Italian justice system has already carried out similar proceedings against other fashion houses including Armani. In May, the Italian competition authority cleared luxury brand Dior — also owned by LVMH — of violations in working conditions but required it to pay a two-million-euro fine towards “victims of exploitation”.

mov_AB34AD1DAD0D80CA6EBDC37C7117EF20,2025-07-15 12:57:06,en,WEB,"  In the world of luxury fashion, the “Made in Italy” label has traditionally carried with it a unique prestige. Synonymous with quality, craftsmanship, and tradition, it evokes images of Tuscan leather workshops, master artisans, and time-honored techniques. But a rising number of recent developments suggest that the reality behind the “Made in Italy” moniker is far more complex than the heritage-infused marketing messaging that brands have long relied upon. Just this week, a Milan court placed Loro Piana under judicial administration, raising critical questions about what the “Made in Italy” label actually guarantees in today's fashion economy. Known for its eye-wateringly expensive vicuña knitwear and its white-soled loafers, the LVMH-owned brand joins a growing list of fashion houses placed under judicial oversight by the Milan Tribunal. According to the court's ruling, the “quiet luxury” brand subcontracted garment production to unauthorized workshops accused of labor exploitation and unsafe working conditions. Though Loro Piana is not criminally charged, the court found it had “culpably failed” to monitor its supply chain, effectively prioritizing profit over legal and ethical compliance. This is not an isolated incident. Other brands – including units of Valentino, LVMH-owned Christian Dior, Giorgio Armani, and Alviero Martini – have also come under scrutiny. The court's findings in these cases often point to a recurring issue: unauthorized subcontracting to workshops, many operated by undocumented Chinese laborers within Italy, often under exploitative conditions. A Decade of Exposés & a System Under Strain Labor abuses have been quietly plaguing Italy's fashion manufacturing ecosystem for at least two decades. In 2007, the Italian news program Report aired a now-notorious episode, titled Luxury Slaves, which detailed how high-end Italian products were allegedly being made under sweatshop conditions in factories operated by Chinese immigrants. The program described environments rife with wage violations, unsafe working conditions, and tax evasion. Just months later, the Los Angeles Times published its own investigation, Slaving in the Lap of Luxury, implicating brands like Dolce & Gabbana, Gucci, and Prada in a system where Italian labor laws were routinely flouted. Despite a legal minimum wage of over $10 per hour, workers were being paid as little as $5, with many lacking legal documentation and enduring harsh conditions in makeshift factory-lodging hybrids. The backlash to these reports was swift but largely superficial. While the exposés prompted public outcry and some regulatory attention, the underlying systems of clandestine labor persisted. Government raids temporarily shut down noncompliant workshops, and luxury brands issued public statements of concern or denied involvement. However, long-term structural change has proved elusive. The informal economy in cities like Prato continued to flourish, often adapting more quickly than regulators could respond, and sources suggest that many of the same workshops exposed years ago were simply reincarnated under new names or run by associates of shuttered operations. Meanwhile, fashion and mainstream luxury giants' reliance on flexibility, speed, and hefty margins has incentivized outsourcing to third-party suppliers, creating layers of insulation between brands and the labor abuses on which they quietly depend. Reconsidering the Label The implications of these revelations are profound. For consumers, the assumption that “Made in Italy” equates to fair labor, artisanal quality, and ethical production no longer holds unchallenged. For regulators and brands, the label's symbolic weight now comes with increased scrutiny and legal risk. Italy's recent spate of judicial interventions signals a more aggressive stance against abusive subcontracting practices. In May 2025, in a bid to address the systemic nature of these issues, Italian courts, regional authorities, trade unions, and industry groups signed a voluntary agreement to increase supply chain transparency. The pact introduced a centralized supplier registry, transparency certifications, and compliance guidelines, aiming to preempt further court interventions. While it reflects institutional awareness and a willingness to reform, critics argue the agreement lacks legal enforceability, wage protections, and mandatory participation – making it a starting point rather than a structural solution. Until meaningful reforms are enacted, such as tighter oversight of supply chains and more precise legal definitions for origin labeling, “Made in Italy” will continue to function not only as a marketing tool and a smokescreen, but also as a source of potential reputational risk and legal fallout. A Pricing & Positioning Reckoning The reputational impact of these labor scandals extends beyond compliance and into the core economic model of luxury fashion. Brand value and pricing power in this sector depend heavily on perceived authenticity, provenance, and ethical distinction. When the “Made in Italy” designation becomes associated with exploitative labor practices rather than artisanal excellence, the premium that consumers are willing to pay becomes harder to justify. In legal-economic terms, luxury pricing is sustained not simply by input costs or production limitations but by intangible assets – brand equity, consumer trust, and symbolic capital. When these are undermined by judicial findings and media scrutiny, companies may find their market positioning eroded and their pricing strategies increasingly difficult to defend. The risk is twofold: not only do such scandals create reputational damage, but they may also attract regulatory scrutiny under laws governing origin claims, supply chain transparency, and labor protections. To maintain both legal defensibility and economic viability, brands will need to transition from narrative-driven marketing to evidence-based verification. That may involve vertical integration, third-party audits, or legally binding supplier accountability frameworks. In an era of increasing transparency, the sustainability of luxury margins will be determined not just by aesthetics or heritage, but by legal compliance and operational traceability."

From the Pepsi/Peeps collab to the Van Leeuwen/Kraft Macaroni & Cheese and the Sour Patch Kids and Post cereal, these partnerships — three of the best, according to Advertising Week — leveraged each brand's strength to create something new that fans of both brands loved. Over the years, limited-edition cereals inspired by childhood cartoons, soda flavors based on video games, and snacks tied to movie franchises have emerged. They all have one thing in common: They target loyal fans and generate buzz on social media. People love these kinds of products because they're relatively inexpensive (unlike the Disney/Gucci or Nike/Christian Dior collabs) and tap into a cherished childhood memory. When the fandom is as massive and devoted as Harry Potter's, the potential is enormous, at least that's what Nestlé's newest release is banking on. Coffee Mate isn't new to flavor experiments but this one is different The first Harry Potter book was published 28 years ago, so fans of the books and the movies that followed are all of prime coffee drinking age. Starting in August, Coffee Mate will roll out two limited-time creamers inspired by the Wizarding World: Cauldron Cake and White Chocolate Peppermint Toad (Zero Sugar). The flavors are the brand's first-ever official tie-in with the Harry Potter franchise and promise to bring a little magic to your morning cup. Related: Trader Joe's sells out of TikTok famous treat (here's when it's back) Nestlé's Coffee Mate  (NESAF)  brand is no stranger to wild flavor experiments — from basic sweet cream to indulgent Oreo collabs, the flavors make coffee anything but boring. But now, the company is tapping into one of the most powerful fandoms in pop culture with a new limited-time release that's already stirring up major buzz. For longtime fans, Cauldron Cake is a direct nod to a beloved treat sold at Honeydukes, the enchanted candy shop in the Harry Potter books and theme parks. Coffee Mate's take is described as a buttery, vanilla-toffee creamer that turns your cup of coffee into a dessert-like experience — no spellcasting required. More Retail: Lowe's launches massive early answer to Amazon Prime Day Target has new plan to win back customers with big savings Home Depot makes clear statement amid boycott threats Famous retail chain makes two more alarming store closures The second flavor, White Chocolate Peppermint Toad, takes inspiration from another whimsical sweet and adds a wintery twist. With a blend of cool peppermint and creamy white chocolate — and no sugar — it's a bold choice for a summer launch, but one that plays into the fantasy feel. Tapping into childhood memories is a winning strategy This isn't the first time a big brand has leaned into nostalgic crossovers. In recent months, Goldfish crackers introduced a Butterbeer flavor, and Universal theme parks have continued to expand their Harry Potter-themed food offerings. But Coffee Mate's move stands out because it brings the magic into an everyday routine. Related: Starbucks May Have Finally Found the Perfect Cold Foam It also comes at a time when brands are doubling down on nostalgia to boost grocery sales. If you're a die-hard Harry Potter fan, or are just tired of French vanilla and hazelnut, these magical mix-ins are sure to catch your eye — and they're sure to fly off the shelves faster than a Nimbus 2000. Both flavors will be available at major grocery retailers nationwide for a limited time starting in August 2025. Related: Starbucks considers massive menu change for unlikely reason"

1m0k6i8,2025-07-15 15:04:50,en,REDDIT,"  While the world was busy with Amazon Prime Day and Flipkart sale(I did end up buying Bose Quiet Comfort Ultra Headphones and Logitech G29 Racing Wheel), I decided to pull the trigger on the fragrance which got me into this world - Creed Aventus and added a bunch of others to my ever-growing collection (attaching pics of the new purchases and the overall collection as well) BACKGROUND (Might be a slightly lengthy storytime, I recommend reading through the non-sense but feel free to skip to the review section if you want): I got into fragrances through my flatmate. He had a 200ML Dior Sauvage which I liked. I started researching the top fragrances and found the man, the myth, the legend: Jeremy Fragrance. Creed Aventus was a regular part of his videos and I was always intrigued by it. I managed to get my nose on it in airports and offline stores and loved it, but always found it to be too expensive for what was being offered. That was a time I was big on clones and thought they offer the same value as the 20k niche brands. But as we all experience in our fragrance journeys, there comes a time when the clones start to smell cheap and we start appreciating the quality and nuance we get by paying that extra amount of money for designer or niche fragrances. Soon clones smell alcoholic and synthetic, no matter the brand and that's the stage I'm in, where CDNIN doesn't do the job anymore. The day finally came, when I pulled the trigger on my fragrance journey ever-present aspiration of Creed Aventus and graduated in my fragrance journey finally REVIEW: 1. Creed Aventus (F batch): The smoky pineapple DNA still gets me. Amazing pineapple opening. Projects heavily for the first 4 hours. Drys down to a smoky pineapple smell and lasts 6-8 hours on skin and 12 hours on clothes. Still an amazing compliment puller and an all occasion, all weather scent. Love the smell, got a ton of compliments in office and highly recommend. The quality and finesse of the original cannot be replicated by any of the clones out there and I've tried them all. Still a beast mode fragrance. 10/10 will recommend if you have the budget 2. Kilian Roses on Ice: Have been obsessed with this DNA since a few months. Smells like a fresh cucumber with a gin and tonic touch to it. Super fresh and uplifting. Perfect for summers and monsoon. Again, an expensive fragrance, recommend this only if you have extra money lying around. Projects and lasts like a beast, as expected from a high quality brand like Kilian 3. Fraganote After Shave: All Fraganote fragrances have magnetic caps and amazing bottles with one of the best pressurized atomisers I've seen. I bought this thinking it'll be like Old Spice, and though it shares some similarities, it's still it's own blend. An original creation and not a clone of anything. Proud and amazed by Fraganote for sticking to creating original scents profiles and not succumbing to being a clone house, as most brands tend to do at this price point. Coming to the fragrance, a nice clean barbershop scent, lasts long and projects well. Perfect for office 4. Fraganote Not Just Mango: Super unique, the only Mango fragrance I've ever smelled. That being said, it can be polarizing, smells like a mango ice-cream bar. Lasts long and is only suited for parties where you want to be noticed and stand out for being different 5. Fraganote Pineapple Club: A good pineapple scent. Nothing like Creed Aventus or Hacivat, has its own DNA, and does stand out. Smells like freshly cut pineapple but the note is very subtle, and smells super fresh. Can be a good office scent All Fraganote fragrances lasted well and projected well. Again, I understand the financial decision of fragrance houses operating in this price range to stick to clones and smells you know will work, saving R&D costs and turning a profit at fraction of the original price. Extremely bold for Fraganote to create their own fragrances at 1200 per 50 ML price and experiment. Hope they keep doing this and bring unique scents to our noses"

mov_482C3222FBDE39861B5D01F7426918E1,2025-07-15 15:52:36,en,WEB,"  Rihanna, soon-to-be mother of three, hit the blue carpet at the Los Angeles premiere of Smurfs on Sunday (July 13), bringing her sons, RZA and Riot Rose, along for the moment — plus a very visible baby bump. With her sons at her side decked out in custom Dior, Rihanna made it clear that she's raising them with more than just style in mind by prioritizing real-world experiences over screen time. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, the Fenty mogul shut down the idea of raising kids who depend on a tablet for everything. “No tablet babies,” she said, adding that she wants her children to grow up outdoors, exploring the world with their own eyes, not glued to a device. Her reasoning, however, went deeper than just following parenting trends. Rihanna credited her late father, Ronald Fenty, for shaping how she approaches motherhood today. “I've always dreamed of what type of grandfather he would be to them,” she shared, reflecting on his influence. “He prepared me for having two boys, really. The adventurous side of me, the outside side of me, the daredevil — that's how I want to raise them.” [embedded content] Her father passed away in May 2025 at the age of 70, reportedly after battling an undisclosed illness. He was laid to rest in Barbados on July 8, with Rihanna and family in tow. While their relationship wasn't always picture-perfect, Rihanna reflected on the gratitude she had for her “barefoot” childhood, running “free and wild” – something she hopes to pass down to her kids. As for expanding the family, Rihanna and A$AP Rocky have made it clear that they're not done building their legacy. Rocky once joked about wanting a family dynasty like the Wayans, and Rihanna seems to be right there with him. “Love is beautiful and [growing his family is] just spreading it,” Rocky previously told theGrio. Fans have already been speculating whether the couple's third child will be a boy or a girl, but Rihanna is keeping at least one family tradition alive no matter what. “That's the one thing me and Rocky don't fight over,” she said with a laugh, confirming the next baby will join the “R” name club just like their siblings. Take a look above at Rihanna speaking on the gems her father bestowed upon her when it comes to parenting."

Love them or hate them, bucket hats are back, and the latest spike in sales (up 89 per cent in the last three months, according to Klarna) can be squarely attributed to Manchester's most famous and freshly reconciled brothers, the Gallaghers. Oasis have kicked off their Live '25 tour, and if dispatches from the Cardiff and Manchester shows are anything to go by, the London dates are set to be pure gold. Naturally, the Britpop poster boys' reunion has sparked a new clamour for all things Nineties fashion, from Harrington jackets to vintage football shirts. Searching for a way to buy into the scene without looking like an extra from Kevin & Perry Go Large? A bucket hat is the ultimate accessory. Originally designed for farmers and fishermen, the practical headwear made its way into pop culture via the hip-hop scene in the 80s and 90s, when the likes of LL Cool J and Run-DMC sported the look. It wasn't long before scores of bucket hats began popping up at British festivals, attendees no doubt drawn to their waterproof and sun-shading qualities - who doesn't have trust issues when it comes to summer weather? - plus their ability to mask greasy, unwashed hair and roll up tightly in a backpack without destroying the design. For those who were there the first time around, peak-Nineties Liam was the frontman snarling into a mic from under the brim of a bucket hat. Kangol was generally the brand of choice then, but luxe labels have since cottoned on with versions more boujee than budget. Dior, Burberry, Jacquemus and Louis Vuitton all offer bucket hats in their current collections, making the once-agricultural accessory fit for the A-list (with prices to match). Those without the requisite deep pockets will still strike gold on the high street - Nike, adidas, Urban Outfitters and more offer bucket hats at less Supersonic prices. If you're looking for a way to look and feel Nineties nostalgia, we've got the best options by the, ahem, bucket load. From high street to high end, find the best bucket hats to wear to Oasis or your next festival below. Shop now Adidas Originals Tour Bucket Hat Simple and in a foolproof black and white colourway, adidas' Oasis bucket hat nails the brief. There's only limited online stock, so if you want it to complete your gig outfit, you'd better be quick. Kangol Cotton Stripe Bucket Hat Make like LG in this light blue Kangol number, featuring a contrast stripe and matching brand motif. It's completely made from cotton and will need to be hand-washed to keep clean. Get it in small and large sizes. Stone Island Bucket hat with mesh lining and compass embroidery A functional name for a functional accessory, Stone Island keeps its bucket nice and streamlined. While it's available in black, navy and shades of green, this metallic silver will pop in pre-gig group photos. iets frans... Brown Check Bucket Hat For less than a tenner, there's no reason not to jump on the bucket hat bandwagon yourself. Available exclusively at Urban Outfitters, this checked design feels timeless and is on sale right now - it was: £24. Don't let it slide away. AllSaints Skye Bucket Hat Your new festival favourite, AllSaints washed denim look nails the Nineties brief. Pair with hoops and smudged eyeliner for an instant cool girl look. JiaTL WeyJia Women's Bucket Hat Crochet comes into its own in the summer, but the look isn't just for the beach. This option, crafted from four rolls of milk cotton yarn, is soft to the touch and breathable, making it perfect for when you're jumping around, sweaty and singing. It comes in a range of colourways, but we like the classic monochrome best. Coach Signature Jacquard Bucket Hat Want to make greener fashion choices? Head to Coach's outlet website, where you can pick up this cute bucket hat, made from 71 per cent recycled polyester and 29 per cent regenerative cotton. Available in two sizes. Jacquemus The Gadjo Bucket Hat Pay tribute to Kangol's OG baby blue design with this souped-up version, courtesy of Jacquemus. It comes in four colours and three sizes with a knotted detail on the reverse. CK Jeans Embroidered Monogram Bucket Hat CK One was one of the best-selling fragrances of the Nineties, with unisex appeal...."

mov_608827EDA4E37094B0F4EFB26018DAA1,2025-07-15 18:24:11,en,WEB,"  Italian cashmere house Loro Piana, famed for its ""quiet luxury "" brand under the LVMH empire, has been placed under court monitoring over alleged labor abuses in its supply chain involving unauthorized Chinese-run factories using illegal and underpaid workers. An investigation revealed that Loro Piana had allegedly subcontracted production to a shell company that further outsourced work to reduce costs. The shell company allegedly issued fake invoices and engaged in exploitative labor practices, Reuters reported, adding that the brand will now undergo court monitoring for one year as a result. The Milan court's ruling on Monday reportedly makes Loro Piana the fifth high-end brand in Italy to face judicial oversight in a widening crackdown on worker exploitation in the fashion industry. Fashion brands including Valentino, Armani, LVMH's second-largest brand Dior and Italian handbag company Alviero Martini were previously placed under administration for similar issues, Reuters added. HERMÈS OVERTAKES LVMH IN MARKET CAP TO BECOME MOST VALUABLE LUXURY COMPANY Without naming Loro Piana directly, Italy's paramilitary Carabinieri police said in a statement Monday that its labor protection unit had executed a ""judicial administration "" order against a company operating in the high-fashion sector. READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP ""It was determined that the fashion house outsources the production of clothing items (including cashmere jackets) to a company with no production capacity, which then outsources the production process to another company, which, in turn, outsources production to Chinese factories to reduce costs, "" the Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Labor said in a press release. The agency added that these factories slashed expenses by hiring undocumented workers, often under unsafe and unfair conditions — paying low wages, ignoring safety regulations and violating labor laws on working hours, breaks and time off. THE HERMES BIRKIN BAG ALLURE AND WHY THE PRICE TAG IS SO HIGH Loro Piana said Tuesday in a statement to FOX Business that a supplier subcontracted work without informing the company, breaching legal and contractual obligations. The company said it learned of the issue on May 20 and ""terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours."" ""Loro Piana acknowledges the notification received from the Court of Milan's Preventive Measure Section today regarding labor practices by undisclosed and unauthorized subcontractors of one of its suppliers, "" the company said. ""Loro Piana firmly condemns any illegal practices and reaffirms its unwavering commitment to upholding human rights and compliance with all applicable regulations throughout its supply chain, "" it added. ""Loro Piana is committed to ensuring that all its suppliers comply with the Maison's highest quality and ethical standards in line with its Code of Conduct. In this perspective, Loro Piana has been constantly reviewing and will continue to strengthen its control and audit activities."" FASHION NOVA SUED FOR COPYING JENNIFER LOPEZ'S ICONIC VERSACE DRESS The investigation into the luxury powerhouse began in May after a Chinese worker reported being physically assaulted by his employer after demanding roughly $11,700 in unpaid wages, according to Reuters. The employer allegedly beat the laborer and caused injuries that required 45 days of treatment. As a result, the Carabinieri police arrested the Chinese workshop owner and closed his factory in the northwestern suburbs of Milan, the outlet said. Carabinieri police found that the workshop produced Loro Piana-branded cashmere jackets and that its laborers were forced to work up to 90 hours a week, seven days a week, for roughly $4 an hour, Reuters reported. Police said the workers also slept in makeshift rooms illegally built inside the factory, the outlet added. Carabinieri police said inspections at several factories in the Milan area ultimately found 21 unidentified Chinese workers, 10 of whom were employed illegally and seven of whom were undocumented immigrants in Italy. Reuters contributed to this report. Original article source: LVMH's luxury label Loro Piana placed under court monitoring over alleged labor abuse, undocumented workers"

Before the AL and NL All-Stars got into uniform for Tuesday night's game, the players and their families arrived in style on the red carpet. Who was best-dressed and who missed the mark? Yahoo Sports breaks it all down below: Ronald Acuña Jr. is as reliable as they come on the All-Star red carpet. As the video below calls out, he's put together some incredible looks over the years, and this year was no different. As usual, the bling was blinding, with Acuña sporting a circular Atlanta-themed pendant he said he designed himself. I wasn't familiar with your game, Tarik Skubal. The AL starting pitcher brought high fashion to the carpet in an all-black look featuring Dior, Valentino and Jil Sander. The chains and sunglasses complete the cool, effortless vibe. Skubal may not have known what he was wearing, but whoever is dressing him, keep it up. We see you, Aaron Judge! The Yankees star naturally incorporated pinstripes into his look, rocking a sleek summer-vibe suit paired with leather boots in a combination that just works. His wife, Samantha, complements the look with her cream-colored peplum detail minidress. Continuing with the summer-white theme, Yoshinobu Yamamoto channeled Hollywood glam with this sharp, formal look. The details, from the tie accessory to the watch, are on point. Yankees star Jazz Chisholm Jr. always shows out, and this year was no different as he sported a very on-trend belted suit jacket, plus a set of brooches. The flower chains on his pants and wrist add a touch of fun to the look. Also on the brooch train was Max Fried, whose textured jacket, baggy pants and sneakers struck the right effortlessly chic tone. Fernando Tatis Jr. is always willing to take a fashion risk, and it paid off with this white jacket, flared pants and black boot combo. The no-shirt look, complete with the necklace, just works. What's in Pete Alonso's bag? He didn't say, but the Fauré Le Page tote was a chic accessory, and the slugger wins points for knowing his fashion history. The All-Star red carpet brings MLB families together, and we have to acknowledge the Lindors, whose looks complement each other well without being too matchy. Francisco Lindor's detailed jacket paired with laid-back jeans makes for a cool-casual look. Edwin Díaz and his family showed out in matching green suits, and you just have to appreciate the commitment to the uniform. Not only did the Marte family coordinate, but their sleeveless blue, belted suits are top-tier. We do have questions about D. Baxter the Bobcat's look, however. Shohei Ohtani has had some top-tier fashion moments in the past, highlighted by his forest-green suit at the 2022 All-Star Game. But even the best player in the game will swing and miss, and that's what happened at this year's red carpet. Ohtani's look on Tuesday was ill-fitting and disjointed, but his wife, Mamiko, picked up the slack in a very apropos peach-colored dress. Clayton Kershaw notched his 3,003rd career strikeout last week, but unfortunately for him, he struck out on the red carpet with this dull, mismatched look. We're not sure sleeveless is the way to go, but a little risk-taking couldn't hurt. Despite being near the bottom, Paul Skenes does win some points for wearing a local Pittsburgh designer, David Allen, and for his funny retort to girlfriend Livvy Dunne's comment about his fashion. But his mauve suit with the robin-egg blue accents misses the mark a bit. Cal Raleigh is on top of the baseball world right now after his Home Run Derby win on Monday night, so we won't bring him down too much, but his navy suit just leaves a bit to be desired. We give Raleigh props for owning his ""dad swag,"" though. Kudos to the Rodón family for their coordination, but Carlos Rodón's suit is ... a lot. We're not sure who Mr. and Mrs. Met are wearing, but let's step it up next year, guys."

Yankees star Jazz Chisholm Jr. always shows out, and this year was no different as he sported a very on-trend belted suit jacket, plus a set of brooches. The flower chains on his pants and wrist add a touch of fun to the look. Also on the brooch train was Max Fried, whose textured jacket, baggy pants and sneakers struck the right effortlessly chic tone. Fernando Tatis Jr. is always willing to take a fashion risk, and it paid off with this white jacket, flared pants and black boot combo. The no-shirt look, complete with the necklace, just works.

Edwin Díaz and his family showed out in matching green suits, and you just have to appreciate the commitment to the uniform. Not only did the Marte family coordinate, but their sleeveless blue, belted suits are top-tier. We do have questions about D. Baxter the Bobcat's look, however. Losers Shohei Ohtani has had some top-tier fashion moments in the past, highlighted by his forest-green suit at the 2022 All-Star Game. But even the best player in the game will swing and miss, and that's what happened at this year's red carpet. Ohtani's look on Tuesday was ill-fitting and disjointed, but his wife, Mamiko, picked up the slack in a very apropos peach-colored dress. Clayton Kershaw notched his 3,003rd career strikeout last week, but unfortunately for him, he struck out on the red carpet with this dull, mismatched look. We're not sure sleeveless is the way to go, but a little risk-taking couldn't hurt. Despite being near the bottom, Paul Skenes does win some points for wearing a local Pittsburgh designer, David Allen, and for his funny retort to girlfriend Livvy Dunne's comment about his fashion. But his mauve suit with the robin-egg blue accents misses the mark a bit. Cal Raleigh is on top of the baseball world right now after his Home Run Derby win on Monday night, so we won't bring him down too much, but his navy suit just leaves a bit to be desired. We give Raleigh props for owning his ""dad swag,"" though. Kudos to the Rodón family for their coordination, but Carlos Rodón's suit is ... a lot. We're not sure who Mr. and Mrs. Met are wearing, but let's step it up next year, guys."
mov_963DAC36AF2D29C9E70EAFBDDB3323B2,2025-07-15 21:50:53,en,WEB,"  The 2025 MLB All-Star festivities are upon us, with the sport's biggest stars descending on Atlanta this week. Before the AL and NL All-Stars got into uniform for Tuesday night's game, the players and their families arrived in style on the red carpet. Who was best-dressed and who missed the mark? Yahoo Sports breaks it all down below: Winners Ronald Acuña Jr. is as reliable as they come on the All-Star red carpet. As the video below calls out, he's put together some incredible looks over the years, and this year was no different. As usual, the bling was blinding, with Acuña sporting a circular Atlanta-themed pendant he said he designed himself. I wasn't familiar with your game, Tarik Skubal. The AL starting pitcher brought high fashion to the carpet in an all-black look featuring Dior, Valentino and Jil Sander. The chains and sunglasses complete the cool, effortless vibe. Skubal may not have known what he was wearing, but whoever is dressing him, keep it up. We see you, Aaron Judge! The Yankees star naturally incorporated pinstripes into his look, rocking a sleek summer-vibe suit paired with leather boots in a combination that just works. His wife, Samantha, complements the look with her cream-colored peplum detail minidress. Continuing with the summer-white theme, Yoshinobu Yamamoto channeled Hollywood glam with this sharp, formal look. The details, from the tie accessory to the watch, are on point. Yankees star Jazz Chisholm Jr. always shows out, and this year was no different as he sported a very on-trend belted suit jacket, plus a set of brooches.

mov_6503044E6C33A56991A287559E4A9065,2025-07-15 23:26:14,en,WEB,"  Summary LVMH-owned Loro Piana has been placed under court administration for a year after a worker was beaten at a subcontracted workshop for demanding unpaid wages, revealing severe labor exploitation, including undocumented workers paid €4/hr, forced to endure 90-hour weeks. This incident highlights broader issues of worker abuse in the luxury apparel industry, with Loro Piana being one of several brands, including Armani, Dior, and Valentino, recently scrutinized by a Milan court for labor violations despite Europe's push for ethical production. As confirmed in multiple reports, LVMH-owned label Loro Piana is the latest European fashion house to be placed under court administration for a year, following the revelation of the brutal beating of a worker who demanded unpaid wages from a subcontracted workshop. The incident, which happened at a subcontracted jacket workshop Northwest of Milan, led to the arrest of the facility's Chinese owner and its immediate closure by the Carabinieri police department. According to Business of Fashion, the Carabinieri police found that the facility, which produced Loro Piana cashmere garments, employed 10 Chinese migrant workers, 5 of whom were undocumented. Forced to work as much as 90 hours a week, all 7 days, the laborers were only paid €4 an hour, and housed in illegal dwellings inside the factory. The Carabinieri police investigated two intermediary companies and three Chinese workshops located in Milan, finding that half of the workers were working without registration. In an official statement, Loro Piana disclosed that it “acknowledges the notification received from the Court of Milan's Preventive Measure Section today regarding labor practices by undisclosed and unauthorized subcontractors of one of its suppliers.” The brand alleges that its supplier did not inform Loro Piana of its subcontractors and their labor violations, and “terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours,” after being notified on May 20. “Loro Piana firmly condemns any illegal practices and reaffirms its unwavering commitment to upholding human rights and compliance with all applicable regulations throughout its supply chain,” the statement said. The latest news comes as part of intensifying efforts to hold luxury brands responsible for labor exploitation, a crime that's not unique to Loro Piana's supply chain but symptomatic of a globalized system of worker abuses across the apparel industry. However, the Italian cashmere purveyor is only one of five luxury labels that have also been placed under recent administration by the same Milan court for labor concerns and violations. Armani, Dior, and Valentino are some of the other notable brands that had their restrictions lifted in the last year, following steps to correct abuses. Among the most jarring details is often the disparity between how much garment workers make versus the final price tag, which for Loro Piana reaches more $5,000 for a cashmere jacket. According to the court ruling, one intermediary owner stated that she produced approximately 6,000-7,000 jackets per year for Loro Piana at €118 per jacket if the order was for more than 100 items, and €128 if the order was under 100 items. Though the disparity is not uncommon for a luxury brand, Loro Piana was already under particular scrutiny regarding the treatment of indigenous and immigrant workers. In 2024, it was revealed that an Indigenous Andean village reliant on Loro Piana's business gets paid roughly $280 for the same amount of Vicuna wool needed for garments priced as much as $9,000 USD. Bloomberg's 2024 report spotlighted Vicuna herder Andrea Barrientos in the Andean community of Lucanas, who shared that she and others receive none of the pay disbursed to their community. The woman had never seen a finished Loro Piana garment in her life, despite cultivating the highly sought-after camelid wool for a living. The most recent scandals reveal that sweatshop-like conditions are not isolated to the Global South and are very much alive in Europe. Though many of these cases involve European fashion conglomerates like LVMH, European governments are on the contrary, are pushing some of the most aggressive efforts to promote ethical production. In June, France's Senate voted in favor of an unprecedented bill aimed at regulating fast fashion companies — a major development in efforts to mitigate the ecological impact of overconsumption. However, some critics pointed out that the measures focused on targeting Asian companies like Temu and Shein, while granting less severe regulations to European companies. Despite luxury brands' increasingly high margins and prices, many of their most crucial artisans and suppliers continue to be left with little to nothing. Europe's intensified measures to protect workers from labor abuses and mitigate the environmental impact of the fashion industry are paving the way for a more responsible system rooted in accountability. While many customers may never see the people who do the grueling work involved in creating luxuries, the influx of recent cases from the world's most respected purveyors is a sobering reminder of the injustices endured by the people and communities behind the product.

La misura è stata richiesta dal Pm Paolo Storari sulla base dell'art. 34 del codice antimafia: l'imputazione è quella di sfruttamento del lavoro, in quanto Loro Piana “non avrebbe messo in atto misure idonee alla verifica delle reali condizioni di lavoro delle aziende appaltatrici”. Un'accusa simile era già stata rivolta da Storari contro Armani, Dior, Valentino Bags Lab, Dhl, Carrefour, Esselunga, Gls, Uber, Sicuritalia, Lidl, Amazon, Fed Ex e altre aziende. La tesi di fondo è che l'imprenditore era tenuto a verificare le condizioni di lavoro presso appaltatori e subappaltatori (!). Ma la responsabilità penale non era personale? Con questi chiari di luna si capisce perché non ci sia la fila degli imprenditori stranieri per investire in Italia."

INDEX SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025 SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025 SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025 July 09: CyCraft Technology Co Ltd: Rockerbox Data Breach Exposes Sensitive Information Of Millions A recent report by VPNMentor has uncovered a significant data breach involving Rockerbox, a US-based marketing analytics platform, exposing sensitive personal details of approximately 272 million individuals. The breach originated from an unsecured Amazon Web Services (AWS) S3 bucket, which was left accessible without password protection. The exposed dataset, comprising over 1.2 terabytes of data and an estimated 8.7 billion records, included personal and behavioural information collected for clients, including T-Mobile. This incident demonstrates the growing risks of misconfigured cloud storage in an increasingly data-driven world. Scope Of The Breach The unsecured AWS S3 bucket contained a vast trove of data, including full names, email addresses, phone numbers, postal addresses, and purchase histories. Beyond personal identifiers, the dataset included detailed behavioural data, such as browsing histories, IP addresses, and device information, used by Rockerbox to build targeted marketing profiles. Some records also contained partial credit card details and transaction amounts, heightening the risk of financial fraud and identity theft. The report notes that the sheer volume of data - spanning billions of records - makes this one of the largest breaches of its kind, with the potential to affect millions of users across multiple industries.

Motivul este să fi „depășit” exploatarea lucrătorilor, în mare parte chinezi, angajați în condiții considerate nevrednice. Este ultima serie lungă de cercetări privind practicile de muncă în lanțul de subcontractări ale industriei de lux din Italia, și, cu siguranță, nu e singura țară unde se petrece acest lucru… Conform anchetei Parchetului local, sub conducerea procurorului Paolo Storai, Loro Piana ar fi delegat producția hainelor sale sub-contractanților, care la rândul lor au fost implicați într-o cascadă de subcontractări, inclusiv ateliere clandestine conduse de cetățeni chinezi. Aceștia din urmă și, direct, angajații lor, erau cei mai exploatați și primeau cele mai mici salarii Judecătorii vorbesc despre un „sistem organizat pentru a reduce costurile și a maximiza beneficiile”, construit în detrimentul lucrătorilor precare și de ceea ce in anchetă au numit „supraexploatare”, ceea ce nu este o noutate, chiar și în alte mărci comerciale ale LVMH, precum Valentino, Dior, Armani și Alviero Martini, care au fost, de asemenea, supuse proceselor în ultimele luni. Loro Piana a externalizat fabricarea Evergreen Fashion Group, o companie fără unități de producție, care la rândul lor i-a oferit lui Sor-Man, subcontractantul a două ateliere gestionate de Clover Fashion (Baranzate) și Dai Meiying (Senago). Aceste companii de fațadă au folosit lucrătorii chinezi „la negru”, obligați să lucreze până la 13 ore pe zi, fără odihnă, în dormitoare insalubre, fără echipamente de securitate sau supraveghere medicală. Deși nu a fost urmărită penal, Loro Piana este acuzată că și-a încălcat datoria de supraveghere cu privire la ceea ce fac subcontractanții ei. Instanța a denunțat o „lipsă generală de modele organizaționale”, audituri interne „pur formale” și incapacitate de a supraveghea lanțul de producție, în ciuda avertismentelor și precedentelor industriei de lux. Judecătorii consideră că aceste deficiențe „favorizează structural” exploatarea, permițând perpetuarea sistemului. Astfel, hainele din Kașmir au fost fabricate la un preț aproximativ de o sută de euro fiecare, fiind ulterior vândute în Europa la preturi de zece ori mai mari. Administrația judiciară impusă lui Loro Piana este o măsură neobișnuită, dar simbolică. Timp de un an, conducerea companiei va participa la un audit direct, pentru a elimina practicile, a examina subcontractările și a garanta îndeplinirea legislației muncii. Compania Holding LVMH a menținut până acum un profil discret.Ca și alte companii din industria de lux, acestea sunt conduse de o adunătură de escroci. Nu vând bunuri, ci mărci. Cu o cifră de afaceri anuală de 1,3 miliarde de euro și mai mult de 2.300 de lucrători, Loro Piana este una dintre „bijuteriile coroanei” unei companii holding, bazate pe supraexploatarea celor mai sărace țări din lume, unde angajații locali nu au niciun fel de drepturi. Acțiunea instanței italiene este un mic pas simbolic, care, poate, cu timpul va ajunge să schimbe ceva. A consemnat Ciprian Pop Continue Reading"

There are so many different ethnicities, religions, and cultures living in complete harmony. I think that talent diversity is wonderful! The calibre of talent here is a tremendous advantage, too. Singapore has got some of the best universities in the world. And I find Singaporeans are generally ready and willing to move out of Singapore and have international careers. The country also has brilliant infrastructure, connectivity, a strong digital roadmap, a focus on innovation. These factors make it very attractive for talent to be here. Location-wise, Singapore is the gateway to Southeast Asia and Oceania. This region is a very important growth engine for LVMH. Most of LVMH's brands - like Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Sephora, Bulgari, Tiffany & Co. - have also established regional headquarters in Singapore. So, from all angles, it just makes sense for us to establish a talent hub for the region, in Singapore.

In 2024, LVMH launched the SPRING Future Leaders Program in Singapore, its first edition outside of France. It is a fast-track development programme for talented graduates. Successful candidates will be exposed to a diversity of business functions across Maisons, supported by a bespoke 30-month development plan. We sat down with Avi Chua, 25, to hear about her experience as one of the pioneer candidates of the SPRING programme here. Avi has recently completed her first rotation as a merchandiser at CELINE Southeast Asia and Oceania, and has moved to Tiffany & Co. as an e-commerce project manager. She holds a bachelor's degree in business management from the Singapore Management University.

He used his SkillsFuture Credit to get a diploma in web and programming and is currently pursuing a Master of Public Health at the National University of Singapore. 1. What is your role exactly and can you describe what a regular day at work is like? At Novo Nordisk, I look at how we can create new business streams and drive customer engagement through the digital healthcare solutions we are developing. Over the years, my role has expanded beyond Singapore as well - I currently oversee our business in Brunei as part of my portfolio. To be honest, no two days are the same at Novo Nordisk. My job is to connect the dots between different teams and stakeholders to ensure the smooth completion of projects. Given that digitalisation in healthcare is still an evolving field, I sometimes have to bring in ""new dots"" - new people from both within and outside the company - to facilitate this. The challenge we often face is how to effectively communicate the value of our work to the stakeholders involved - from the healthcare practitioners who are using our solutions, to the internal technical team that has to read beyond the lines of code to understand the eventual impact they're creating for doctors and patients. I prefer a more hands-on approach where I familiarise myself with the project technology stacks we use and speak with doctors to better understand their needs.

The alliance, called The Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets, was launched on 24 June at the London Climate Action Week. While the three countries are the pioneering members of the alliance, other nations are invited to join and grow the coalition, which hopes to raise the standards of the unregulated voluntary carbon market globally. On 24 June, Panama and France became the latest members, and Peru endorsed the coalition. By growing the demand for high-integrity credits, the carbon market could expand to as much as US$250 billion (S$320.5 billion) by 2050. This can support sustainable development, agriculture, clean energy and nature conservation, and restoration.

Luckily for us, it's kickstarting the new era with a bang — and we're all invited to celebrate. This August, the beloved high street retailer will return to the catwalk for the first time in seven years, staging a blockbuster fashion show in London to reveal its AW25 collection. For now, the location is top secret, but Topshop said it would be a 'landmark' setting in the capital. The show will be followed by a street party, complete with live music, DJ sets and surprise guests from the London creative community. Both events will be open to the public, the brand said. The looks from the show will be available to purchase on the newly re-launched Topshop.com website. Fans can expect to shop fashion-forward takes on new season outerwear, tailoring and denim pieces from both Topshop and Topman, along with a sneak preview of more looks set to drop later in the year. As the first high street brand to stage catwalk shows during London Fashion Week, Topshop was a pioneer of bridging the gap between high fashion and the British high street. The brand first partnered with the British Fashion Council in 2003 to sponsor its NEWGEN talent programme — which counts Simone Rocha, Christopher Kane, Erdem, and Dior creative director Jonathan Anderson among its alumni — before joining the official schedule with a catwalk show in 2005. In its heyday, its fashion shows were staple events on the London Fashion Week calendar, with names like Adowa Aboah and Jourdan Dunn gracing the runway, as celebrities like Kate Moss, Alexa Chung, Kendall Jenner and Lily Allen sat front row. In line with Topshop's roots of discovering and championing next generation talent, the brand is hosting an open casting to recruit models for the show, in collaboration with Wilhelmina Models, with applications open until August 4.

n3fvst4,2025-07-16 13:11:21,en,REDDIT,"  My apologies, I didn't mean to sound like I was saying you were incorrect. Yes, I understand they have different couriers and a different policy regarding deliveries of dangerous goods. I can't buy any fragrance directly from Amazon because of it; they literally will not send fragrance to my city, but third party sellers on Amazon can. My comment about the returns is regarding opened packages, as in America (and I think in the UK/EU too) you can return a fragrance if you don't like it even after you've opened it. You can't return an opened fragrance here even if you take it directly to the store yourself. As I said, I've returned unopened fragrances when I was sent the wrong thing and that was through Australia Post. Chemist Warehouse lists the no return policy on fragrances as being for hygiene and safety reasons. They sent me the wrong thing and I had to argue with them over it when they had the pre 2020 Dior Homme listed along with the pre 2020 notes and images, but sent me Dior Homme 2020 and said it was simply new packaging. I had to explain how it was a completely different fragrance and after several emails back and forth they eventually allowed me to return it. They've now updated the listing on their website."
mov_7A6B774CF7656A8E8EB4350CFCCF7316,2025-07-16 13:11:45,en,WEB,"  There has been a notable movement at the top half of that list The Bloomberg Billionaires Index which is a real-time daily ranking of the world's wealthiest individuals has just updated its list as of July 16, 2025. There has been a notable movement at the top half of that list. While Elon Musk remains on top, there's an interesting shift at the No. 2 position. As of now, Oracle's Larry Elison is marginally ahead of Meta's Mark Zuckerberg who is at the third spot. Tesla Rockets, Social Media platform X, SpaceX rockets, Neuralink implants make Elon Musk to be the most talked-about man in tech and he also remains at the top of the global wealth pyramid. Although, there has been a slight dip in his net wealth this year, but his dominance in AI, space, and EVs keeps him at the numero position. The Oracle founder and chairman, riding high on enterprise software and AI investments, has reached the second spot. Oracle's strong cloud growth and strategic partnerships have kept Ellison in the billionaire big league. This also proves that old tech still has new tricks. This can be seen as a slight dip in the Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wealth as he is currently at the third spot in the list. Despite that, he is enjoying a surge in wealth as the company doubles down on AI and VR and Zuckerberg is no longer just a social media mogul. Unarguably, he's now a central player in shaping the virtual future for the world. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos may have stepped back from day-to-day operations, but his net worth keeps soaring. His strategy has been centred around strategic stock buybacks. Moreover, successful ventures like Blue Origin, and a resilient e-commerce backbone has made Bezos a perennial fixture in the global wealth top tier. The LA Clippers owner and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer has the reputation of quietly building one of the largest tech fortunes in the world. Ballmer's net worth keeps climbing because of Microsoft's continued dominance in AI and enterprise software. The Google co-founder Larry Page continues to reap the rewards of Alphabet's sustained strength. Google Search, cloud computing, and autonomous vehicle ventures are the main drivers behind his wealth. Though he stays largely out of the spotlight, but his wealth keeps shining brightly. The chairman of LVMH is the only non-tech billionaire in the top 10. Despite a volatile year for the luxury sector, Arnault remains the king of couture, commanding brands like Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Tiffany & Co. Alphabet's other co-founder stays close to Larry Page in net worth. Brin's investments in AI, biotech, and climate tech continue to pay off, even as he maintains a lower public profile than many of his peers. The AI chip boom has helped the Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang in maintaining his position in this elite club. As demand for GPUs and AI infrastructure surges globally, Huang has rapidly climbed the billionaire ranks. His rise from a boardroom engineer to tech's newest superstar definitely inspires many. At 94, the 'Oracle of Omaha' Warren Buffett still holds a commanding spot in the top 10. Buffett's disciplined value investing through Berkshire Hathaway has stood the test of time. He has successfully countered the tech trends while staying firmly rooted in fundamentals."

The Project Runway host welcomed Leni in May 2004 in N.Y.C. Heidi and Leni's biological father, Italian businessman Flavio Briatore, split before the birth. As Leni entered adulthood, she followed in her mom's footsteps and pursued a modeling career, making her professional debut alongside Heidi for the January/February 2021 issue of Vogue Germany. To celebrate the milestone, Heidi shared her excitement with a sweet message on , beginning by writing, ""I'm so proud of you."" ""I know, that no matter which path you were to go down, you would be your own woman. You always know exactly what you want and what you don't want,"" ,"" she captioned the December 2020 post, which was translated from German. ""You ain't no mini-me and I'm happy for you that you can now show who YOU are."" In honor of Leni's 21st birthday in May 2025, Heidi shared another heartfelt note to her daughter on , writing, ""From the moment you stepped into the world's view, you've shined in everything you do."" She continued, ""You remind us that true beauty is found in being real, staying kind, and walking your own path with confidence. ."" Here's everything to know about Heidi Klum's daughter, Leni Olumi Klum. She was born in N.Y.C. Taylor Hill/Getty Leni Olumi Klum attends the 2025 King's Trust Global Gala on May 1, 2025, in New York City. Leni Olumi Klum was born on May 4, 2004, in N.Y.C., shortly after Heidi split from Briatore. She was 5 years old when she was adopted by Heidi's then-husband, Seal, in December 2009. More in Celebrity “They have both taught me to be myself, and to do what makes me feel comfortable,” Leni told PEOPLE of Heidi and Seal. “You can tell if you're not comfortable and then the best of you isn't brought out. I just think you should be open and honest with what makes you comfortable, be yourself, do what you love. And if you do all those three things then you're golden.” Leni grew up primarily in Los Angeles, where she from Pacifica Christian High School in 2022. She is a big sister to Heidi and Seal's three children together, sons Henry Günther and Johan Riley, and daughter Lou Sulola. Heidi and Seal separated in 2012, and the German-American model married Tokio Hotel guitarist Tom Kaulitz in 2019. In her December 2020 Instagram post, Heidi admitted that Leni “never had the possibility to grow up 'normal.' ” ""But what is normal? Growing up with three different daddies ... And I would say: none of it harmed you,” the proud mom wrote. “On the contrary: you are a self-possessed young woman, works hard for your goals. And even more important ... you are a really cool person, with your heart in the right place.” She was kept out of the public eye while growing up Daniele Venturelli/Daniele Venturelli/Getty Leni Klum and Heidi Klum attend the LuisaViaRoma for Unicef event at La Certosa di San Giacomo on July 31, 2021 in Capri, Italy. Leni has wanted to model since she was nearly 12 years old, and she told Vogue Germany that it was “only a matter of time” before she started pursuing it. ""The first offer came when I was only 12 or 13, from a brand I liked to wear: Brandy Melville. At that time I begged my mother, but no chance. Now I understand that it would have been too early,"" she said. Despite the many offers sent Leni's way, Heidi purposefully made an effort to ensure her daughter's privacy as she was growing up. “She's old enough now,” Klum told PEOPLE in 2020. “I always thought she was too young. We always also decided to keep the children out of the public eye.

NEED TO KNOW Leni Klum is the eldest of Heidi Klum's four children She was born in May 2004 in New York City Like her mom, Leni has pursued a modeling career Heidi Klum's eldest child, daughter Leni Olumi Klum, takes after her mom in many ways. The Project Runway host welcomed Leni in May 2004 in N.Y.C. Heidi and Leni's biological father, Italian businessman Flavio Briatore, split before the birth. As Leni entered adulthood, she followed in her mom's footsteps and pursued a modeling career, making her professional debut alongside Heidi for the January/February 2021 issue of Vogue Germany. To celebrate the milestone, Heidi shared her excitement with a sweet message on Instagram, beginning by writing, ""I'm so proud of you."" ""I know, that no matter which path you were to go down, you would be your own woman. You always know exactly what you want and what you don't want,"" ,"" she captioned the December 2020 post, which was translated from German. ""You ain't no mini-me and I'm happy for you that you can now show who YOU are."" In honor of Leni's 21st birthday in May 2025, Heidi shared another heartfelt note to her daughter on Instagram, writing, ""From the moment you stepped into the world's view, you've shined in everything you do."" She continued, ""You remind us that true beauty is found in being real, staying kind, and walking your own path with confidence. ð«¶ð»."" Here's everything to know about Heidi Klum's daughter, Leni Olumi Klum. She was born in N.Y.C. Taylor Hill/Getty Leni Olumi Klum attends the 2025 King's Trust Global Gala on May 1, 2025, in New York City. Leni Olumi Klum was born on May 4, 2004, in N.Y.C., shortly after Heidi split from Briatore. She was 5 years old when she was adopted by Heidi's then-husband, Seal, in December 2009. “They have both taught me to be myself, and to do what makes me feel comfortable,” Leni told PEOPLE of Heidi and Seal. “You can tell if you're not comfortable and then the best of you isn't brought out. I just think you should be open and honest with what makes you comfortable, be yourself, do what you love. And if you do all those three things then you're golden.” Leni grew up primarily in Los Angeles, where she graduated from Pacifica Christian High School in 2022. She is a big sister to Heidi and Seal's three children together, sons Henry Günther and Johan Riley, and daughter Lou Sulola. Heidi and Seal separated in 2012, and the German-American model married Tokio Hotel guitarist Tom Kaulitz in 2019. In her December 2020 Instagram post, Heidi admitted that Leni “never had the possibility to grow up 'normal.' ” ""But what is normal? Growing up with three different daddies ... And I would say: none of it harmed you,” the proud mom wrote. “On the contrary: you are a self-possessed young woman, works hard for your goals. And even more important ... you are a really cool person, with your heart in the right place.” She was kept out of the public eye while growing up Daniele Venturelli/Daniele Venturelli/Getty Leni Klum and Heidi Klum attend the LuisaViaRoma for Unicef event at La Certosa di San Giacomo on July 31, 2021 in Capri, Italy. Leni has wanted to model since she was nearly 12 years old, and she told Vogue Germany that it was “only a matter of time” before she started pursuing it. ""The first offer came when I was only 12 or 13, from a brand I liked to wear: Brandy Melville. At that time I begged my mother, but no chance. Now I understand that it would have been too early,"" she said. Despite the many offers sent Leni's way, Heidi purposefully made an effort to ensure her daughter's privacy as she was growing up. “She's old enough now,” Klum told PEOPLE in 2020. “I always thought she was too young. We always also decided to keep the children out of the public eye. But she's driving a car now, she's 16, so I figured if you can do that, you can also model now if this is what you wish to do.” ""Obviously, as a mother, [I want my] child to do what she wants to do,” she added...."

mov_026238D1CEF98B988283228A8C45E488,2025-07-16 17:49:27,en,WEB,"  An Italian court has placed the renowned luxury cashmere brand Loro Piana under judicial administration for a year after an investigation uncovered worker abuse and exploitation in its supply chain. The Court of Milan found that the company “culpably failed” to oversee its suppliers in order to pursue higher profits and cited a wider, systemic pattern of employing subcontractors that violate fair labor practices. Loro Piana is the fifth luxury brand – and the second LVMH-owned brand after Dior – to be found in violation of Italian labor laws since the country began cracking down on subcontracting practices commonly used throughout the industry. Other brands that the court determined have allowed illegal and unethical labor conditions to persist throughout their supply chain include Giorgio Armani, Valentino and handbag company Alviero Martini. This is not just a stain on the reputations of the brands involved but a threat to the entire luxury industry. Bain estimates that about 50% of global luxury goods production is carried out by thousands of small manufacturers in Italy. “Allegations of worker abuse can have a profoundly negative impact on the reputation of a high-end fashion brand,” said Stephen Hahn, chief reputation and strategy officer at RepTrak, a corporate reputation management firm. “Perceptions of workplace is one of the seven key drivers of reputation within the consumer discretionary industry and is especially important to luxury goods,” he continued. Allegations Of Mistreatment The investigation carried out by the Carabinieri police labor protection unit began in May after a worker reported being physically assaulted by his employer, a workshop – more accurately described as a “sweatshop” – that produced Loro Piana men's jackets. The company has since been shut down. Investigators found workers were forced to work up to 90 hours a week, seven days a week and made less than $5 per hour. They also slept in the factory in illegally built rooms. Further investigation found ten workers were employed illegally, seven of whom were undocumented immigrants from China. Complicating the investigation was the fact that Loro Piana didn't contract directly with the offending company but went through two front companies that had no actual manufacturing capability. The front companies subcontracted to several different firms, all of which were rounded up in the investigation. Loro Piana, not parent company LVMH, issued a statement to Fox Business, clarifying that it had not been made aware of the subcontractor relationships. The company emphasized that under both legal and contractual obligations, the company should have been informed of the arrangements. “Loro Piana firmly condemns any illegal practices and reaffirms its unwavering commitment to upholding human rights and compliance with all applicable regulations throughout its supply chain,” the company stated. “Loro Piana is committed to ensuring that all its suppliers comply with the Maison's highest quality and ethical standards in line with its Code of Conduct. In this perspective, Loro Piana has been constantly reviewing and will continue to strengthen its control and audit activities.” However, it appears alleged unethical dealings have been going on for some time, even after many of Italy's fashion brands signed an accord to fight worker exploitation in May. The owner of the subcontractor said the company has been producing between 6,000 and 7,000 men's jackets per year at prices between €118 and €128 ($137 to $149) depending upon the number ordered. Loro Piana cashmere jackets sell for more than $4,000, though the company stated: “The reported cost figures are not representative of the amounts paid by Loro Piana to its supplier nor do they consider the full value of all the elements, including, among others, raw materials and fabrics.” Tangled Web Milan-based visiting international marketing professor at Università Cattolica, Alessandro Balossini Volpe, explained that the luxury fashion supply chain is an increasingly complex network involving multiple manufacturers, raw materials suppliers and numerous contractors and subcontractors, making it increasingly difficult to keep track of. Added to that, the fashion industry is highly volatile with a growing demand for speed in deliveries, constantly revolving collections and diversification of product offerings. “The luxury fashion manufacturing supply chain in Italy is notoriously fragmented,” he explained, with a majority of suppliers being family-run businesses with ten or fewer employees. “Over the last several years, they have been under constant pressure on prices and shrinking volumes, which has put many small players out of business. As a consequence, if a brand has an increasing turnover of suppliers, control over them gets increasingly difficult,” he said, adding “We have a situation of unprecedented complexity in the management of the supply chain.” Tip Of The Iceberg? Balossini Volpe believes that a majority of luxury businesses and brands follow responsible business practices and have been rigorously trying to manage their supply chains. However, “I am also convinced that more than a few players, including some big names, have been chasing profits at all costs, sometimes turning their eyes away from disreputable situations that they could have fixed or changed.” He suggested that the five luxury brands implicated in unethical supply chain practices are not isolated occurrences, but rather the tip of the iceberg in a deeper, systematic failure within the fashion industry. “All of the luxury fashion brands could fall under suspicion of collectively engaging in unethical and unsustainable business practices,” he warned. “It would mean questioning not only the tangible, intrinsic value of the products, but also their intangible value that includes their credibility and integrity,” he concluded.

From the opulence of Bollywood costume design to the stylish convergence of global icons, the day's news highlights the evolving landscape of style. **Bollywood's Extravagant Costumes: A Celebration of Heritage** One of the key narratives emerging from the day's fashion news centers on the artistry and expense behind Bollywood film costumes. The industry's dedication to creating visually stunning and historically accurate wardrobes was showcased, moving beyond mere fashion and delving into cultural preservation and cinematic storytelling. Film productions are increasingly investing heavily in costume design, recognizing its critical role in immersing audiences in the narrative and enhancing the overall cinematic experience. The article specifically highlighted some of the most iconic and expensive costumes in Bollywood history. The red bridal lehenga worn by Aishwarya Rai Bachchan in the film *Jodhaa Akbar* stands out as a significant example. The lehenga, a testament to India's rich textile heritage, has achieved global recognition, finding a permanent place in fashion history and recently being added to the Academy Museum's ""Colour in Motion"" exhibition. This underscores the growing recognition of Bollywood costumes as works of art and cultural artifacts, solidifying their place in fashion's legacy. This development demonstrates the growing importance of costume design and its recognition as a critical element of film success, while also promoting cultural heritage through the lens of fashion. **Celebrity Collaborations and Style Crossovers:** Another significant trend shaping the fashion news cycle on July 16th was the ongoing influence of celebrity endorsements and style crossovers. The convergence of global icons, in particular, drove significant attention, demonstrating how celebrities can influence trends on social media platforms. The announcement of a collaboration between Formula 1 legend Lewis Hamilton and BTS member Jimin sparked considerable excitement within their combined fanbases. Hamilton's subtle acknowledgement of Jimin wearing an outfit from his Dior menswear collection on Instagram Stories was enough to ignite the internet. The post, accompanied by a handshake emoji and the simple caption ""my @dior collection (sic),"" immediately sent waves of enthusiasm through both ARMY (BTS fans) and motorsport enthusiasts. This demonstrates the power of celebrity endorsements and the potential for individual style choices to influence and drive trends across different spheres of culture. This type of engagement illustrates how social media has become a critical platform for showcasing fashion and solidifying celebrity style, showcasing the significance of brand collaboration within the industry. **Fashion Journalism and Current Trends:** The day's fashion news was rounded out by the ongoing efforts of the fashion journalism landscape. A subscription-based newsletter, ""Fashion Statement,"" offered a curated overview of current trends, commentary, and solutions to wardrobe dilemmas. This newsletter showcases the need for journalists to compile information for their readers. The newsletter and fashion journalism, in general, provides context, insight, and analysis of the fashion industry, which assists its readers in navigating the complexities of the world of style. **Key Takeaways:** The fashion news of July 16, 2025, provides several key takeaways for fashion enthusiasts and industry observers alike. First and foremost, it highlights the significance of integrating cultural and historical contexts into fashion. The inclusion of the *Jodhaa Akbar* lehenga in the Academy Museum's exhibition underscores the importance of preserving heritage and celebrating the artistry of costume design. Secondly, the story reflects the increasing power of celebrity influence, highlighting the crucial role of collaborations and endorsements in shaping trends. The convergence of Lewis Hamilton and Jimin demonstrates how celebrity personalities and brands can be leveraged to reach wider audiences. This continues to grow the importance of social media as a means of communication and trendsetting within the fashion space. Finally, the news summarizes the ongoing evolution of fashion journalism in providing the consumer with reliable and easy-to-digest information to help make the trends more accessible for everyone. In conclusion, the fashion landscape on July 16th, 2025, presented a multifaceted view, demonstrating a strong appreciation for artistry, cultural heritage, and the ever-present influence of celebrity culture, all of which will continue to shape the industry for years to come.

Le propriétaire de la marque de luxe ? Antoine Arnault. Le tribunal de Milan va alors découvrir l'horreur que vivent les travailleurs sans-papiers de Loro Piana. Afin de pouvoir réduire les coûts au maximum, les ouvriers étaient payés au noir et logés dans des dortoirs insalubres. La loi italienne était violée en permanence sur les salaires, les pauses, les horaires de travail et les vacances. Face à ces révélations, la justice italienne a placé Loro Piana sous administration judiciaire et suspendu deux ateliers. Des amendes et sanctions administratives ont été infligées à hauteur de 241 000 euros. C'est 0,0001586 % de la fortune de Bernard Arnault, située à 152 milliards d'euros. Il devrait s'en sortir. Loro Piana assure n'avoir jamais été au courant de ces maltraitances, alors que Cash Investigation les avait déjà épinglés en 2014. Ils n'ont rien appris depuis, puisqu'aucun contrôle n'a été réalisé par l'entreprise chez le sous-traitant ! Un manque de contrôle d'autant plus absurde que des scandales ont éclaté ailleurs depuis. En 2024, les sièges de Dior (également propriété de LVMH) et Giorgio Armani ont été perquisitionnés en Italie. Les chefs d'accusation sont les mêmes : horaires de travail insoutenables, conditions de santé et de sécurité inacceptables. Les deux entreprises sont accusées d'avoir publié des communiqués mensongers sur les conditions de travail de leurs sous-traitants. Bernard Arnault est un tyran qui, avec ses fils, exploite des ouvriers sans-papiers pour vendre des vêtements atrocement laids et chers. C'est un destructeur d'emplois qui délocalise ses sites de production alors que les grands groupes ont détruit 245 000 emplois en 10 ans. C'est une pince qui ne paie pas ses impôts et menace de quitter la France quand on veut taxer les riches. Au lieu de faire travailler les Français deux jours de plus, c'est à lui de payer. — avec Alma Dufour."

The night before three of the top cast members, whose characters are in a love triangle on the weepy teen saga, talked to The Tonight Show about which one will end up with beauty Isabel 'Belly' Conklin. The stars of the hit show are Lola Tung (as Belly), Gavin Casalegno (who plays Jeremiah) and Christopher Briney (who stars as brooding hunk Conrad). 'Season 2 ended with a major cliffhanger. This was a big deal. I mean, your character, Belly, chose Jeremiah over Conrad,' Jimmy Fallon said  before asking Tung what she thought about that ending. 'I'm all for her following her heart,' the actress shared as she said she was 'Team Belly.' Belly was careful to not give any secretive plot details away. She continued: 'And she's doing what she needs to do in the moment, and following her heart in that moment and in every moment.' In a snippet shared during the show, viewers see Belly watching Jeremiah play Twister when Conrad calls him. Jeremiah asks Belly to answer and she and Conrad have an awkward exchange. When asked about Season 3, Tung said, 'I think it's a lot more of the emotional rollercoaster you're used to, I guess, and also, you know, there's a little time jump, so we meet the characters in a little bit of a more mature place, I think.' Season three takes place four years after season two ended. While on The Tonight Show Tung wore a John Galliano for Dior corset dress from a 2001 collection, along with a pair of 2013 Dior Mary Jane pumps as she accessorized with Panconesi earrings. In a trailer for the show's third and final season, Conrad is seen asking Belly's best friend Taylor (played by Rain Spencer) for advice about his plan to come back into Belly's life. It's clear he is ready to win her over again. The first two episodes of season 3 of The Summer I Turned Pretty will premiere on Prime Video on Wednesday, July 16. Season three will consist of 10 episodes. The program, which had viewers crying hard enough to give themselves migraines, has become one of Amazon Prime Video's most popular shows. Amazon and MGM Studios' head of television, Vernon Sanders, issued a statement to elaborate on the success of the coming-of-age series. 'We've been delighted to see the passion with which fans have embraced The Summer I Turned Pretty, making Summer Fridays an entertainment phenomenon,' he said. Sanders went on to speak about how The Summer I Turned Pretty, which was created by Jenny Han, had quickly become a fan-favorite program. 'This charming, deeply heartfelt series has shown the breadth of our customer base, appealing to a young, diverse set of viewers. Jenny Han is a gifted storyteller, whose fans have been clamoring for the third chapter of this story,' he stated. The Summer I Turned Pretty is based on Han's book of the same name, which was originally released in 2009. The book was followed up by a pair of sequels that were published in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The series is centered on Isabel 'Belly' Conklin, a teenage girl who ends up in a love triangle with a pair of brothers."

44DF2738300840B12C56DCAB4CD23D30,2025-07-17 07:21:55,en,PRINT,"  Appearances at Wimbledon and a French state visit symbolize a new kind of style. Earlier this year, when Catherine, the Princess of Wales, returned to the public eye after her treatment for cancer, The Sunday Times of London reported that she was doing so with a caveat: She wanted to focus on her work, not her clothes. Her office would no longer share information about what she wore. Cue shock and horror. Even if it was understandable, given what she had been through, and even if the report was later disputed by the palace itself, it sent tremors through the fashion-watching community. That was partly because the princess could change the fortunes of a designer or a brand simply by wearing a dress. And it was partly because she had long used her place in the attention economy to shine a light not just on British products, but on issues like sustainability by remaking and rewearing pieces from her closet, and even renting the occasional evening gown. Mostly, though, it was because the clothes are an expression of her role as a symbol -- of the country and that fine line between continuity and modernization. Stepping back from one suggested she was stepping back from the other. It's a weird thing to essentially be an avatar, but it's the job. As her appearance at the Wimbledon men's and women's finals, and at the French state visit, demonstrated, however, Catherine may be more selective about her appearances (she did skip Ascot), but she is no less strategic. She is simply being Catherine 3.0. There she was, after all, at the state visit, welcoming Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron in a blush-colored Dior suit with a New Look jacket and a skirt covered in net, just brushing her calves. The brand is both classic French and about to be led by a designer from Northern Ireland who was trained in Britain. It was a considered nod to political alliance (the kind she has practiced since marrying Prince William) that she repeated at the French state banquet, wearing a red Givenchy gown with a built-in cape sweeping down from her shoulders. It was regal, sure, but also strategic, given that Givenchy is now designed by Sarah Burton, the British designer who made Catherine's wedding gown and who has been her collaborator on numerous high-profile public occasions. Talk about entente. And there Catherine was at the Wimbledon women's final in a cream jacket and long pleated skirt, a coolly appropriate riff on tennis whites and her position as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club. So, too, the royal blue ankle-length Roksanda dress she wore to the men's final was perfectly coordinated with Prince William's blue blazer, Prince George's blue suit and Princess Charlotte's white dress trimmed in blue, all creating a literal picture of family unity. All demonstrating that Catherine is as attuned as ever to the role image-making plays in her job. That's not new. What is new, however, is the style in which she is doing it, and its consistency. Her skirts have gotten longer, her jackets more tailored, her silhouette more streamlined. The effect of dropping her hemlines even a few inches is both oddly nostalgic and sophisticated, gently protective. A reminder that she is dressing for the long game. Like the lanky pantsuits she had adopted for her everyday appearances, her style is shaping up as a new formula for dressing. As recognizable, in its own way, as the monochrome formula that served Queen Elizabeth II so well: shoes-to-coat-to-dress-to-hat in one shade. And it brings a new dimension to the symbolism inherent in Catherine's role. She is representing not just the next generation of the royal family, which itself represents tradition. She is representing the idea of elegance emerging from adversity, an idea that has both micro and macro associations. Who couldn't use some of that right about now?"

""Romanticizing your life doesn't always mean spending lots of money"" to her means not buying a new ugly LV bag or DiOr earrings. She doesn't bother to stop and think that spending money to find beauty and meaning in your life, even at a lower price point, is still consumption and sort of runs counter to the original concept. It's similar to how ""self-care"" has been co-opted by capitalism, spreading the message that buying a face cream or spa membership is imperative to finding comfort and rejuvenation. You'd think that Gratitude Babe who waxed on about it after spending time in a developing country would show some examples of how to romanticize your life without tying it to purchases, but she's just as predictable as ever and still has to try to get those pennies. She never learns and she never will."

Originario di Caltanisetta, Classe 1957, entra in magistratura dal 1981 e si ""fa le ossa"" in Sicilia combattendo la mafia come pm a Palermo e in seguito come procuratore a Trapani. Prima di sbarcare a Milano al posto di Francesco Greco, fino al 2022 svolge il ruolo di procuratore generale di Firenze. Viola, il 'Papa straniero' nominato dal Csm, ora è a capo della procura che, come ricorda Il Giorno, nel 2015 vide lo scontro tra l'allora procuratore Edmondo Bruti Liberati e l'aggiunto Alfredo Robledo che accusava il suo capo di non voler indagare sugli appalti dell'Expo che Milano ospitò proprio dieci anni fa. Le indagini sulla gestione dell'urbanistica milanese nascono dagli esposti presentati anni fa dai residenti che ritenevano di essere stati danneggiati dalla costruzione delle nuove torri che sono sorte al posto di aree dismesse vicine alle loro case. Esposti su presunti abusi edilizi che hanno dato vita alle indagini affidate dalla procuratrice aggiunta Tiziana Siciliano a un pool di pm composto da Marina Petruzzella, Paolo Filippini e Mauro Clerici, che grazie al Nucleo di polizia economico finanziaria della Guardia di Finanza ha scoperchiato il business del mattone. I pm, nel decreto di perquisizione, evidenziano la “degenerazione della gestione urbanistica dell'amministrazione comunale di Milano i cui uffici, piuttosto che presidio di tutela dell'interesse pubblico e centro della pianificazione urbanistica sono stati asserviti alle utilità di una cerchia ristretta ed elitaria di soggetti privati che hanno imposto programmi e interventi di un'imponente e incontrollata espansione edilizia della città”. Le indagini della procura di Milano, coordinate dal pm Paolo Storari, hanno riguardato anche lo sfruttamento che c'è dietro il made in Italy e il mondo della moda e del lusso. Nel mirino della procura è recentemente finita Loro Piana e prima ancora Armani, Dior e Alviero Martini S.p.a., aziende che sono state sottoposte all'amministrazione giudiziaria. Procedimenti, questi ultimi, poi “tutti conclusi positivamente con la revoca della misura”, dopo percorsi virtuosi di bonifica. Le inchieste sul caporalato nella logistica e nei trasporti, infine, hanno permesso di recuperare somme milionarie e di mettere in regola migliaia di lavoratori.

Apparel Market Size Valuation Forecast: What Will the Market Be Worth by 2025? The size of the apparel market has seen significant growth over recent years. It's predicted to increase from $708.81 billion in 2024 to $766.62 billion in 2025, marking a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2%. This historic growth pattern can be credited to solid economic development in emerging markets, an influx in foreign direct investments, amplified demand for synthetic fibers, and advancements in technology. Apparel Market Size Forecast: What's the Projected Valuation by 2029? The size of the apparel market is projected to witness robust expansion in the forthcoming years, reaching $1012.31 billion in 2029 with a compounded annual growth rate of 7.2%. The anticipated growth during the forecast period is tied to the increasing pervasiveness of social media, a surge in motorcycle sales, the rise of e-commerce, and the escalating demand for sportswear and performance apparel. Key trends expected during this period encompass the adoption of blockchain technology for dependable supply chain management and intellectual property protection, the consideration of artificial intelligence usage for projecting trending themes in patterns, colours, and styles, a focus on recycling and upcycling to minimize waste, harnessing the Internet of Things (IoT) for the development of more creative products, and the integration of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies into physical and online stores to enrich the shopping experience.

The rising need for online shopping is anticipated to contribute to the growth of the apparel manufacturing industry. By selling their products on an expanded platform, manufacturers are now able to broaden their customer base geographically, thus stimulating the expansion of the apparel manufacturing market. In nations like India, for example, e-commerce platforms have amplified the sales of traditional clothing by providing wider exposure to manufacturers that were previously limited to the region where the weaving community resided.

Clothing production businesses are making substantial investments in computer-controlled embroidery equipment to enhance productivity and lower operational costs. These devices are essentially sewing-embroidery machines enabled with computer-based systems, carefully crafted for effective embroidery processes. Such equipment, used widely in industrial and commercial contexts, is designed to automatically produce a pattern on the fabric using a pre-specified digital embroidery design. There are single-needle versions requiring manual input for thread changes, and multi-needle ones featuring several sewing heads, which need a programmed sequence to change colors automatically. With digital formatting input, these machines can automatically fashion a variety of fabric effects, chain stitch embroidery, sequins, appliqué, cutwork, among others. They can execute tasks such as loading and adjusting designs, generating digitized design files, and overseeing the entire embroidery operation. Leading corporations offering these computerized embroidery machines to streamline clothing production include Richpeace, ZojeDayu, Happy, Unix, and Damei.

Celine新任創意總監Michael Rider是誰？ 3個重點認識他：原來是Old Celine時期員工回鍋
Celine 2026春季系列大秀亮點：
朴寶劍、金泰亨V掌握流量密碼
Celine 2026春季大秀發表之際，正好等到了品牌大使BTS成員金泰亨（V）退伍，這是他回歸後參與的第一場時尚盛事，加上因《苦盡柑來遇見你》再次爆紅的朴寶劍同樣名列嘉賓名單，讓這場秀早已充滿話題。 秀前一晚預熱活動上，朴寶劍與V離開時在場外的牽手互動成為社群瘋傳的焦點，秀上寶劍又與V留下了抱抱合影，毫不避諱展現兩人私下的好交情，也讓粉絲們看得好開心，簡直掌握了流量密碼。 絲巾串連故事
Celine 2026春季系列從絲巾開啟故事，邀請函奉上的絲巾，成為看秀嘉賓們的時尚單品，透過每個人不同的搭配方式，呼應Michael Rider的設計哲學：「服裝可以延續生命，成為穿著者生活的一部分。」 秀場上方亦掛上了巨大的絲巾，座位區則排列成Triomphe凱旋門Logo的圖案，氣派重釋經典。 Old Celine回歸？ 新任創意總監Michael Rider主導的第一章Celine 2026春季系列揭幕，可以確定的是，喜歡Old Celine的品牌老粉們會愛上！ 在精簡的輪廓、優雅選色上，皆能看見Phoebe Philo的影子；不過Michael Rider同樣保留了Hedi Slimane時期個性搖滾的一面（像是那逼人的緊身褲），再投入了他在Polo Ralph Lauren的美式作風，顯現在本季大量融入的學院風格，以及披肩毛衣、條紋領帶、鮮艷撞色……等細節上。 要說是Old Celine回歸也沒錯，不過經過Michael Rider內化的全新模樣，也是我們從未見過的！ 承襲經典的大宗旨下，他也悄悄放入了些玩味，極簡服裝對比繁複首飾（許多模特兒十指皆戴滿了戒指）、搶眼金屬裝飾、氣球褲搭配摔角靴，結合他最注重的實穿性單品，讓Celine變得沒這麼簡單、穿得更瀟灑自由。 Michael Rider的首秀聰明符合了大眾的期待，目前看來，他在新奇變化與市場審美的平衡間拿捏得宜，獲得許多正面評價。 其中「囧臉包」的回歸特別讓時尚迷們感到興奮，從「囧臉」變成「笑臉」的俏皮轉變，讓人也不禁微笑了！ 更多焦點Looks：

Raises the dopamine levels lol. I added pictures of every little detail on my pickups, the VCA is sterling silver, gold plated, for the price its rly good in my opinion, especially for those who cant grab the full solid gold ones... Even if I could I would probably not, since I'd be scared of losing them D: The sterling silver + gold plate VCA is $70 btw.

Last July 8, I tried a very popular PDRN Collagen Mask and it ended up burning my skin. During the 2 hours of it on my face and upon removing it and sleeping, I didn't feel anything weird. But when I washed my face the next day and put on my usual non-alcoholic gentle toners, I felt my face burning and saw it turned splotchy red. I washed my face again to remove the toners and I didn't want to put anything else. Then, I remembered I had this Madeca Cream from a previous PR package and tried it on to save my skin barrier. I patched test first and when I didn't feel the burning/stinging sensation, I ended up just using only this for more than a week. My skin still experienced peeling and burning (red splotches) on the 3rd-5th day but I can say it definitely helped alleviate what the collagen mask did to my face. The picture above is the latest photo I took of my skin (July 17). Without any base makeup, the redness is totally gone and the peeling stopped after 2 days. I said in my review of the cream on the Picky app that I will probably not repurchase but this experience definitely changed my mind. What I will not repurchase tho is that collagen mask 😅 I was too scared it will leave permanent marks on my face and I was so relieved it didn't"

El logo está perfectamente centrado y el diseño tiene ese toque elegante y moderno que buscaba. La tela es fina y ligera, muy cómoda, ideal para los días de calor o para combinarla con una chaqueta. Tenía ese típico olorcillo a prenda nueva, pero nada molesto y se fue con el primer lavado. Me la puse y sentó genial; talla como esperaba, aunque si prefieres algo más suelto te recomendaría pedir una talla más. En resumen, muy buena compra si te gusta vestir con estilo sin complicarte.

a6af5e54fc39d53c39bb7a203bab80e5,2025-07-17 20:53:00,en,WEB,"  Reggie Zippy Reportedly Arrested for Violation of Order Against His Ex-wife, His Associate Claims - Reggie Zippy has reportedly landed in police grips due to his longstanding issues with his ex-wife, Edith Ward - In a video, the musician's associate narrated how his friend was taken into custody and sent a message to his ex-wife - Reggie Zippy has been embroiled in a longstanding public spat with his ex-wife, Edith Ward, since their divorce in 2023 PAY ATTENTION: NOW You can COMMENT on our articles on the YEN website! Learn how to get started. UK-based Ghanaian musician Reginald Ainooson, popularly known as Reggie Zippy, has reportedly been arrested over his long-standing issues with his ex-wife Edith Ward. The musician's alleged associate, Phelipe Lyks Wangyims, shared the news of his alleged arrest in a video on Facebook on Thursday, July 17, 2025. According to the alleged associate, Reggie Zippy had been apprehended by the UK police on his birthday after his ex-wife, Edith Ward, filed a complaint about a social media post against him. Phelipe Lyks Wangyims had received news of his alleged impending arrest after he returned to the UK after visiting him in Zurich, Switzerland. He said that he and the musician's white girlfriend became worried and began searching after he went missing. They later found that he had been arrested. Following their interaction with the police, Phelipe Lyks Wangyims and Reggie Zippy's current girlfriend found out that the musician was allegedly in police custody for violating a non-molestation order. He also recounted the issues his friend had been going through since he and his ex-wife divorced a few years ago. Phelipe Lyks Wangyims accompanied the video with a lengthy caption, expressing his frustration with Reggy Zippy's predicament and narrating the circumstances that led to his alleged arrest. He wrote: ""I am not a happy man this morning. Yesterday was my brother Reggie Zippy's birthday, but because of how extremely busy I was at work, I only remembered late in the day to send him a public birthday message, with the intention of calling him later that evening to wish him properly."" ""But when I tried calling him later, both his phones were off. I assumed maybe he was just spending some quiet time with his girlfriend, Afia Broni, until I got a message from Afia saying she couldn't find him. She had driven around to all his usual hangout spots, but still no sign of him. That's when the worry kicked in."" ""Eventually, it made sense to contact the police, and to our shock, we found out that Reggy had been arrested. Why? Because his ex-wife Edith reported him for violating a Non-Molestation Order, all because of a Facebook post he made that she has interpreted to mean he was talking about her. That's it."" ""Now let me say this clearly; the only copy of that order I've seen came from a friend in Ghana, who got it through Edith herself. And from going through it, it was clear to me that this was just a gagging order, based on completely frivolous claims."" ""As I write this or make the video, I've still not been able to speak to Reggy personally, but I'm working behind the scenes to get him a solicitor and make sure this is taken up legally."" ""This is the first time I'm making a video openly speaking about the whole Reggy and Edith situation, and quite frankly, I'm doing this because I've had enough. Enough of Edith pulling strings from the background like a puppeteer, and whenever Reggy reacts emotionally (as anyone would), social media starts branding him the “UK Funny Face.” It's unfair, and it's exhausting. ""I don't know what Edith's endgame is, but let me be clear, she will be the one to lose in the end."" Reggie Zippy's divorce from Edith and fallout Reggie Zippy and Edith Ward were married for 15 years before officially divorcing on Friday, August 11, 2023. Following their bitter divorce, the former couple were embroiled in a social media beef, with the artiste accusing his ex-wife of denying him access to their three children and allegedly getting the police to arrest him on some false allegations. In a subsequent interview, Edith Ward denied Zippy's claims and called him out for being irresponsible. In November 2024, the ex-married couple reunited to celebrate their daughter Princess Dior's 10th birthday. However, their longstanding issues have persisted, with the UK-based musician regularly expressing his frustration about the matter. Reggie Zippy secures compensation in court case In another story reported by YEN.com.gh, Reggie Zippy secured compensation in a court case against the UK Police. In a video, the musician shared that the case revolved around multiple arrests by the police due to some allegations against him. Reggie Zippy spoke about the emotional toll his legal issues had on him and sent a message to his children.

1m2mo5a,2025-07-17 23:23:46,en,REDDIT,"  SCENE 24 – EXT. AIDAN'S FARM – MID-MORNING CARRIE arrives back at the farm in even higher heels than last time. She's dragging a soft pink weekender bag and wearing the gingham whale bonnet. She waves and starts down the narrow guesthouse stairs. A heel SNAPS. She lunges forward — arms windmilling — and lands squarely on: MATILDA, Aidan's beloved hen. The stiletto drives into MATILDA'S neck with surgical precision. Blood spatters across CARRIE'S bonnet and her Khaite Mallory maxi trench. WYATT, AIDAN, and KATHY watch as MATILDA bleeds out. WYATT screams. KATHY drops her travel mug. MATILDA convulses once. Then dies. Beat. AIDAN (quietly) You killed Matilda. CARRIE (looking at her heel, dazed) She ran into me. AIDAN (sobbing) We're done. He buys CARRIE a one-way Greyhound ticket to Port Authority — on her Amex. SCENE 25 – EXT. HANDSOME POND ROAD – LATER CARRIE waits four hours for the bus. She stands alone, the bloody bonnet flapping softly in the wind. SCENE 26 – INT. GREYHOUND BUS – MOVING – LATER CARRIE boards, sighs wistfully, and opens Amazon. As they pass through Newark, she orders ten more packs of faux Wisteria to hang over the Gramercy ironwork — “for closure.” SCENE 27 – INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT – EARLY EVENING CARRIE sits at her vintage mid century dining table — Aidan's parting gift. She pecks out the final sentences of The Woman on handmade 19th-century paper, fed through a restored Remington No. 2 typewriter. She's still wearing the blood-soaked bonnet. It's her Jackie Kennedy moment. Nearby, a bottle of Mexican Coke sweats gently on the windowsill. The keys click rhythmically. The light is golden. She types: “The woman understood that love isn't linear. It's a loop. Like a bonnet ribbon...."

The former Playboy Bunny looked nearly ageless as she strutted in a floral bikini top, paired with tiny white bottoms and a sheer maxi skirt in Saint Tropez, France. In new photos obtained by TMZ, Silvstedt was seen arriving at the iconic Club 55 along the blue waters of the French Riviera. Wearing oversized white sunglasses, the Swedish star smiled in nearly every shot as walked along the boardwalk. According to her Instagram Story, Silvstedt is in town for a Dior event. She posted a video of herself sunbathing on a boat before heading to the exclusive designer dinner. Later that evening, she shared glimpses of the candlelight meal with other notable guests. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Victoria Silvstedt Official (@victoriasilvstedt) Silvstedt first gained international fame in 1993 when she was crowned Miss Sweden. She later skyrocketed to stardom after being named Playboy's Playmate of the Year in 1997. In addition to her modeling success — including being a Guess? spokesmodel and walking the runway for high-fashion labels like Chanel, Giorgio Armani and Valentino — Silvstedt also dabbled into music. Her debut album Girl on the Run featured the lead single “Hello Hey,” which peaked at No. 7 on the Swedish Singles Chart. While she began modeling decades ago, Silvstedt has maintained her youthful appearance and continues to impress fans with her toned figure. She's been open about the routines that help her stay in shape over the years. ""I do yoga and I run, but I swear I lose more weight shaking my booty at parties,"" she once admitted in an interview. In another sit down, she revealed her go-to activities, including, ""power walks, Pilates and tennis” — so basically any sport. ""My routine has definitely become more disciplined with time! I take plenty of supplements like collagen, and I add vegan protein, chia, and flax seeds to my diet,"" she said of her diet. ""I'm also a big fan of adding superfoods like kelp and spirulina."""

I'm in a more comfortable situation at the moment. I bought some 2ml samples from Amazon to see what I might like. I liked the Dior Jadore eau de toilette. It's so clean and pretty! I saw on Google that Mon Amour Paris for women was similar, so I bought a bottle, and I think it is pretty close. This stuff was around fifteen dollars, I think? I was wondering if it would be worth it to buy a bottle of the real thing. I don't have an educated nose in any way. Also, does anyone know of any other scents that are similar to this one?

While she began modeling decades ago, Silvstedt has maintained her youthful appearance and continues to impress fans with her toned figure. She's been open about the routines that help her stay in shape over the years. "" I do yoga and I run, but I swear I lose more weight shaking my booty at parties,"" she once admitted in an interview . In another sit down , she revealed her go-to activities, including, ""power walks, Pilates and tennis” — so basically any sport. ""My routine has definitely become more disciplined with time! I take plenty of supplements like collagen, and I add vegan protein, chia, and flax seeds to my diet,"" she said of her diet. ""I'm also a big fan of adding superfoods like kelp and spirulina."""

Acteur majeur du transport dans les Hauts-de-France depuis 1957, Alain Place a remis les clés de ses 340 autocars et roule déjà vers de nouvelles aventures. Néo-vigneron, il vient de racheter château Réal d'Or. Article réservé aux abonnés Idelette Fritsch / ifritsch@nicematin.fr Publié le 18/07/2025 à 06:15, mis à jour le 18/07/2025 à 06:15 Alain Place, entouré de sa fille Alice et de son épouse, Brigitte. Photos I. F. Trois choses qu'il faut savoir sur Alain Place. À soixante-neuf ans, ce ""faux retraité"" a le business chevillé au corps – selon ses proches, c'est ""un bourreau de travail"" –, il entreprend toujours en famille, alors qu'humilité et succès vont de pair dans tous ses projets. ""Vous avez devant vous quelqu'un qui a conduit des autocars pendant quatorze ans, de 1976 à 1990. Ces années passées sur les routes, ça laisse du temps pour méditer"", plante l'ex-patron et héritier de l'entreprise familiale Place mobilité, fondée à Trith-Saint-Léger (près de Valenciennes) il y a soixante-huit ans, devenue un acteur majeur du transport dans les Hauts-de-France. Le chapitre de la mobilité Une success story bâtie ex nihilo, dans le berceau de la sidérurgie nordiste. ""Mon père, Auguste Place, était ajusteur outilleur chez Usinor (leader européen de la sidérurgie jusqu'à la fermeture des hauts fourneaux de Denain, en 1988, Ndlr). Il enchaînait les petits boulots après ses huit heures d'usine. En avril 1957, il a acheté un petit car et ouvert le chapitre familial de la mobilité que j'ai développé en diversifiant l'activité: ajout d'une prestation au transport avec le tourisme en autocar, dans les années 1990 développement des voyages en avions et bateaux via notre filiale Place Voyages (cédée en 2023), puis au tournant des années 2000, le transport scolaire qui a conforté notre croissance exponentielle"", retrace Alain Place. En avril 2025, ce Chti devenu vigneron à partir de 2012, au domaine de l'Heure Bleue à Gonfaron (lire par ailleurs), a définitivement fermé le chapitre de la mobilité, en cédant les clés de sa société à l'autocariste français Transarc. Au moment de la cession: 450 salariés, 340 autocars, 15.000 scolaires transportés par jour grâce à quatre délégations de service public dans les Hauts-de-France. Autant dire, un bolide lancé sur le segment des opérateurs indépendants du transport interurbain. Réal d'Or, le challenge du néovigneron ""Il n'y avait pas de volonté de reprise chez mes quatre filles, elles font toutes des métiers sympas"", clarifie l'homme d'affaires, tout à son nouveau projet dans la plaine des Maures. Avec le rachat, le 9 octobre, des 67 hectares du château Réal d'Or (pour un montant non communiqué), un nouveau chantier s'ouvre à l'appétit de l'entrepreneur. ""Il y a des fantasmes financiers sur cette session - nous sommes tenus à des clauses de confidentialité par les vendeurs. C'est un achat raisonnable, parce qu'on a repris des bâtiments performants, un vignoble en production, mais l'activité commerciale était à relancer complètement"", assure le néovigneron. Ses nouveaux bureaux regardent vers les 27 hectares de vignes qu'il vient de convertir en bio. Des quelques cartons encore à déballer, Alain Place sort une collection de maquettes, des autocars, des bateaux, un avion Boeing 747, un morceau de parquet à l'effigie du club de basket de Denain Voltaire qu'il a présidé (de 1995 à 2003) et relancé (de 2013 à 2019). Son bureau pourtant, n'a rien d'une chambre d'enfant! Chez Alain Place, le business est toujours en embuscade. ll faut, dans les prochaines semaines, finaliser les travaux du caveau de vente qui rouvrira en juillet, conforter les ventes des vins sur le segment CHR (cavistes, hôtels, restaurants), ""développer notre présence dans le grand Sud, les Hauts-de-France et en Belgique qui sont notre premier marché pour les vins de l'Heure Bleue"", étaye l'investisseur, bien décidé à mutualiser les productions de ses deux domaines varois. ""J'ai très vite compris qu'il y avait ici un outil de production remarquable, ça a allumé une double lumière en moi: celle de la diversification vers l'hébergement et l'œnotourisme, celle de la mutualisation des outils de production. Avec les dix hectares de l'Heure Bleue, la rentabilité est impossible pour des gens comme moi. À la différence d'un vigneron qui s'occupe de tout, je n'ai pas coché les cases pour monter sur le tracteur"", reconnaît le nouveau patron de Réal d'Or, dont le rôle sera ""davantage d'être dans l'accompagnement"". ""C'est un fonceur"" Son entourage le dit prudent, méticuleux, très perfectionniste, ""mais paradoxalement c'est un fonceur"", nuance sa fille, Alice. Au château Réal d'Or, Alain Place a foncé, mais conservé les équipes en place, la maître de chai Murielle Schlicklin, l'œnologue-conseil Jérôme Paquette. Un modèle de management dont il escompte un certain succès. ""J'ai appris à m'entourer de gens plus forts et plus compétents que moi dans leurs spécificités"", assure-t-il. Fidèle à sa culture entrepreneuriale, Alain Place ouvre en famille, le nouveau chapitre de la diversification provençale avec sa fille Alice, revenue développer l'hébergement et l'œnotourisme, après un premier parcours professionnel: école de commerce, Institut Français de la Mode (IFM) en section marketing développement et produit, dix ans d'expérience dans le secteur du luxe, en accessoire et joaillerie (pour Hermès, Cartier, Chanel, Dior, Bulgari, etc.), là aussi un bolide. ""L'idée ici, c'est de faire du beau, de sublimer l'endroit, en proposant dix chambres dans une nature dominante"", commente la jeune femme, alignée sur les mêmes valeurs que son père. ""Tous les blocs sont réunis, le bloc vin, le bloc famille, le bloc transmission"", lui fait écho ce dernier. Méticulosité et précision, on ne refait pas Alain Place! L'aventure de l'Heure Bleue ""Une maison dans le Midi, des amis pour la vie"", plaisante volontiers Alain Place. C'est en venant visiter à Gonfaron des connaissances du Nord, fascinées comme eux par la lumière du Sud, qu'Alain et son épouse Brigitte Place sont devenus vignerons, en 2012. ""On a eu un coup de cœur pour l'endroit qu'on a racheté, à 300mètres d'altitude au pied de Notre-Dame-des-Anges. Il y avait deux solutions, soit on prenait un fermage et nos raisins partaient à la coopérative, soit on faisait du vin. Le côté entrepreneur a repris le dessus"", explique Alain Place. Le vignoble de 10 hectares, entièrement restructuré, est converti en bio dès 2016. Les vins rosés et blancs jusqu'à présent vinifiés chez Jean-Pierre Daziano (domaine de la Fouquette), intégreront la cuverie de château Réal d'Or dès la vendange 2025.

Una perfecta excusa para viajar a este país y descubrir por qué las presentaciones de colecciones son como son hoy en día. El verano es la mejor temporada para visitar museos: ¡cuantos más, mejor! Seguro que ya tienes fichadas algunas galerías o centros culturales para tus vacaciones. A esa lista deberías sumar esta exposición sobre desfiles de moda que acabamos de descubrir. Aunque se inaugura el 18 de octubre y tendrá lugar en el Vitra Design Museum, en Alemania, merece la pena reservar unos días para ir. La muestra recorre la historia del desfile de moda, desde sus inicios en 1900 hasta la actualidad. Arriba: Imagen de desfile de Chanel en 2017. Crédito: Helmut Fricke / Abajo: Fotografía en blanco y negro de un desfile de Rabanne. Crédito: Alain Loison La exposición se titula “Catwalk: The Art of the Fashion Show” y reúne imágenes, piezas originales, escenografía, documentos y otros elementos que revelan el detrás de escena de los desfiles de moda. ¿Tienes las vacaciones en septiembre y aún no sabes qué hacer? Es normal: hay mucha oferta, pero también ganas de hacer algo diferente que no sea solo playa o montaña. Nuestra propuesta: una escapada cultural al Vitra Design Museum, en Alemania. Allí se presentará una exposición que te encantará —y que podría valer como un máster intensivo—. Nos referimos a la esperada muestra Catwalk: The Art of the Fashion Show, dedicada al mundo de los desfiles de moda. Quizá ya la hayas visto anunciada en redes sociales. Esta exposición ofrece un recorrido histórico único que te ayudará a entender por qué los desfiles actuales son como son, y cuál es su papel en la narrativa y la identidad de una marca. Desde los primeros shows en 1900 hasta las presentaciones más actuales, verás imágenes, documentos y ejemplos de casas como Balenciaga, Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Helmut Lang, Martin Margiela o Prada. Y como sabemos que te gusta llevar los deberes hechos, estate atento: te contaremos más detalles para que llegues con la lección aprendida. Desfile de Dries van Noten. Crédito: Helmut Fricke. Tres ejemplos de fotografías que podrás ver en la exposición sobre desfiles en el Vitra Design Museum. Fotografía de desfile de Paul Poiret de 1910. Crédito: Henri Manuel. Desfile de maniquíes de Paul Poiret en su jardín de París. Esta imagen tiene una gran carga simbólica, histórica y artística. Se trata de lo que muchos consideran el primer desfile de moda moderno. Los diseños pertenecen a Paul Poiret, un diseñador francés que rompía con las normas de su época. Esta fotografía es una prueba clara de su revolución estética. Observa cómo las mujeres aparecen liberadas del corsé, vistiendo siluetas sueltas e inspiradas en estilos exóticos de Oriente Medio y Asia. Desfile de Chanel en la colección primavera-verano 2015. Crédito: Helmut Fricke. Desfile de Chanel con la colección Primavera-Verano 2015 en París. Con esta imagen, viajamos varias décadas hacia adelante. Como ya te contamos, esta exposición sobre desfiles de moda en el Vitra Design Museum abarca todas las épocas, y por eso no podía faltar este momento icónico: el desfile de Chanel primavera-verano 2015. Fue uno de los más comentados de la temporada, y no solo por la moda. Chanel ha conseguido unir diseño y mensaje social en una puesta en escena que fue mucho más que un desfile: una auténtica manifestación. Las modelos desfilaron con pancartas y mensajes como: Féministe mais féminine, Ladies First o History is Her Story. Show de Jacquemus en 2020. Crédito: Alamy Desfile de Jacquemus con la colección Le Coup de Soleil. Terminamos este pequeño recorrido por la muestra con el desfile viral e inspirador de Jacquemus. ¿Qué tiene de especial este desfile? Aunque quizás no lo notes a simple vista, este show fue un antes y un después gracias al protagonismo del escenario. El diseñador francés fue hasta un campo de trigo en la región de Val-d'Oise, cerca de París, para presentar sus nuevas colecciones. Aquí queda clara la importancia del entorno exterior para comprender y apreciar mejor las prendas."

mov_1480FE2F66456D821BEA3DE7B6C837E6,2025-07-18 14:20:30,en,WEB,"  Quick Answer Who makes Dior jewellery? Dior's high jewellery is designed and crafted in France, but not all of the brand's jewellery is made there. For special collections and intricate handwork, Dior collaborates with skilled artisans all over the world, including India. Costume jewellery and components may be produced or assembled elsewhere, including in China. The Illusion of 100% “Made in France” Luxury brands like Dior sell more than jewellery; they sell an image. “Made in France” suggests artisans working in light-filled Parisian workshops, hand-setting diamonds in silence. And while that's partly true for Dior's Haute Joaillerie line, it's far from the whole picture. Today's luxury industry runs on global production. To keep up with demand, and to access the best traditional craftsmanship, Dior, like many luxury maisons, relies on a mix of in-house ateliers and long-standing external partners across continents. Read – Jewellery Trends for 2025 – From Fashion to High Jewellery Dior's Mumbai Collection: A Testament to Indian Artistry One of the most visible acknowledgements of Dior's global sourcing came with the Fall 2023 Mumbai Collection. The show, staged in front of the Gateway of India, celebrated the deep creative friendship between Maria Grazia Chiuri, Dior's former artistic director, and Karishma Swali, director of Chanakya ateliers and the Chanakya School of Craft. For over two decades, Chanakya has produced exquisite hand-embroidery, textile art, and jewellery detailing for Dior's most intricate pieces. In the Mumbai Collection, Indian artisans weren't behind the scenes—they were the stars. The show featured: Jewellery and embroidery entirely handmade in India Craft rooted in centuries-old techniques, passed down through generations A spotlight on female empowerment through Chanakya's work with women artisans This collaboration is a counter-narrative to the typical outsourcing story. It's not about cutting costs; it's about preserving vanishing traditions and elevating them on a global stage. Who Makes Dior Jewellery—Really? Let's break it down: Type of JewelleryWhere It's MadeHaute Joaillerie (Fine Jewellery)Designed and crafted in Paris, often with French-sourced gemsSpecial collaborations (e.g. Mumbai Collection)Handcrafted in India, especially at Chanakya ateliersCostume jewelleryOften assembled in Europe, with components possibly sourced from China or Thailand At the helm of Dior's jewellery design is Victoire de Castellane, the long-time Artistic Director of Dior Joaillerie. Known for her bold, storytelling-rich aesthetic, Castellane has transformed the house's jewellery into miniature fairy tales of colour, movement, and meaning. Interestingly, she's also the sister of Mathilde Favier, the influential Head of PR Worldwide at Dior Couture, a dynamic sibling duo shaping both the image and the sparkle of the Dior universe. India's Historic Role in Jewellery Making India isn't new to high jewellery; in fact, it's where the world once looked for it. For centuries, India was a global centre for gemstone trade, diamond cutting, and gold craftsmanship. The Mughal Empire left behind a legacy of lavish, intricate jewels combining Persian, Hindu, and Islamic artistry. British royalty, including Queen Elizabeth II, received gifts of jewellery from Indian maharajas, such as the legendary Hyderabad Necklace, a diamond masterpiece that remains one of the Queen's most famous pieces. Today, cities like Jaipur and Surat continue this legacy, the latter being home to 90% of the world's diamond cutting and polishing. So when Dior entrusts Indian ateliers like Chanakya with delicate embroidery and jewellery-making, it's not outsourcing, it's recognising generations of skill and prestige. China's Role: The Fast-Paced Side of Luxury China, on the other hand, plays a different role. It's more commonly used in costume jewellery production: Mass manufacturing Moulding and casting of metal components Enamelling, stone setting, or assembly for seasonal accessories While this allows brands like Dior to release more affordable, trendy lines, it also raises questions about: Labour conditions Wage disparity Transparency in the lower tiers of the supply chain These are the aspects luxury brands often omit from their glossy marketing materials. Transparency in Luxury: Still a Work in Progress RJC (Responsible Jewellery Council) certifications don't always guarantee fair labour practices Most brands don't disclose full details of their supply chains..."

mov_503981BBB338F350B0CB3E22064C4C86,2025-07-18 19:13:29,en,WEB,"  ABSTRACT Nina Christen designed some of the most influential shoes of the last decade. Now she has a line of her own. FULL TEXT Back in late 2018, a lifetime ago in fashion, a radical shift happened in footwear. Square-toed clunkers - sandals defined by exaggerated, spatula-like soles that jutted out from under the foot and pumps with bulbous stubbed toes - were shown in Daniel Lee's first collection for Bottega Veneta. At first sight, the shoes were hideous. Within months, they were on the feet of nearly every celebrity, editor, influencer and luxury V.I.C. in the land. Retailers like Vince Camuto and Shein promptly issued dupes of the popular Lido sandal, a simple slide in a blown-up interpretation of Bottega's signature intrecciato woven leather. Lyst declared them the ""hottest shoes in the world"" in 2019. ""It's funny what you can make people wear in fashion if it's done the right way,"" said Nina Christen, the Swiss shoe designer responsible for the Lido. Ms. Christen's distinctive touch has quite literally been all over some of the most influential shoe design trickling down from luxury houses for the better part of the last decade. She has worked for Phoebe Philo at Celine, Jonathan Anderson at Loewe, Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen at the Row and Mr. Lee at Bottega Veneta. Last month, Mr. Anderson hired Ms. Christen as the design director of shoes at Christian Dior. It's one of the biggest jobs in fashion right now, and she is balancing it with a moonlighting gig, too. Last year, Ms. Christen introduced Christen, her own independent shoe brand. The first pure expression of her design identity came partly out of frustration. The shoes she designed for other brands were her taste, her take, she said, ""but they were never 100 percent myself."" Opportunity arose when she met Paul Dupuy, an entrepreneur and a founder of Zoi, a health-tech company in the longevity space. Ms. Christen designed uniforms for Zoi's staff and clients, and Mr. Dupuy was so impressed that he offered to help her start her own brand. His mother was a fashion designer, and he has friends in the industry. He got it. ""When she told me she designed shoes for Loewe and Bottega, I was like: 'OK. This is solid,'"" Mr. Dupuy said. Ms. Christen already had a complete vision for a brand beyond shoes: the perfect pair of Japanese denim jeans, the perfect leather jacket, even fine jewelry, the first piece of which is a diamond toe ring. All are prototyped and planned. She had the packaging, branding, logo and positioning in mind. Mr. Dupuy raised $5 million in capital and helps with business logistics, including with the planning of a store in Paris slated for 2026. Christen shoes are produced in Italy by the same factories and specialists that work with big luxury brands. The prices - $1,100 to $3,650 - reflect Ms. Christen's uncompromising production standards and ambition to compete at the highest level. On a morning in late June, the raw cement floor of the studio below Ms. Christen's apartment in Paris was set with more than 30 examples of her designs arranged in a neatly art-directed grid. Three styles from Loewe's spring 2023 runway collection stood out for their cartoonish, fantastical qualities: There were pumps embroidered with an explosion of deflated white balloons and sandals abloom with a giant, hyper-realistic anthurium. Red rubber pumps that looked fit for Minnie Mouse were particularly complicated. ""You can't wear this for more than two hours,"" Ms. Christen said of the pumps. ""But Jonathan Anderson was very open to ideas that really crossed the line between art and fashion."" By comparison, the Christen styles on display appeared compact, sexy and razor-sharp. ""I love the space of geometric shapes,"" Ms. Christen said, surveying the body of work at her feet. ""When I think of toe shapes, for example, it's all about that. Is it a square? Is it rectangle? Is it a circle? Is it oval? What is the degree?"" She wore a pair of Christen white sandals that left the foot nearly naked, bisecting it with a single strip of leather like a strand of floss through the big and second toes. The sole was thin and slightly elongated under the toes, like an insole that was a size too big. The proportions of the shoes varied wildly, but a common thread was a certain offness. Ms. Christen thinks a lot about redefining standards. ""It's about creating things we are not used to yet,"" she said. ""When I make something and I don't know if I like it, that's always a good sign."" Ms. Christen, 40, grew up in Bern, Switzerland, ""obsessed with fashion without an explanation,"" she said...."

mov_9E3C81F41361729195AF80AB490A9CF9,2025-07-18 23:04:03,en,WEB,"  A recent controversy surrounding Italian luxury label Prada has put the spotlight on how global fashion giants engage with India - a country whose rich artistic traditions have often suffered because of its inability to cash in on them. Prada got into trouble in June after its models walked the runway in Milan wearing , a handcrafted leather shoe made in India. The sandals are named after Kolhapur - a town in the western state of Maharashtra where they have been made for centuries - but the Prada collection did not mention this, prompting a backlash. As the controversy grew, Prada issued a statement saying it acknowledged the sandals' origins and that it was open to a ""dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans"". Over the past few days, a team from Prada met the artisans and shopkeepers in Kolhapur who make and sell the sandals to understand the process. Prada told the BBC that it held a ""successful meeting"" with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture, a prominent industry trade group. The statement also indicates that Prada may potentially collaborate in future with some manufacturers of Kolhapuri footwear. While it's not clear what form this collaboration may take, it's a rare example of a global fashion giant acknowledging that it failed to credit local artisans and the craft it was piggybacking on. Many big brands have been routinely accused of drawing inspiration from Indian, and wider South Asian, traditions in their quest to reinvent and stay relevant - but without crediting the source. Earlier this year, spring designs from Reformation and H&M after many said that their outfits appeared heavily inspired by South Asian garments. Both brands issued clarifications - while H&M denied the allegations, Reformation said its design was inspired by an outfit owned by a model with whom it had collaborated for the collection. And just two weeks ago, Dior was criticised after its highly-anticipated Paris collection featured a gold and ivory houndstooth coat, which many pointed out was crafted with mukaish work, a centuries-old metal embroidery technique from northern India. The collection did not mention the roots of the craft or India at all. The BBC has reached out to Dior for comment. Some experts say that not every brand that draws inspiration from a culture does so with wrong intentions - designers around the world invoke aesthetics from different traditions all the time, spotlighting them on a global scale. In the highly competitive landscape of fashion, some argue that brands also don't get enough time to think through the cultural ramifications of their choices. But critics point out that any borrowing needs to be underpinned by respect and acknowledgement, especially when these ideas are repurposed by powerful global brands to be sold at incredibly high prices. ""Giving due credit is a part of design responsibility, it's taught to you in design school and brands need to educate themselves about it,"" says Shefalee Vasudev, a Delhi-based fashion writer. Not doing so, she adds, is ""cultural neglect towards a part of the world which brands claim to love"". Estimates vary about the size of India's luxury market, but the region is widely seen as a big growth opportunity. Analysts from Boston Consulting Group say the luxury retail market in India by 2032. Powered by an expanding and affluent middle class, global luxury brands are increasingly eyeing India as a key market as they hope to make up for weaker demand elsewhere. But not everyone shares the optimism. Arvind Singhal, chairman of consultancy firm Technopak, says a big reason for the seeming indifference is that most brands still don't consider India a significant market for high-end luxury fashion. In recent years, many high-end malls with flagship luxury stores have opened up in big cities - but they rarely see significant footfall. ""Names like Prada still mean nothing to a majority of Indians. There is some demand among the super-rich, but hardly any first-time customers,"" Mr Singhal says. ""And this is simply not enough to build a business, making it easy to neglect the region altogether."" Anand Bhushan, a fashion designer from Delhi, agrees. He says that traditionally, India has always been a production hub rather than a potential market, with some of the most expensive brands in Paris and Milan employing Indian artisans to make or embroider their garments. ""But that still does not mean you can just blatantly lift a culture without understanding the history and context and brand it for millions of dollars,"" he adds. The frustration, he says, is not focused on any one label but has been building for years. The most memorable misstep, according to him, took place during the Karl Lagerfeld ""Paris-Bombay"" Métiers d'Art collection, showcased in 2011. The collection featured sari-draped dresses, Nehru-collared jackets and ornate headpieces. Many called it a fine example of cultural collaboration, but others argued it relied heavily on clichéd imagery and lacked authentic representation of India. Others, however, say no brand can afford to write off India as insignificant. ""We might not be the fastest-growing luxury market like China, but a younger and more sophisticated generation of Indians with different tastes and aspirations is reshaping the landscape of luxury,"" says Nonita Kalra, editor-in-chief of online luxury store Tata CliQ Luxury. In the case of Prada, she says the brand seemed to have made a ""genuine oversight"", evident from the lengths to which it has gone to rectify its mistake. For Ms Kalra, the problem is a broader one - where brands based in the west and run by a homogenous group of people end up viewing consumers in other parts of the world through a foreign lens. ""The lack of diversity is the biggest blind spot of the fashion industry, and brands need to hire people from different parts of the world to change that,"" she says. ""But their love and respect for Indian heritage is genuine."" The question of cultural appropriation is complex, and the debates it sparks online can seem both overblown and eye-opening. And while there are no simple answers, many feel the outrage around Prada has been a great starting point to demand better accountability from brands and designers who, until now, have largely remained unchallenged. It is an opportunity for India, too, to reflect on the ways it can support its own heritage and uplift it. Weavers toil for weeks or months to finish one masterpiece, but they often work in precarious conditions without adequate remuneration and with no protection for their work under international intellectual property laws. ""We don't take enough pride and credit our own artisans, allowing others to walk all over it,"" Ms Vasudev says. ""The trouble also is that in India we have simply too much. There are hundreds of different craft techniques and traditions - each with its constantly evolving motif directory going back centuries,"" says Laila Tyabji, chairperson of Dastkar, which promotes crafts and craftspeople. ""We bargain and bicker over a pair of fully embroidered juthis (shoes) but have no issues over buying a pair of Nike trainers at 10 times the price - even though the latter has come off an assembly line while each juthi has been painstakingly and uniquely crafted by hand,"" she says. And while that continues, she says, foreign designers and merchandisers will do the same...."
mov_E5231A270BBCF114FD0CBFB1A38BCA07,2025-07-18 23:04:03,en,WEB,"  A recent controversy surrounding Italian luxury label Prada has put the spotlight on how global fashion giants engage with India - a country whose rich artistic traditions have often suffered because of its inability to cash in on them. Prada got into trouble in June after its models walked the runway in Milan wearing a toe-braided sandal that looked like the Kolhapuri chappal, a handcrafted leather shoe made in India. The sandals are named after Kolhapur - a town in the western state of Maharashtra where they have been made for centuries - but the Prada collection did not mention this, prompting a backlash. As the controversy grew, Prada issued a statement saying it acknowledged the sandals' origins and that it was open to a ""dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans"". Over the past few days, a team from Prada met the artisans and shopkeepers in Kolhapur who make and sell the sandals to understand the process. Prada told the BBC that it held a ""successful meeting"" with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture, a prominent industry trade group. The statement also indicates that Prada may potentially collaborate in future with some manufacturers of Kolhapuri footwear. While it's not clear what form this collaboration may take, it's a rare example of a global fashion giant acknowledging that it failed to credit local artisans and the craft it was piggybacking on. Many big brands have been routinely accused of drawing inspiration from Indian, and wider South Asian, traditions in their quest to reinvent and stay relevant - but without crediting the source. Earlier this year, spring designs from Reformation and H&M ignited a fiery debate on cultural appropriation after many said that their outfits appeared heavily inspired by South Asian garments. Both brands issued clarifications - while H&M denied the allegations, Reformation said its design was inspired by an outfit owned by a model with whom it had collaborated for the collection. And just two weeks ago, Dior was criticised after its highly-anticipated Paris collection featured a gold and ivory houndstooth coat, which many pointed out was crafted with mukaish work, a centuries-old metal embroidery technique from northern India. The collection did not mention the roots of the craft or India at all. The BBC has reached out to Dior for comment.

Peach Slices Redness Relief Color Correcting Cream for those days when your skin seems to be pitching a fit about one thing or another. This not only provides soothing, moisturizing ingredients like aloe and green algae, but it also has a subtle color-correcting tint that tones down redness. Think of it as a little tube of damage control for when your skin needs extra TLC. Promising review: ""I'm not one to normally leave reviews, but this is worth it. I've literally had this product for two days. I have severe rosacea on my nose. It's so bad I usually have to wear foundation to hide it because it's so noticeable. I've tried numerous products and serums with no luck, and honestly, I didn't expect this one to be any different. However, after only two days (probably applying it 4–5 times), almost all of the redness is gone! I'm in disbelief at the wonders it has done. I will without a doubt be stocking up on this product!"" —Tiffany Price: $19.88 2. Neutrogena Collagen Bank Facial Moisturizer that's basically an investment in your future face. Collagen can help keep things pinchably plump, bouncy, and glowy, which is great. But the real power player in this cream is the bakuchiol — an active ingredient which can boost cell turnover and smooth skin texture — which is basically retinol's less dramatic cousin. No joke, this study suggests that bakuchiol is just as effective as retinol while being way less likely to cause irritation. So basically, you get all the glow with none of the drama. It's a win-win. Promising review: ""The Neutrogena Collagen Bank moisturizer is making my skin feel smoother. It does not irritate my skin, and I really like the dispenser. I plan to keep using it."" —Serendipity Price: $22.97 3. Aquaphor Lip Repair Ointment to rescue your lips when they feel like they've survived a beating. With a powerhouse blend of shea butter, beeswax, vitamin E, and chamomile, this ultra-soothing balm helps restore moisture, calms irritation, and keeps flakes at bay. Stop peeling and start slathering. Promising review: ""This product is highly recommended for maintaining moisture or replenishing moisture to chapped lips. I have sold lip conditioners that were 20 bucks. No need to pay that much money. Use this!"" —Tina Price: $8.36 for two 4. Or NYX Professional Makeup Fat Oil for a hydration boost that also gives your lips a juicy shine. With lots of moisturizing and antioxidant-rich ingredients, this lip oil is protective, long-lasting, and nonsticky. The gorg hint of color and lovely scent are just icing on the cake. Promising review: ""Lovely consistency. Not too sticky. Very hydrating. Smell is pleasant and not overpowering.

Namun, Anderson sedikit memiringkan pita tersebut, mirip dengan bagaimana ia melapisi dasi jas di atas kerah yang tersorot pada koleksi busana pria Spring 2026. Untuk bagian aksesori, Jisoo menambahkan sentuhan grunge pada pakaian femininnya dengan sepatu bot setinggi lutut dari studio Prancis dengan harga 2,2 ribu dolar AS (sekitar Rp35 juta). Sepatu ini terbuat dari kulit mengkilap dan memiliki tumit tebal, cocok untuk menunjang penampilan panggung idola berusia 30 tahun tersebut. Pemilik nama Kim Jisoo ini jadi duta global Dior untuk mode dan kecantikan pada Maret 2021. Sejak itu, ia dikenal sebagai ""Human Dior"" karena sering mengenakan barang label tersebut. Hubungannya dengan Dior tampaknya tetap kuat di era Anderson, dengan Jisoo menulis di unggahan Instagram-nya, baru-baru ini, ""Tidak sabar untuk mengenakan lebih banyak gaya."" Pelantun lagu FLOWER ini tidak pernah melewatkan pesta Dior selama masa jabatan mantan direktur kreatif Maria Grazia Chiuri. Ia telah menghadiri setiap peragaan busana sejak September 2021, sambil membintangi berbagai kampanye mode dan kecantikan. Baru-baru ini, Jisoo mengamankan tempat duduk di barisan depan untuk presentasi Dior Fall/Winter 2025. Sebelum pertunjukan, ia melambaikan tangan pada para penggemar, mengenakan blus putih berkorset, rok hitam berenda, dan sepatu bot bertali. Jisoo memiliki tas D-Journey, D-Motion, dan D-Vibe, tapi saat itu, ia membawa tas Lady Dior yang langka. Jisoo adalah penggemar berat Dior seumur hidup, terlepas dari siapa yang memimpin. Ia kemungkinan besar sudah mengonfirmasi kehadirannya di peragaan busana wanita perdana Anderson pada Oktober 2025. Tampilan Jisoo di panggung baru-baru ini menggenapi kebahagiaan BLINK, sebutan penggemar grup tersebut. Setelah penantian yang terasa seperti selamanya, keempat personel BLACKPINK akhirnya kembali beraktivitas sebagai grup. Ini bukan sekadar konser comeback biasa. Mengutip Times of India, Jumat (18/7/2025), BLACKPINK merupakan girl group K-pop pertama yang tampil di Stadion Goyang, Korea Selatan, dengan 78 ribu penggemar hadir selama dua malam pertunjukan. Jumlah ini mencetak rekor jumlah penonton terbanyak yang pernah dicapai artis K-pop mana pun. Jumlah itu lebih banyak daripada jumlah penonton di beberapa kota. Tiga hari setelah konser, tepatnya pada 8 Juli 2025, Jisoo membagikan perasaannya di media sosial. Ia menulis, ""Terima kasih pada semua BLINK dan semua yang telah bergabung dengan kami untuk menyambut awal musim panas yang hangat! Tur Dunia DEADLINE Dimulai!! Kami kembali!"" Namun, yang benar-benar menyentuh hati semua orang adalah pesan spesialnya untuk para penggemar di seluruh dunia. Foto-foto yang dipublikasikannya adalah potret yang membuat penggemar bahagia, seperti  momen di panggung, foto candid di ruang ganti, dan foto-foto panggung epik yang membuat Anda ingin berada di sana. Dari gaun mini uniknya yang bertali hingga busana panggung yang anggun, Jisoo menampilkan penampilan yang sangat baik. Namun, yang paling tersorot publik adalah betapa tulusnya senyumannya di setiap foto. Hal ini membuat Anda benar-benar bisa merasakan kebahagiaan terpancar melalui layar."

我们俩点了一个Bone-in Prime Rib(32oz)，熟度为Medium，配了Truffled Scalloped Potato，甜品点了一份巧克力蛋糕。 首先值得一提的是，我以为这家店只是纯粹的价格贵，没想到它每道菜份量巨大……图片均是服务员均分给两个人后的一人份，我们两个人都得到了相当于平时意大利菜一份甜品的量。 建议大家要不找多点人一起吃，要不少点些，我们吃到最后撑/腻死了都没吃完
其次服务对得起价格，倒水小哥加水兢兢业业而且每次都满上[笑哭R]专门负责这桌的大哥随叫随到但不会烦你。 餐前用一套餐具，吃主菜用一套餐具，吃完后上甜品前再次收拾桌子&换叉子。 上主菜的场面隆重到让我们俩有点坐立不安：5+人在我们旁边支起小桌子，像做手术一样速度巨快地把我们的牛排和配菜平分成两份（我心笑：感谢你对女性的尊重但我绝对要再次转移给🧑🏻‍🦱）
Bone-in Prime Rib：应该算是招牌菜。 他不是那种常规的煎牛排，而是低温慢烤的，所以口感与其说像牛排，更像是烤/炖牛肉，非常软烂。 我们点的Medium，服务员说烤出来差不多就是这样了，图片比实际上看起来显得更红，但其实我们觉得刚刚好，感觉再熟就会柴了。 总而言之牛肉口感不错，肥瘦相间，尤其是骨头上的肉更是软糯，如果不是为了体面我恨不得抓起来直接啃[捂嘴笑R]不过缺点就是没有煎牛排那种爆汁的口感和香气，口味也比较淡，配的汁和酱也没有起什么作用[呃R]
Truffled Scalloped Potatl：土豆片培根芝士馅饼，有松露的香气，份量大但是好咸，也有点腻，🧑🏻‍🦱根本没吃几口，有点后悔[尬住R]
巧克力蛋糕：吃累了🈚️图，作为巧克力蛋糕他肯定算是很不错的，顶上一层脆香米丰富口感，蛋糕体非常湿润浓郁，配的草莓和果酱也非常解腻。 总结：这家在dt核心，坐拥芝加哥河景，服务态度巨好，虽然菜不能算顶级，但是体验芝加哥风情是一个不错的选择！ #芝加哥美食"

AIDAN'S FARM – MID-MORNING CARRIE arrives back at the farm in even higher heels than last time. She's dragging a soft pink weekender bag and wearing the gingham whale bonnet. She waves and starts down the narrow guesthouse stairs. A heel SNAPS. She lunges forward — arms windmilling — and lands squarely on: MATILDA, Aidan's beloved hen. The stiletto drives into MATILDA'S neck with surgical precision. Blood spatters across CARRIE'S bonnet and her Khaite Mallory maxi trench. WYATT, AIDAN, and KATHY watch as MATILDA bleeds out. WYATT screams. KATHY drops her travel mug. MATILDA convulses once. Then dies. Beat. AIDAN (quietly) You killed Matilda. CARRIE (looking at her heel, dazed) She ran into me. AIDAN (sobbing) We're done. He buys CARRIE a one-way Greyhound ticket to Port Authority — on her Amex. SCENE 25 – EXT. HANDSOME POND ROAD – LATER CARRIE waits four hours for the bus.

She pecks out the final sentences of The Woman on handmade 19th-century paper, fed through a restored Remington No. 2 typewriter. She's still wearing the blood-soaked bonnet. It's her Jackie Kennedy moment. Nearby, a bottle of Mexican Coke sweats gently on the windowsill. The keys click rhythmically. The light is golden. She types: “The woman understood that love isn't linear. It's a loop. Like a bonnet ribbon. Or a delivery route.” DOORBELL rings. MIRANDA ENTERS, breathless. MIRANDA What the hell happened? CARRIE (Not looking up) Not that you can grasp anything about my life, Miranda, but I completely understand Aidan's decision to dump me. (She points to the bonnet) I killed his prize hen.

mov_1AC0A931F3C2FC93F52212F7399E3B1A,2025-07-20 10:00:00,en,WEB,"  It has been a busy year for the luxury world. Arguably, it has been an even busier year for me. While I am still processing this life parenthesis, it is time to get this blog back on track. Indeed, I took the decision to carve more time to go back to what I like most: art and fashion. To start off this come back, I want to discuss the arrival of Jonathan Anderson at Dior. In early June, JWA was confirmed at the helm of one of my favorite luxury houses. This applies to both men and women. Kim Jones (formerly doing Dior Men) and Maria Grazia Chiuri (Women) will be missed, and I cannot wait for their future endeavors. Similarly, JWA will be dearly missed at Loewe which skyrocketed both culturally and commercially under his leadership. Let's see what the future holds for the Madrid Maison. Hôtel des Invalides, Courtesy Dior JWA is not new to the intersection of art and fashion. He collaborated with numerous contemporary artists while at Loewe: Lara Favaretto, Lynda Benglis or Anthea Hamilton are among my favorites. He gave them a stage. But this time, his approach is slightly different. At Loewe, Anderson had almost a cultural blank state in terms of references beyond the house codes. This was despite Loewe being the oldest fashion house of the LVMH group. But Dior comes with a rich history and cultural capital. A series of star designers before him have built on this. And in fact, the fashion, the communication, and the staging of the Men's show were about inspirations and references, not getting contemporary artists under the spotlight. « When I thought about how to expand the horizons of the Maison, I thought about Christian Dior, whom, after the Second World War, looked back to the past to create the New Look » said Anderson. Yet, the subversiveness of JWA's style transpires in the designs, showing his willingness to bridge tradition and modernity. Dior Men by Jonathan Anderson, Courtesy Numéro Magazine The fashion is where this tension is the most prominent. The Dior Delft dress and its folds inspired a wide androgynous pair of shorts. The collars on straight shirts were purposely crooked while perfectly ironed. Ties were mixed with Canadian tuxedos. Delicate flowers adorned heavy Irish-inspired knits. Bows and jellyfish-leather shoes flirted and traditional tailcoats cohabited with chunky sneakers. Soft pinks and grey hues, among Mr. Dior's signature colors, sprinkled the looks through the show. References to traditional inspirations went beyond the house of Dior with tote bags referencing Dracula by Bram Stocker (1897), Les Liaisons dangereuses by Pierre Choderlos de Laclos (1782), Bonjour tristesse by Françoise Sagan (1954) and a sentence Dior by Dior. Maybe a wink at the storytelling abilities of a designer who was as much of an artist as a publicist. Jean-Michel Basquiat by Andy Warhol, 1982, © Estate of Jean-Michel Basquiat.

Lee Radziwill by Andy Warhol, 1972, © ANDY WARHOL – LA FONDATION ANDY WARHOL POUR LES ARTS VISUELS – COURTESY OF HEATHER JAMES FINE ART The totes were also among the first communication assets shared by Dior on social media. They encapsulate this dance between conceited tradition and unstructured modernity. Established as a Maison icon under Maria Grazia Chiuri, the recent success of the piece is anchored in time with references from before its creation. Similarly, the pictures of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Lee Radziwill by Andy Warhol for the first campaign, embody this challenge of bridging worlds. « Wearing Dior is being stylish. That is why I chose portraits of Jean-Michel Basquiat and Lee Radziwill. They do not have anything in common, came from completely different backgrounds. But they had style. » Finally, the location and setup of the show was expertly crafted. It played on the weight of traditional references at the brink of being challenged and remodeled. The venue was staged in front of the Invalides, a symbol of French military. It displayed a large replica of Dior's Salon Avenue Montaigne where all of Dior's shows took place. The cultural simulacrum was reinforced as guests entered the venue. The walls were adorned in grey velvet and golden wooden floor. This setup replicated a room from the Gemäldegalerie of Berlin known for best enhancing the colors of the paintings.

The works were still lives from Jean Siméon Chardin (1699-1779). One of them, Le Panier de fraises, was borrowed from the Louvre (of which LVMH is a sponsor)...."

The scent we choose says something personal and intimate. It lingers in memory, marks special moments, and even builds our identity. This is why perfume continues to play such a powerful role in people's everyday lives. The Emotional Connection to Fragrance Fragrance triggers emotion like few other things can. A single scent can transport someone back to childhood, a romantic evening, or a joyful celebration. This deep emotional tie makes perfume more than fashion—it becomes part of life's soundtrack, leaving invisible traces of memories behind wherever we go. The Enduring Power of Signature Scents Many people become known for their signature scent. Friends and loved ones begin to associate them with a particular fragrance. This habit creates continuity, giving a sense of identity that's comforting and recognizable. Signature scents often become extensions of the wearer, chosen carefully to represent mood, personality, and style. Designer Perfumes That Dominate Shelves Major designers continue to shape the fragrance world. Scents like Chanel's Coco Mademoiselle, Dior's J'adore, and Yves Saint Laurent's Mon Paris remain favorites. These perfumes combine art and luxury, offering something timeless. Their popularity proves how carefully crafted scents can transcend time and speak to multiple generations of wearers. Why Celebrity Perfumes Still Sell Celebrity perfumes bring fame and fragrance together. Pop stars and actors create scents that reflect their image and connect with fans. Ariana Grande, Rihanna, and Sarah Jessica Parker have all released successful perfumes. These products allow people to feel closer to someone they admire while also discovering scents that suit them. Scent and Season: Finding the Right Fit Different seasons call for different fragrances. Fresh, airy florals and citrus blends are perfect for spring and summer, offering lightness and energy. Autumn and winter invite deeper, spicier notes like amber, musk, and vanilla. Matching a perfume to the weather helps amplify its beauty and wearability throughout the year. The Quiet Rise of Niche Fragrances Niche perfume houses offer a more artistic approach. With small batches and unique ingredients, brands like Le Labo and Byredo appeal to those seeking individuality. These perfumes don't follow mainstream trends, which makes them feel special. They speak to people who want to wear something no one else has discovered. Bolagila and the Modern Perfume Landscape Among the growing crowd of new perfume houses, Bolagila stands out for its clean lines and elegant scents. With a focus on simplicity, balance, and refinement, Bolagila caters to those who appreciate modern luxury without excessive complexity. The brand captures a contemporary vision of elegance through its thoughtful fragrance compositions.

Melody 被身邊工作人員突襲拍攝家中日常，沒想到三大櫃的精品包牆意外曝光，讓人忍不住驚呼她真的是資深包控！ 其中一區更是滿滿的愛馬仕橘盒堆疊如牆，讓人瞬間理解她口中「不是失心瘋，是多年收藏」這句話的分量。 當鏡頭掃過她的小包收藏時，Melody 邊笑邊喊：「真的還好啦！」 甚至還一度躲進櫃子裡避難，笑翻網友。 CHANEL 2.55包
Melody 拿出CHANEL 2.55 經典包，輕描淡寫地說：「這個應該可以吧？」 她形容這款包不但漂亮又耐看，更是一個能抵抗通膨的時尚投資品，女兒則淡定回應：「It's nice.」雖然評語平實，但從表情就知道，這包已經被悄悄放進心願清單！ 雲朵包、The Row、康康包…女兒也點名
Melody 還分享大女兒主動點名的包款，Bottega Veneta 的 POUCH 雲朵包，她特別保存全新版本，只等女兒長大來繼承。 而由「富貴花們」送的 THE ROW 水桶包，她也愛不釋手。 說到愛馬仕經典的康康包，她表示：「那時候我很喜歡，H 是法郎的，白色、酒紅、黑色都有！」 典藏色讓人驚艷。 柏金、Peekaboo、Loom 都是溫柔實用派
提到收藏中的大咖，Melody 當然也少不了愛馬仕柏金包。 她坦言以前年輕追求大包，30、35cm 的尺寸是當時流行，但現在則因為太重而少背。 反倒是像 FENDI 的 Peekaboo 她會定期檢查保養，特別喜歡它的溫柔色調。 而 Loro Piana 的 Loom 包則是她最近最滿意的選品，帆布與小牛皮的對比搭配，精緻又輕盈。 女兒點頭的 DIOR 30 Montaigne
最後一款讓女兒點頭稱讚的是 DIOR 的 30 Montaigne 白色配金扣包款，經典百搭又有現代感，Melody 滿足地表示：「大女兒應該也是蠻滿意的。」 從收藏到傳承，Melody 不僅展現了她的時尚品味，也默默為女兒準備好一整座精品寶藏牆！ 圖片來源：小紅書

mov_2B9B7A85FC20F32BFF32228A2AB64ED3,2025-07-21 03:34:46,en,WEB,"  Zepto co-founder Aadit Palicha last week announced the 10-minute delivery for luxury cosmetic brands-- Estée Lauder's M.A.C., The Ordinary and Clinique--on the platform. From discounted offerings to previously elusive luxury and global brands, e-commerce and quick commerce platforms are witnessing a multifold surge in beauty and skincare product sales amid soaring demand. In fact, capitalizing on this trend, Zepto co-founder Aadit Palicha last week announced the 10-minute delivery for luxury cosmetic brands-- Estée Lauder's M.A.C., The Ordinary and Clinique--on the platform. After observing a surge in demand for existing beauty brands like Maybelline, Lakmé, and Faces Canada, Mamaearth, Renee, Swiss Beauty, and SUGAR Cosmetics, Zepto decided to expand its portfolio by including luxury brands as well, to offer users a wider range of options, said Devendra Meel, Chief Business Officer at Zepto. According to a report by Bengaluru-based consultancy firm Redseer, India's beauty industry is expected to reach $34 billion by 2028, driven by rising disposable incomes, increased consumer aspirations, and the influence of social media and e-commerce. Highlighting changing consumer behaviour, Amazon Beauty, Director Siddharth Bhagat told Storyboard18 about a strong shift towards tech-enabled, trend-led and personalised experiences for the cosmetics and skincare products. He said that faster deliveries, influencer-driven discovery, and the rise of D2C and international brands are further fueling the momentum. ""Amazon has witnessed a 12x growth in cosmetics due to the recent success of newly launched brands in 2025,"" Bhagat added. Nykaa, the pioneer in building a beauty-centric digital commerce platform, said its beauty business has grown 25 percent on a year-on-year basis, recording a revenue of Rs 7,251 crore for fiscal year 2025. Nykaa's beauty vertical includes e-commerce, physical retail, its house of brands, as well as an eB2B business. Nykaa's closest competitor, Myntra, has also ramped up its beauty segment on the platform to capitalise on the demand. Deepak Joshi, Senior Director - Category Management, Beauty and Personal Care, Myntra said the platform's dedicated 'Beauty' segment has outpaced the online beauty market by two-fold, registering more than 50 percent consistent year-on-year increase in monthly active users. ""Currently, Myntra Beauty boasts more than 2,900 brands,"" Joshi added. 'Tier-2 demand surge' Industry experts have acknowledged that tier-2 cities have emerged as a crucial market for platforms, driving demand for both affordable and premium cosmetics and skincare products. Meel from Zepto said that while quick commerce has largely remained metro-centric, traction for beauty products has notably increased in Tier-2 cities as well. Myntra's Joshi also noted that nearly half of the beauty buyers on the platform come from tier-2 and tier-3 cities. Besides, He also mentioned that Myntra's quick commerce service, M-Now, witnessed a 1.4x spike in demand for beauty products on Mother's Day in 2025. Notably, Vishal Chaturvedi, Vice President, The Body Shop, Asia South, said that quick commerce has delivered exceptional results for the company, almost doubling its growth compared to last year. ""Our specially curated selection of packed gift boxes and mini packs has seen strong sales on the quick commerce platform,"" Chaturvedi said. 'Rise of K-Beauty' In the competitive beauty market, digital commerce platforms have expanded their portfolio by adding luxury and premium beauty offerings, particularly Korean beauty (K-beauty) brands. According to the Amazon spokesperson, the K-Beauty category on the platform has witnessed a 75 percent year-on-year growth. According to Bhagat, K-beauty products primarily resonates with urban and digital-savvy women, aged between 20 and 35 years. ""The urban women have embraced K-beauty products to a larger extent, especially from cities like Bengaluru, Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Pune"". Moreover, women from tier-2 cities are also exploring the K-beauty products through trial SKUs like sheet masks and minis, he added. Bucking the trend, Bhagat said Amazon has observed that a rising cohort of male consumers are also experimenting with Korean skincare, particularly around functional solutions like cleansers, serums, and sunscreens. A range of K-beauty brands have entered into Indian market via digital commerce platforms, such as COSRX, Laneige, and Beauty of Joseon, TIRTIR, Medicube, and Skin1004. Meanwhile, Myntra said that they have witnessed a 150 percent YoY growth in K-beauty category. Beyond K-beauty, several international luxury beauty brands are also capturing Indian consumers' attention through digital channels. Nykaa has a dedicated segment, called Nykaa Luxe, which offers a wide range of cosmetics and skincare products from luxury brands such as Armani beauty, Chanel, L'Oréal Luxe, Eucerin, Dior, Tom Ford, sol de janerio, among others. The company noted that the average annual spend by its top 10% customers is $395 on premium beauty products. Following suit, other platforms like Tira and Tata CliQ have also expanded their beauty portfolios. Myntra's quick commerce venture also offers a selection of international and premium beauty brands, including YSL and Estee Lauder. A report by global consultancy firm Kearney underscored that the luxury beauty accounts for about 4 percent share of the overall beauty and personal care market. In contrast, developing Asian peers, such as Thailand, Vietnam, and Malaysia, see luxury beauty holding a 20-25 market share. However, when it comes luxury beauty market, offline stores have outpace online platforms, according to Kearney. The firm said that 70 percent of luxury beauty sales came from the offline channel in the past year. ""Specialty stores, with beauty-focused multi-brand retailers such as Sephora and Nykaa, contribute to 25 percent of the luxury beauty market, followed by boutiques or standalone brand stores, such as MAC, Forest Essentials, and Dior, with 20 percent of the market,"" the report added."
