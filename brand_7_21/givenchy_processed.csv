mov_D0B92F8FAF1CDDEFA7165705DDD75DB3,2025-07-14 14:53:13,en,WEB,"  Princess Charlotte made her third Wimbledon appearance this weekend, alongside Prince William and Princess Kate. Her outfit especially stood out: a white frilled dress with black piping, which subtly matched a look worn by her mother in 2022. But this was not just a case of twinning; the outfit was a carefully styled nod to Kate's past wardrobe, her designer relationships, and even Charlotte's own personality. From the bespoke dress to her silver charm bracelet, nearly every detail of Charlotte's ensemble carried a deeper reference or sentimental value. Custom dress with Royal history Charlotte's white summer dress was custom-made by Sarah Burton, the designer responsible for Kate's 2011 wedding gown. It featured soft frill detailing at the hem and precise black V-line stitching. These are design elements closely resembling a certain white Emilia Wickstead dress Kate wore at the Guards Polo Club in 2022. Burton, now at Givenchy, also dressed Kate in a dark red gown at a State Banquet earlier this month. Her recent involvement with both royals hints at a growing fashion mentorship between Kate and her daughter. For footwear and accessories, Charlotte wore Camilla Elphick flats and Finlay & Co sunglasses, another overlap with Kate's past Wimbledon appearances. Charm bracelet with personal touches Charlotte's silver Pandora bracelet added more clues. One charm was set with a green stone—her May birthstone—while another was a miniature Nala from The Lion King, possibly referencing her known love for animated films. The third charm was a silver heart paired with an engraved disk. Though the inscription wasn't readable, it appeared to be custom-made. The disk likely contains a message from or about someone close to her, given that Pandora's official listings state that the charm is meant for a “personal stamp” or “message for someone special.” ALSO READ: IN PICS: Preity Zinta and Gene Goodenough enjoy Wimbledon date, Sara Tendulkar has a fun day with family"

Princess Charlotte reportedly wore a bespoke piece by her mom, the Princess of Wales' wedding dress designer to Wimbledon on Sunday. According to the MailOnline, the 10 year old's white dress with navy-trimmed ruffles on the bodice was designed by Sarah Burton for Givenchy. © Andrew Matthews - WPA Pool/ Sarah, who left Alexander McQueen in 2023, was behind the iconic wedding dress that the Princess of Wales wore to marry Prince William at Westminster Abbey in 2011. On the day of the royal wedding, the palace shared that the bride had chosen the ""British brand Alexander McQueen for the beauty of its craftsmanship and its respect for traditional workmanship and the technical construction of clothing,"" and that she ""wished for her dress to combine tradition and modernity with the artistic vision that characterises Alexander McQueen's work."" © Adam Davy/PA Images via You may also like Catherine is said to have worked closely with Sarah in formulating the design of her wedding dress. The palace noted then that the stunning gown epitomized ""timeless British craftsmanship by drawing together talented and skilled workmanship from across the United Kingdom"" and paid ""tribute to the Arts and Crafts tradition, which advocated truth to materials and traditional craftsmanship using simple forms and often Romantic styles of decoration,"" adding that Sarah's design drew ""on this heritage, additionally giving the cut and the intricate embellishment a distinctive, contemporary and feminine character."" © Samir Hussein/WireImage Sarah was appointed creative director of Givenchy in September of 2024. “It is a great honour to be joining the beautiful house of Givenchy, it is a jewel,"" the designer said in a statement at the time. "" I am so excited to be able to write the next chapter in the story of this iconic house and to bring to Givenchy my own vision, sensibility and beliefs.” Charlotte completed her Wimbledon dress by Sarah on July 13 with white Mary Jane flats, a Pandora charm bracelet, pink nail polish and her hair styled half up in braids with a navy bow. Days before her daughter stepped out in Givenchy, the Princess of Wales herself stunned in a design from the French fashion house. © Chris Jackson/ Her Royal Highness looked regal on July 8 wearing a dark red evening gown by Sarah for Givenchy that featured a caped back detailing—teamed with the Lover's Knot Tiara—to a state banquet hosted by King Charles and Queen Camilla for French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, First Lady Brigitte Macron, during their state visit to the UK.

mov_3669BA82B1B3CD13C135502499F3F431,2025-07-15 06:00:49,en,WEB,"  LVMH shareholders have endured a torrid 2025 so far, with the French luxury group's stock market value sinking by a quarter over the last six months. The group, which counts Louis Vuitton, Dior and Givenchy among its stable of fashion brands, has seen shares sink by almost a third over the last 12 months as the global luxury rebound has probed sluggish. Last week Louis Vuitton announced it was targeted by a cyberattack for the third time in the past three months at the beginning of July, after Marks & Spencer, the Co-op and Harrods were all targeted earlier this year. Meanwhile, LVMH's drinks division, Moët Hennessy, is being gripped by a €1.3million court case brought by Maria Gasparovic, former chief of staff to executive Jean-Marc Lacave, who was sacked four months after reporting alleged sexual misconduct by senior colleagues. Despite these recent tribulations for the firm, analysts think shares could be due a rebound. LVMH revenues contracted 3 per cent to €20.3billion in the first quarter, from €20.7billion a year ago, well below analyst forecasts for sales growth of 2 per cent. Revenue in the firm's wines and spirits division, headed up by its Moët and Hennessy brands, declined 9 per cent to €1.3billion. Its largest category, fashion and leather goods, saw sales fall 5 per cent to €10.1billion, from €10.5billion previously. The firm, which was the first in its sector to post figures after the Donald Trump's 'liberation day' tariff announcements, said: 'In a disrupted geopolitical and economic environment, LVMH remains both vigilant and confident at the start of the year.' The French firm, which has a market capitalisation of almost €250billion, owns 75 luxury brands. It will publish its results for the first half of its 2025 financial year on 24 July. It isn't just LVMH that is feeling the pinch, the entire luxury sector is facing a similar downturn. After a post-pandemic peak that saw luxury brands surge on the back of huge demand, external pressures such as geopolitical uncertainty and economic slowdown have precipitated a downturn across the sector. During the course of 2024, the market dipped from €369billion to €364billion, according to figures from Bain & Company, with weaker demand, especially from China and the US, pushing the shrink. American luxury demand was down around 10 per cent in 2024 compared to its peak in 2022, according to data from Morningstar, while Chinese demand has slipped a quarter in compared with its pre-pandemic high point. Even so, LVMH has suffered a worse fate than many, with the firm underperforming luxury peers. Morningstar analysts said LVMH is currently trading below the broker's value estimate of €620 per share. At midday on Thursday, LVMH shares were trading at €496.05 per share. Since January, LVMH shares have fallen some 34 per cent, and was surpassed in value by Hermes, which became the largest luxury goods firm in April. Morningstar says this is a normalisation after the post pandemic boom, during which the firm said LVMH's valuation was stretched. At the time, LVMH was operating on a price to earnings ratio of 26. Now, having seen its share price half, its PE ratio on a one year rolling basis now stands at 20.2, according to figures form Stockopedia. In comparison, the new king of luxury, Hermes, is operating on a PE ratio of 50.8. Likewise, a number of other luxury goods firms have significantly larger PE ratios than LVMH, with Burberry standing at 48.2, EssilorLuxotica at 33.1 and Kering at 26.7. Jelena Sokolova, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said: 'We have seen luxury sector slowdowns many times before, but this time LVMH's valuation has been unfairly hit. 'The retailer is trading at its lowest forward earnings multiple in seven years and roughly half that of comparable wide-moat peers, which presents an opportunity for investors.' Morningstar added: 'Forward earnings multiples are at the lowest for the last seven years and are meaningfully below peers, offering around 30 per cent upside to our fair value estimate.' However, others argue that LVMH's downturn is far from an unfair reflection on the rest of the business. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, however, told This is Money: 'LVMH has lost its sparkle after a series of setbacks in recent years. It has focused too much on the aspirational market and these types of buyers have become more cash-conscious, watching their pennies rather than opening their wallets without a care in the world. 'In contrast, Hermes has explicitly focused on the ultra-rich and has enjoyed more resilient trading. LVMH might now be thinking hard about narrowing its customer focus as that could help to make its products more desirable, which is ultimately what luxury goods is all about.' LVMH still has exceptional brand strength, which Morningstar says will give it the edge against its peers. The group's brands making up 29 per cent of the luxury leather market, compared to just 8 per cent for Hermes. The firm's impressive storefronts and higher capital spending on retail may help its brands to stand out from their competition. The strength of the brand remains, with LVMH having seen fashion and leather sales grow slightly better than the wider sector last year, though this dipped in the first quarter of 2025. Coatsworth, however, said: 'LVMH has too many different interests. We're in an environment where companies are focusing on what they do best and jettisoning non-core assets. LVMH would be better if it just focused on fashion and got rid of the Sephora and DFS retail arms and its various food and drink operations.' LVMH's brand strength, unwieldy though it may be, could combine with the potential for an upswing in the sector after the slowdown of the past few years. Morningstar's Sokolova certainly thinks this is the case. She told This is Money: 'We expect the luxury industry to return to growth after the current - and last year's - slowdown, driven by normalisation of demand in the US as post-pandemic excess spending is flushed out - a trend we've seen since 2023 - and as Chinese real estate prices stabilize, boosting consumer sentiment. ' LVMH derives around 24 per cent of its sales from the US, where consumer sending has also stalled. Morningstar said: 'We estimate that post-pandemic excesses have been flushed out of the market, US luxury consumption should come back to growth from more normal levels. We expect US GDP to hold up stronger in the long term.' China accounts for a significant portion of LVMH's sales, with Asia (excluding Japan), accounting for 30 per cent of LVMH sales. China's economy is currently in a period of slow growth, with consumers remaining tight on spending. In the first quarter, LVMH revenue from China fell by 11 per cent, with the second quarter expected to follow suit. Sokolova said: 'Many Chinese spenders are still sitting on substantial savings following the pandemic. We expect LVMH to outperform the industry growth longer-term thanks to strength of the brands and substantial marketing budget...."

I wish they leaned more into this type of royal-flexing. Imagine a 10 year old casually wearing a custom dress by the head of Givenchy, for the mens singles final at Wimbledon, where her Mom is (royal) Patron. I love stories where the richie rich are like, I really wanted a tshirt, and so Calvin/Tommy made me one in every colour (this is a made up story btw). Or like Jane Birkin, where she complained to the Hermes guy on a first class about their bags not being big enough 😂."

Here's a look at the key elements that made her an icon- the fashion choices, the impactful roles in cinema, and more. Fashion impact 'Breakfast at Tiffany's' and fashion influence Hepburn's role in Breakfast at Tiffany's cemented her status as a fashion icon. The black dress she donned became synonymous with timeless elegance. Her association with designer Hubert de Givenchy set the trends that are still admired today. Hepburn's style was all about simplicity and sophistication, influencing countless fashion enthusiasts and designers across the globe. Humanitarian efforts Humanitarian work beyond Hollywood Beyond acting, Hepburn devoted much of her life to humanitarian work. As a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, she traveled extensively to raise awareness about children's issues in developing countries. Her commitment to helping others added depth to her public persona and endeared her further to audiences who admired not just her talent but also her compassion. Cinematic legacy Memorable roles that defined an era Hepburn has starred in many films that left an indelible mark on American cinema. Movies like Roman Holiday (for which she won an Academy Award) showcased her versatility as an actor. Her ability to portray both comedic and dramatic roles with equal finesse made each performance memorable, contributing significantly to the cultural landscape of Hollywood during that era. Personal style Timeless appeal through personal style Hepburn's style went beyond film sets and into real life. Famous for minimalistic yet chic outfits, she made looks like cropped pants and ballet flats or simple turtlenecks and tailored trousers iconic. These styles are still emulated by those seeking classic elegance without excess embellishment or complexity."

The by-appointment space created by interior designer Augusta Hoffman offers privacy and a harmonious neutral palette to give brides a slow-paced environment in which to view the craftsmanship and details of ready-to-wear or custom gowns. Vintage furniture is locally sourced, as is the art. Visitors will get a first look at the boned bodices and hand-painted silks of Frankel's latest Collection X, inspired by Russian-French artist Erté. Layered designs in silk wool twill, linen organza, crinkle chiffon, and tulle all add to the elegant theatricality of the looks on view. 8475 Melrose Pl., L.A., 323-533-7241; daniellefrankelstudio.com . E.V. Cult Gaia Gets Hitched CULT GAIA , the L.A.-based brand responsible for striking social media gold with its vintage-inspired accessories and cutout dresses, has entered the bridal space with a collection of everything from a strapless silk gown with ostrich feather accents to a column dress with raffia fringe to a pearlized acrylic clutch. “Each piece is thoughtfully created to captivate, inspire, and evoke pure emotion on your most special days,” says founder Jasmin Larian Hekmat, adding that her goal was to offer a range of looks that can be worn time and time again. Other standouts include a a crown adorned with delicate silk flowers — a full-circle moment for the brand, which began with flower crowns as its initial product category. cultgaia.com . C.C. Talula Dempsey's Tempting Sweets What began as a cupcake project for an event at Talula Dempsey's sorority at George Washington University quickly grew into a small-scale catering operation out of her Malibu home called TALULA'S KITCHEN . Dempsey sought out advice from her parents, actor Patrick Dempsey and makeup artist Jillian Dempsey: “[They always said] the best way to gain experience is to go out and do the actual job, so I did and never looked back,” she says. Friends began putting in shipping requests for her chocolate chip cookies, so she formulated a mix with step-by-step instructions before finding herself catering larger events. Among her most requested items for wedding receptions is a spread of both large and individual-size pastries, such as cinnamon swirl brioches, cupcakes, and her famous organic mixed-berry crumble. talulaskitchen.com . C.C. Zoë de Givenchy Devises A Perfect Pairing Melbourne-born founder and creative director of luxury brand Z.d.G., ZOË DE GIVENCHY , dreams up the most exquisite pieces, and her new table collection, NÉNUPHAR , a collaboration with American ready-to-wear designer ADAM LIPPES , is no different. The selection includes lace-like charger plates, hand-painted dinner plates, French silver, and hand-embroidered linens from France and jacquards from Italy. The launch also marks de Givenchy's foray into glassware with wine tumblers and bowls hand painted in Austria by the famed glassmaker Lobmeyr. The delicate wedding-appropriate designs are informed by 18th-century Japanese obi jacquards featuring trailing white jasmine and water lilies. “[Adam's] clean aesthetic, American ease and eye for beauty, feels at home alongside my own,” she says. Sounds like an ideal marriage. zdgofficial.com ; adamlippes.com . C.C. Merlette's Shore Thing In 2016, Australian-born designer Marina Cortbawi launched her Brooklyn-based atelier MERLETTE intending to refine shapes and textures, creating “a sense of empowered femininity” through airy, elegant designs. Nearly a decade later, she opened her first brick-and-mortar shop in Montecito, and now she's launched a Spring/Summer bridal capsule showcasing laid-back, understated dresses, some of which are designed using existing silhouettes reworked in ivory or white. The collection includes dresses that are versatile enough for a chill beachside ceremony or an elegant rehearsal dinner.

Celebratory Florals Take on a Green Hue Fresh florals are one of the most defining elements of wedding day design, and many brides are gravitating toward more herbaceous, green-heavy compositions. “I have been seeing brides embrace the use of green or greenery as a primary element in their design rather than an accent to it, which has been really fun for me,” says SoCal floral designer JENN SANCHEZ , who pulls from her own garden, abandoned fields, or farmers' markets for edible accompaniments to centerpieces...."
mov_C80B78691005640E32368BB7B77ABC7E,2025-07-16 19:19:30,en,WEB,"  Meryll Rogge takes over at Marni, halting a backward trend. In the latest move in the unprecedented realignment of the fashion world, Meryll Rogge was appointed creative director of Marni on Tuesday. She will be responsible for women's wear, men's wear, accessories, store design and communications, replacing Francesco Risso, who left the Italian brand last month after almost 10 years. Ms. Rogge is the 17th new designer named to a big brand since mid-2024, but only the fourth woman. It's a striking imbalance in an industry that is still largely powered by women's wear and accessories, and one that was quick to pay lip service to diversity in recent years but has seemed to retreat from many of its pledges in terms of gender and race. Ms. Rogge will become the sole female designer in the stable of OTB, the holding company that also owns Maison Margiela, Jil Sander, Diesel and Viktor & Rolf and that reported sales of 1.7 billion euros in 2024, down 4 percent from 2023. Similarly, Louise Trotter, who will make her debut at Bottega Veneta in September, is the only female fashion designer at Kering, the luxury group that owns Gucci, Balenciaga and Saint Laurent, among other brands. The other two women who became creative directors of major fashion houses this year are Sarah Burton at Givenchy and Veronica Leoni at Calvin Klein. In a news release, Stefano Rosso, the Marni chief executive, called Ms. Rogge ""an exceptional creative talent and an inspiring woman."" A Belgian designer who started her career at Marc Jacobs before becoming head of women's design at Dries Van Noten and founding a namesake brand in 2020, Ms. Rogge, 40, shares a certain quirky practicality with Marni's founder, Consuelo Castiglioni. It was Ms. Castiglioni who transformed her husband's family fur company into a runway name beloved of bohemian intellectuals and art gallerists with a messy bent. In 2012, OTB bought a majority stake in the company, acquiring it fully in 2015. The next year, Ms. Castiglioni left, citing personal reasons, and Mr. Risso was named creative director. Though Mr. Risso's collections could be eye-poppingly imaginative, bristling with three-dimensional metal flowers or covered in what looked like finger paint, they could also seem self-indulgent - fun to look at but hard to wear. Ms. Rogge, who is relatively unknown outside the fashion world, became the first woman to be named designer of the year at the Belgian Fashion Awards in 2024 and was the recipient of the Andam Prize earlier this year, one of fashion's most prestigious awards. In explaining the selection, Guillaume Houzé, the president of Andam, cited Ms. Rogge's ability to turn ""ambiguity, hybridity and the unexpected into allies."" Like Ms. Castiglioni, she is also adept at marrying the conceptual to the commercial and has an affinity for color and the sort of print combinations that are alluring in their oddity. In the news release, Ms. Rogge called joining Marni ""both humbling and inspiring."" A spokeswoman for Marni did not specify when Ms. Rogge would unveil her first collection. She did say, however, that the designer planned to maintain her own line and split her time between the two brands. Multitasking, as it were."

44DF2738300840B12C56DCAB4CD23D30,2025-07-17 07:21:55,en,PRINT,"  Appearances at Wimbledon and a French state visit symbolize a new kind of style. Earlier this year, when Catherine, the Princess of Wales, returned to the public eye after her treatment for cancer, The Sunday Times of London reported that she was doing so with a caveat: She wanted to focus on her work, not her clothes. Her office would no longer share information about what she wore. Cue shock and horror. Even if it was understandable, given what she had been through, and even if the report was later disputed by the palace itself, it sent tremors through the fashion-watching community. That was partly because the princess could change the fortunes of a designer or a brand simply by wearing a dress. And it was partly because she had long used her place in the attention economy to shine a light not just on British products, but on issues like sustainability by remaking and rewearing pieces from her closet, and even renting the occasional evening gown. Mostly, though, it was because the clothes are an expression of her role as a symbol -- of the country and that fine line between continuity and modernization. Stepping back from one suggested she was stepping back from the other. It's a weird thing to essentially be an avatar, but it's the job. As her appearance at the Wimbledon men's and women's finals, and at the French state visit, demonstrated, however, Catherine may be more selective about her appearances (she did skip Ascot), but she is no less strategic. She is simply being Catherine 3.0. There she was, after all, at the state visit, welcoming Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron in a blush-colored Dior suit with a New Look jacket and a skirt covered in net, just brushing her calves. The brand is both classic French and about to be led by a designer from Northern Ireland who was trained in Britain. It was a considered nod to political alliance (the kind she has practiced since marrying Prince William) that she repeated at the French state banquet, wearing a red Givenchy gown with a built-in cape sweeping down from her shoulders. It was regal, sure, but also strategic, given that Givenchy is now designed by Sarah Burton, the British designer who made Catherine's wedding gown and who has been her collaborator on numerous high-profile public occasions. Talk about entente. And there Catherine was at the Wimbledon women's final in a cream jacket and long pleated skirt, a coolly appropriate riff on tennis whites and her position as patron of the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club. So, too, the royal blue ankle-length Roksanda dress she wore to the men's final was perfectly coordinated with Prince William's blue blazer, Prince George's blue suit and Princess Charlotte's white dress trimmed in blue, all creating a literal picture of family unity. All demonstrating that Catherine is as attuned as ever to the role image-making plays in her job. That's not new. What is new, however, is the style in which she is doing it, and its consistency. Her skirts have gotten longer, her jackets more tailored, her silhouette more streamlined. The effect of dropping her hemlines even a few inches is both oddly nostalgic and sophisticated, gently protective. A reminder that she is dressing for the long game. Like the lanky pantsuits she had adopted for her everyday appearances, her style is shaping up as a new formula for dressing. As recognizable, in its own way, as the monochrome formula that served Queen Elizabeth II so well: shoes-to-coat-to-dress-to-hat in one shade. And it brings a new dimension to the symbolism inherent in Catherine's role. She is representing not just the next generation of the royal family, which itself represents tradition. She is representing the idea of elegance emerging from adversity, an idea that has both micro and macro associations. Who couldn't use some of that right about now?"
n3m9keg,2025-07-17 12:19:09,en,REDDIT,"  The Celine luggage is pretty but I've seen soooo many second hand really roughed up and it seems like some of them don't really have the best leather/are easily scuffed? Can't say anything about Fendi or Givenchy, but can vouch for the leather and durability of Mulberry. I've got some myself and they just look better and better - especially my Bayswater and Alexa. Next on my wish list, the Islington!"
n3mgz1t,2025-07-17 13:01:31,en,REDDIT,"  Celine! I had a very similar line-up when pulling the trigger. I found it a bit tricky to take things out of Givenchy - it was so stiff and awkward (even though I still drool over her, she is so pretty), and Mullberry... Alexa with black hardware - I say yes in a heartbeat, but this one isn't their most convenient and usable model (in my opinion). Celine is just so, so cool."
n3mtvmv,2025-07-17 14:08:21,en,REDDIT,"  I own both Mulberry and Céline. (And yes I put the accent on because it was there when Phoebe Philo designed the bag.) Some people think the Luggage is dated, but I think it will make a comeback based on the latest collection. You cannot go wrong with Mulberry, but it's not in the same tier of luxury as the other brands (again, I'm saying this as someone who just pulled her phone out of her Mulberry bag and the price point makes that obvious so I'm not shading the brand at all. That being said I'd consider getting one of their permanent collection bags (Lily, Bayswater, Alexa) if any of them are of interest vs. one of the more seasonal styles. I would actually go with the Givenchy if you can find one in good condition. The shape is incredible and it can carry a lot."

mov_BD15E6AF2E178969D175ED8CC1B4640F,2025-07-19 02:41:10,en,WEB,"  KENT, OH. - The Kent State University Museum presents its summer exhibition titled Sparkle: The Style and Jewelry of Aileen Mehle. In honor of the Kent State University Museums 40th anniversary, this exhibition pays tribute to Aileen Mehle, a friend of the museum founders and widely syndicated society columnist. The exhibition features evening dresses and jewelry from Mehle that is being displayed in the museums historic Higbee Gallery from July 18, 2025, through Aug. 23, 2026. Aileen Mehle had so much taste and enthusiasm that it is fitting to pay tribute to her as we celebrate 40 years of the Kent State University Museum, stated Kent State University Museum Curator Sara Hume, Ph.D. Her career as a journalist attests to her brilliant wit and driving work ethic, yet she took extraordinary care in presenting herself appropriately for the variety of social occasions she reported on. She is an underappreciated style icon who is finally getting her due. Mehle, who lived from 1918 to 2016, wrote under the pseudonym Suzy Knickerbocker and enjoyed a career spanning five decades from the 1950s until her final column in 2005, which she wrote at the age of 87. This exhibition celebrates the sparkle of her style and the sparkle of her wit, Hume said. Mehle dressed in Pauline Trigère, Oscar de la Renta, Geoffrey Beene, Yves Saint Laurent and Givenchy while wearing jewelry by David Webb, Cartier and Tiffany & Co. as well as bags by Judith Leiber and Bulgari. The exhibition features nearly two dozen vintage David Webb pieces. Aileen Mehle was the consummate David Webb collector: a self-assured woman of style who purchased countless treasures for herself and gave bejeweled gifts to her friends, noted Levi Higgs, David Webbs head of archives and brand heritage. Her records tell the story of a gregarious woman-about-town with impeccable taste and who embodied a bold and courageous sense of self-expression. Aileen Mehle was known for accessorizing her glamorous evening looks with dazzling statement jewelry, said Kent State University Museum Collections Manager/Registrar Joanne Fenn, who co-curated the exhibition with Hume. We are thrilled to debut her exceptional collection featuring work from influential jewelry designers such as Jean Schlumberger, Paloma Picasso, Bulgari and more. This exhibition promises to both inspire and engage students, offering a rare glimpse into the artistry and craftsmanship of these iconic creators. In an era before everyone could turn to social media to discover who was going where or who was seeing whom, Suzy, as Aileen Mehle was known to her devoted fans, kept us all abreast of the comings and goings as well as the juicy scandals of New Yorks social set, said Armand Limnander, executive editor of W. Her dazzling jewelry and clothing collection is testament to the time in which she lived and the world she inhabited. Among the approximately 20 dresses from the 1960s through the 1990s mounted in the exhibition is the beaded dress by Nilo de Paul that she wore to Truman Capotes Black and White Ball in 1966 alongside a selection of her jewelry that range from vintage earrings from the 1930s to statement necklaces and bracelets from the 1980s. Aileen aka Suzy moved in rarefied circles, or should I say, rarefied circles moved around Aileen. She was, in the years she wrote for WWD, almost always bedecked in frills and froth, sometimes with a boa wrapped around her, said James Fallon, chief content officer of Fairchild Media Group and WWD. But those soft outfits covered a steely reporter whose eyes never missed anything and whose ears heard every whisper of affairs, scandals and the latest social gossip. She was repeatedly asked to write a tell-all book about her life but would always respond that she knew too many secrets to tell them all. It is a cliché to say someone is one of a kind, but in Aileens case, there is no better description. This exhibition reflects the spirit of our 40th anniversary season honoring our history, showcasing our extraordinary collection and articulating a bold and engaging vision for our future, said Kent State University Museum Director Sarah Spinner Liska, Ph.D., J.D. The Sparkle: The Style and Jewelry of Aileen Mehle exhibition includes a specially designed installation an imagined, custom-built closet showcasing Mehles garments, offering an intimate and engaging glimpse into her iconic style."
