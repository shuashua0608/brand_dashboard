n32ouuh,2025-07-14 13:40:44,en,REDDIT,"  As the meme shows, a lot of GNC people, especially cis GNC straight men, get nagged constantly about their identity as if they can't think about it for themselves, and it gets really tiring. It *could* make their life better, but given the actual rarity of trans people you're far, far more likely to just cause further irritation and distress to someone who is trying to live their life not as a stereotype, so I don't think people need to take it upon themselves to swoop into strangers' lives and be the hero who shows them the light. I say we should let people figure themselves out, as long as they have the tools to do so, without suggesting identities to them."
n32qw3y,2025-07-14 13:51:40,en,REDDIT,"  >It has a lot to do with systemic oppression. >The experiences of trans men are erased, there's no doubting that; but when was the last time someone made the news because the conservatives thought they were secretly a trans man? It never happens. Same story with bathroom investigations - it's never trans men being accused of being women, it's always trans women being accused of being predatory men. There *are* forms of systemic oppression/transphobia that hyperfocus on trans men, and the youth related transition stuff is a big one. The laws and rhetoric around that *heavily* focus on young trans men and the laws trying to be passed specifically focus on, to put it bluntly, breasts and vaginas. The Trump admin is trying to get FtM SRS re-classed as female genital mutilation for instance. I don't know the last time I've seen a conservative getting weepy-eyed about how little Timmy wants to cut his balls off and get a vagina, but hell if I can't find a million of them bawling into napkins about how their precious little Emily got a hold of some T and now she has a hairy chest and a mini dick and how she's mutilating her beautiful fertile young feeeemale body and twisting it into a horrible hairy homunculus. Another issue is that trans men face higher rates of both lifetime and ""recent"" (I'm not sure how to quantify this, the studies I'm referencing cover the last year and the last 3 years respectively) sexual assault even compared to trans women, some sources suggesting *much* higher. Part of erasure and invisibility is the issue that *systemic oppression is also being erased*. >I see what you mean - I'm interpreting it differently, giving more benefit of the doubt to the women of our community to understand how things are for everyone. There seem to be a lot of other trans women in this thread that are grasping at straws to deny, downplay and brush off the issues that trans men face. I've seen multiple other women here trying to claim that the studies reporting that trans men are more likely to be sexually assaulted is ""flawed research"" despite these studies frequently being cited as the benchmark for almost all of what we know about the oppression both trans men and trans women face in the US (and these studies are frequently cited by other reputable studies and sources as well) and I can almost *guarantee* you that these same trans women denying the sexual assault statistics will use these very same studies when it benefits their worldview. We're talking studies like the National U.S. Transgender Surveys, the Williams Institute study (one of the first studies to separate our experiences even from LGB+ cis people, quantifying that we are disproportionately targeted *for being trans*, not for being perceived as GNC/queer), etc. Fact of the matter is that we have a multitude of reliable and respected studies, (at least US based ones, it's been hard to find studies outside the US that ask the same qualitative questions and one issue I remember finding again and again when researching this was the frequent lumping of trans men and trans women together into this nebulous group, i.e. ""Men, Women, *and Trans*"".) we have point towards trans men being uniquely at risk of both lifetime and recent sexual violence, being more likely to be at risk of IPV, etc. >Trans men are invisible, trans women have a spotlight placed on them and stones thrown at them. You seem to be doing this too a little, though I don't think you're coming at this in bad faith. Being ""invisible"" does not mean just being ignored or feeling a little lonely. Being invisible means the frighteningly high rates of sexual, physical and social violence done to trans men/trans mascs is ignored and downplayed even by those who should know and do better. Trans men do not have an absence of stones being thrown at them. They just get those stones thrown at them in the shadows."
mov_FA36CDCEC7A9BD4A18479E694106ED11,2025-07-14 15:08:16,en,WEB,"  For millions of Indians seeking a healthier, more vibrant life, GNC India Nutritional Solutions has become a trusted companion. As a dominant force in the health supplement industry, GNC India blends global scientific expertise with a deep understanding of local health needs. Backed by rigorous quality standards, innovative formulations, and an unwavering commitment to consumer trust, GNC India stands tall as more than just a supplement provider – it's a partner in holistic wellness. From athletes chasing peak performance to busy professionals managing stress and families prioritizing preventive care, GNC India offers science-backed solutions tailored for diverse lifestyles. This leadership position isn't accidental; it's built on decades of global heritage, relentless innovation, and a genuine connection with India's evolving health aspirations. Let's explore how GNC India Nutritional Solutions is shaping the future of wellness across the nation. GNC India Nutritional Solutions: A Legacy Rooted in Science and Growth The story of GNC India Nutritional Solutions begins with the powerful legacy of its parent company, GNC (General Nutrition Centers), founded in Pittsburgh, USA, in 1935. Originally a small health food store, GNC grew into the world's largest global specialty health and wellness retailer. Its entry into the Indian market marked a pivotal moment for the country's burgeoning health supplement sector. Recognizing India's unique nutritional challenges and diverse dietary habits, GNC India wasn't just about importing global products; it was about adaptation and localization. Key milestones defined its ascent: Establishment & Localization: GNC India launched with a clear strategy: combine GNC's global research and development prowess with formulations addressing specific Indian needs, such as Vitamin D deficiencies, vegetarian protein sources, and traditional herb integrations like Ashwagandha and Turmeric in scientifically validated doses. Omnichannel Dominance: Understanding India's diverse shopping habits, GNC India pioneered a robust omnichannel approach. They established a strong footprint in premium malls and high-street locations while simultaneously building a sophisticated e-commerce platform, making premium supplements accessible nationwide. This strategy proved crucial, especially during periods like the COVID-19 pandemic, where demand for immunity boosters skyrocketed. Flagship Innovations: The introduction of lines like GNC Pro Performance and GNC Mega Men/Women, tailored with region-specific nutrient profiles, solidified its reputation. Their commitment to quality was underscored by partnerships with bodies like the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI), ensuring all products met stringent safety norms. The brand's global recognition provided instant credibility, while its focus on local relevance cemented its market position . This foundation of trust, built on decades of global expertise and a decade-plus of focused Indian operations, propelled GNC India Nutritional Solutions to the forefront, setting the stage for a product revolution. Revolutionizing Wellness: GNC India's Science-Backed Product Ecosystem GNC India Nutritional Solutions doesn't just sell supplements; it offers meticulously crafted nutritional strategies. Their extensive portfolio caters to every life stage and health goal, fundamentally shifting how Indians approach preventive and performance nutrition: Core Categories Driving Industry Standards:   Protein Powerhouses: GNC India revolutionized the protein market beyond basic whey. Their offerings include plant-based proteins (pea, brown rice, soy) catering to vegetarian preferences, lean mass gainers, and cutting-edge hydrolyzed whey and casein for rapid absorption, addressing the protein gap prevalent in Indian diets. Vitamins & Minerals (VMS): Moving beyond generic multivitamins, GNC offers targeted solutions. Think high-potency Vitamin D3 for widespread deficiency, specialized B-Complex formulations for energy metabolism in stressful lifestyles, and easily absorbable mineral chelates (like Iron Bisglycinate) crucial for Indian women. Specialty Supplements: This is where GNC's innovation shines. Clinically studied ingredients like Curcumin (95% curcuminoids) for inflammation, branded probiotics (like GNC ProBiotic 25 Billion) for gut health, and condition-specific blends for joint support (featuring Glucosamine, Chondroitin, MSM) or sleep (with Melatonin, L-Theanine) set new benchmarks for efficacy. Performance & Weight Management: Products like GNC AMP Pure Isolate and pre-workouts fuel India's growing fitness culture, while scientifically formulated thermogenics and appetite controllers support sustainable weight management journeys. Shaping Consumer Behavior: GNC India's impact is evident in how consumers now shop:  Demand for Transparency: Their detailed labeling, Certificates of Analysis (CoAs) availability for many products, and clear ingredient sourcing information raised industry standards, forcing competitors to follow suit. Consumers increasingly seek this level of detail. Personalization Trend: GNC's diverse range, from basic essentials to pro-level sports nutrition and condition-specific formulas, empowered consumers to move away from one-size-fits-all solutions towards personalized nutrition stacks. Their knowledgeable in-store staff and online resources further support this. Shift to Preventive Health: By offering high-quality immunity boosters (Vitamin C, Zinc, Elderberry), heart health supplements (Fish Oil, CoQ10), and bone support formulas, GNC India played a key role in driving the trend from reactive treatment to proactive wellness. Insights into India's growing focus on preventive health can be found in reports by institutions like the National Institute of Nutrition (external link – opens in new tab), highlighting the critical need for nutritional interventions. The product offerings from GNC India Nutritional Solutions aren't merely commodities; they represent accessible, science-driven tools empowering Indians to take charge of their health. Pioneering the Future: Innovation and Technology at GNC India's Core GNC India Nutritional Solutions maintains its leadership by embedding innovation deep within its DNA . This isn't just about new flavors; it's about groundbreaking science and technology: Advanced Delivery Systems: GNC invests heavily in enhancing how nutrients are absorbed and utilized by the body . Technologies like:  Solu-Tech®: Improves the dissolution and absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and coenzyme Q10. Chelated Minerals (e.g., Albion®): Minerals bound to amino acids for significantly higher absorption compared to common mineral salts, crucial for combating deficiencies. Time-Release Formulas: Ensure sustained nutrient delivery over several hours for optimal efficacy, especially for B-vitamins. Rigorous Research & Development: GNC's commitment is backed by a global R&D powerhouse. They conduct and fund clinical trials on their formulations and ingredients, ensuring claims are evidence-based. This dedication has resulted in numerous patents for unique blends and delivery mechanisms. Strategic Partnerships: Collaboration fuels progress. GNC partners with leading ingredient suppliers possessing proprietary, clinically validated ingredients (like CarnoSyn® Beta-Alanine or PurCaf® Organic Caffeine). They also collaborate with research institutions and universities globally to stay at the cutting edge of nutritional science...."
1lzpv3j,2025-07-14 15:44:23,es,REDDIT,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Hola gente, ¿cómo va? Sé que hay muchos posts preguntando por esto, pero no encontré respuestas puntuales a lo que quiero saber. Estoy pensando en alquilar el auto de mi esposa (que está sin usar más que para ir a comprar hace meses) para que lo usen en Uber y/o Cabify, y tengo varias dudas que no termino de resolver. El auto es un Virtus 2018 con GNC, bastante cuidado. También tengo un candidato a chofer que es el papá de un amigo que sé que va a cuidar el auto. Tengo en cuenta lo que dicen de que el auto se destruye, y en cierto modo tengo eso cubierto con el taller de mi viejo. Quiero saber: * ¿Cuánto se le está pagando hoy en día a los choferes que manejan autos alquilados? ¿Es por semana, porcentaje, un fijo + el resto para él? * ¿Se puede usar en las 2 plataformas? * ¿Es necesario carnet profesional? Vi posts que decían que sí y algunos que decían que no. * ¿Se usa mi cuenta de Uber/Cabify o se tiene que crear una el papá de mi amigo y lo agrego como socio? Pregunto porque algunas veces me subí a un auto manejado por una mujer, pero en la app aparecía un nombre de hombre (o al revés), entonces no entiendo si comparten cuenta, si es legal, o cómo es ese arreglo. * ¿Tienen contrato escrito sellado y firmado en una escribanía? * Confío en el chofer pero ¿Instalarían GPS o rastreo? * ¿Cómo se maneja el tema del seguro, tiene que ser alguno en específico o puede ser cualquiera? ¿Es recomendable poner un seguro total? Si alguno ya lo está haciendo o conoce bien el tema, agradecería mucho si me cuenta cómo lo maneja, qué recomiendan, y si realmente vale la pena. Gracias de antemano!!"
n34t60r,2025-07-14 19:43:49,en,REDDIT,"  initially i thought it would be fun to hc mizuki as ftm or transmasc, because i assumed their transness wouldn't be confirmed beyond using they/them pronouns. and as a genderfluid person who prefers to dress feminine when i'm feeling male and masculine when i'm feeling female, i decided to project that love of dressing gnc onto mizuki! however later on the story heavily implies that mizuki is transfem, so while i might still enjoy an AU, transmasc mizuki just isn't supported by canon anymore!"

Yo mismo hago Uber y tengo compañeros que mantienen a sus familias tranquilamente así. 1. Al alquilar un vos pones un precio por semana o por día o mes, el chófer tiene que encargarse de pagarte eso y el resto será su ganancia. Así que tendrás que colocar un precio que les sira a ambos. Hoy en día el alquiler de un cronos /Logan rondan Los 300-350k semanales con gnc. 2. Lo puedes usar hasta de pedidos ya si quieres. (Cualquier app todas al mismo tiempo) 3. No es necesario el carnet profesional pero ayuda para más adelante con tema del seguro y papeles. (Disminuye riesgos) 4. El chófer tiene que tener su cuenta propia y vos solo le das la cédula del auto para que lo agregue a sus autos con que va a trabajar, tu situación fue algo ilegal que alguien alquilaba o compró alguna cuenta esto es peligro ya que si pasa algo quedas pegado legalmente hasta que se demuestre lo contrario. 5. A gusto, algunas empresas como de rentas y localiza te hacen un contrato esto va a depender de ustedes. (También su negocio se alimenta al hacer estos contratos) 6. A gusto también, yo tengo GPS por más que manejo mi propio auto para en caso de robo poder recuperarlo y seguir trabajando. (Aumenta el costo) 7. Si o si necesitas un seguro que cubra Específicamente Uber o Cabify, tener un seguro para uso común y trabajar el auto invalida la mayoría de las pólizas y quedas totalmente en bolas si pasa algo.

mov_B64679ACDE955442ADF6FD9DE63C0385,2025-07-15 06:02:48,en,WEB,"  Over 70% of freight in Argentina is moved by road, a statistic that underscores the critical need for modernization and sustainability within the country's trucking industry. The recent launch of the IVECO S-WAY in Argentina isn't just the arrival of a new vehicle; it's a signal of a broader shift towards connected, efficient, and environmentally conscious transportation solutions. This isn't simply about a new truck; it's about reshaping an entire logistics ecosystem. IVECO S-WAY: A Technological Leap for Argentina The IVECO S-WAY, lauded as the most advanced truck in the company's history, brings Euro VI emission standards to Argentina for the first time. This is a significant step, as Euro VI regulations drastically reduce particulate matter and nitrogen oxide emissions, contributing to improved air quality and public health. But the S-WAY's advancements extend beyond emissions. The vehicle boasts total connectivity, offering fleet managers unprecedented levels of data and control. This includes real-time vehicle monitoring, predictive maintenance, and optimized route planning – all crucial for maximizing efficiency and minimizing downtime. The Rise of Connectivity in Commercial Vehicles The integration of connectivity isn't merely a feature; it's becoming a foundational requirement for modern fleets. Data-driven insights allow for proactive maintenance, reducing unexpected breakdowns and associated costs. Furthermore, connectivity enables over-the-air software updates, ensuring vehicles are always running the latest and most efficient software versions. This trend is accelerating globally, and Argentina's adoption of the S-WAY positions it to benefit from these advancements. The partnership with Punto Truck to modernize the IVECO network further emphasizes this commitment to a digitally integrated future. Beyond Diesel: The Role of Alternative Fuels The S-WAY's availability in GNC (Compressed Natural Gas) versions is particularly noteworthy. Argentina has a well-established GNC infrastructure, making it a viable and readily available alternative to diesel. This is crucial as the global transportation sector faces increasing pressure to decarbonize. While electric trucks are gaining traction, GNC offers a more immediate and practical solution for long-haul transportation in many regions, including Argentina. The “Rock and Power on Wheels” special edition highlights the potential for customization and branding within this evolving landscape. The Future of Alternative Fuels in Latin America The adoption of alternative fuels isn't limited to GNC. Biodiesel, renewable diesel, and even hydrogen are gaining momentum across Latin America. Government incentives and increasing environmental awareness are driving this shift. IVECO's commitment to offering a range of powertrain options, including GNC, positions them as a leader in this transition. We can expect to see further investment in alternative fuel infrastructure and a growing demand for vehicles capable of running on these fuels in the coming years. Metric Current Status (Argentina) Projected Growth (Next 5 Years) Euro VI Adoption Initial Launch with IVECO S-WAY >50% of new heavy-duty vehicle sales Alternative Fuel Vehicle Share 5% 15-20% Fleet Connectivity Rate 20% >60% Implications for the Argentinian Logistics Sector The arrival of the IVECO S-WAY and the modernization of the IVECO network through Punto Truck have far-reaching implications for the Argentinian logistics sector. Increased efficiency, reduced emissions, and improved safety are just the beginning. The ability to collect and analyze data from connected vehicles will enable logistics companies to optimize their operations, reduce costs, and improve customer service. This will ultimately lead to a more competitive and sustainable logistics industry. The integration of these technologies also presents challenges. Investment in infrastructure, training for technicians and drivers, and cybersecurity measures are all essential to ensure a smooth transition. However, the long-term benefits of a modernized and sustainable logistics sector far outweigh the initial costs. Frequently Asked Questions About the Future of Commercial Vehicles in Argentina What impact will the Euro VI standard have on operating costs? While the initial investment in Euro VI vehicles may be higher, the long-term operating costs are expected to be lower due to improved fuel efficiency and reduced maintenance requirements...."

And while I do think Ferris is probably transfem, I feel like that partially discredits the point of the way their story is told. I don't think Ferris is ""clearly transfem"", I think they're ""very much not clearly, but in the end probably transfem."" And I mean it in a good way: I think the point of Felix's story *is the journey itself*. Exploring your own gender can and often is messy, confusing, taking forever to settle and figure things out. Whichever Ferris' destination is, be it femboy, transform, cos guy that had a cross dressing phase, that is not the point of their story. The point is that they're figuring themself out and it's messy, rough, imprecise. Or at least... That's my interpretation, I'm giving the author the benefit of the doubt because they once said ""Ferris' story is one that only that kind of character can provide"" - and for once in the history of japan I'm hoping they meant it's not just the classic ""GNC for comedy"" trope."

I'm half-Japanese and speak pretty fluently, I don't look very Asian though so people assume I'm a foreigner who doesn't speak the language. I've had bad interactions in Germany in bathrooms but they were few and people mostly just asume that I'm a GNC woman or at least know wtf I'm doing. Here in Japan I pass completely as male though, even though I feel like I do have clear feminine facial features. I have basically no boobs and my body in general is pretty masculine bc I work out, which doesn't help in my case. People just think I'm a boy/guy and the death stares I get here (it's been a week lmao) are making me feel terrible. I feel like it's only a matter of time until someone calls security on me and I really really want to avoid that interaction. I've been sticking to gender neutral bathrooms in conbinis but sometimes I just have to use a regular toilet and I fucking hate it. In Germany it is super important to me to make it clear that I am a woman and that I belong in women's spaces and that my masculinity doesn't take away from that. I'm wondering though if I should just bite the bullet and use the men's toilet in Japan. On the other hand in my mind I'm so clearly a woman I'm also scared to get confronted there? I'm wondering if any other butches that identify as women have had similar experiences in Japan and if you have any advice on what I should do the next few weeks?"

n3ryauf,2025-07-18 07:16:06,en,REDDIT,"  Being more comfortable around girls and women? Yup I can fully relate to that. I was very socially awkward, stunted and very much a loner throughout most of primary and middle school and only started opening up *a little* in high school, and then further on. Despite that and the fact I never managed to make a lasting friendship (with anyone, mind, not just with girls), I always felt more comfortable around them. They'd feel safe and I wished I could relate to them. (Oh, this is me realizing I was actually scared of interacting with boys my age even back then. New early sign unlocked lol.) Fast forward to a couple months ago, I was trying to ""find my masculinity"" as opposed to toxic masculinity that you see seemingly everywhere on the internet nowadays. Long story short, I found out I'm trans non-binary lol. Though I do believe I'd be GNC even if I wasn't transfeminine. I'm not saying you absolutely are trans or that your experience has to be identical to mine. But these are signs that indicate you might be. I'd recommend checking [the Gender Dysphoria Bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/) and see if something fits. Maybe it will, maybe it won't, either way you'll probably come out more knowledgeable about trans people and dysphoria and hopefully a bit more sure of your own identity. Fears of not passing are also common, and if it does turn out that you're trans, don't let that stop you from transitioning if that's what you want. I haven't started mine yet but I went through that mental process and will look to start HRT this year or early next year potentially."

n3zt7dx,2025-07-19 13:41:56,en,REDDIT,"  I'm NB and out at work— I use Mx. as my honorific, and while I don't usually introduce myself with they/them pronouns outright, I always have some savvy or curious kids who ask and once I tell them, the word gets around and they all start using it lol. I'm the same way with my colleagues, who overall have been supportive and also normal about it thank goodness. Given that I'm pretty stereotypically GNC, if I wasn't out I'd most likely be clocked anyway. Like you I don't love getting into a whole thing about it, but I'm open and honest in a very brief, age-appropriate way when asked (and I do get asked). Usually the response is some variation of “oh ok” or “ok thank you!” and then the conversation is over. I like to keep the focus in class on my content. I know for a fact that it's had a positive impact on my students. I've been privileged enough to witness one of my younger students socially transition from year to year, and several times she's said something in class or let me know that my presence is affirming to her (not in so many words of course, but even things like if I'm teaching a song in a gendered language, she'll say happily “I'm going to use the girl version!” or if I'm wearing a vaguely rainbow thing, she'll say “oh that's for pride!”) . For my older students, several of whom are out only to friends or are in that figuring out stage, they know I'm a safe person to be themselves around (our school has a GSA run by another teacher, but I do music so the crossover is always strong). I also think that generally, it helps all kids to have adults in their lives that are diverse/ different from each other, but also who they see respecting each other and working as colleagues. Of course it hasn't always been perfect and tbh I have had a few negative experiences with kids saying some very inappropriate and discriminatory things in class, but even then I think the other kids see me handle it calmly with poise, and my admin always support me in these instances. They see that it doesn't phase me and I rise above it. Sorry for the Ted Talk!! Long story short, it's totally up to you and what your comfort level/ safety is at, but personally I'm happy with my decision to be out and I think it's a positive thing for me and for the school community."
n40rqyl,2025-07-19 16:44:37,en,REDDIT,"  you can make some interesting arguments about reincarnation and its mechanics like in some isekais where the protagonist is in a new body they have an intense sense of alienation. and in some it just intuitively ""fits"" you could argue the same for gender, that that is a trait that can change during reincarnation. Honestly, reincarnation and how it affects your sense of self is one of the most interesting thing isekai stories can do. Its shame isekai has become synonymous with ""generic fantasy setting power fantasy"" when it's a genre with so many interesting aspects and potential. (that doesnt change the fact that gender bender stories are almost always trans/gnc coded in some way and interesting to analyse from a trans perspective. I don't disagree with that and it's one of the reasons I often browse manga sites for that tag) PS: I recommend reading ""im a spider, so what"", they have an reincarnated explicitly trans side character, though she doesn't get much screentime. And yes you need to read it, the anime/manga adaptions don't adapt that part of the story."
n40xgb5,2025-07-19 17:13:47,en,REDDIT,"  Thank you for sharing your sibling's experience, I'd like to complement their story with mine: When I was in 7th grade, in the late 90s, I started to experience intense depression. I felt alienated from all my friends and classmates. I developed an eating disorder and engaged in self-injury. I was a good student and I stayed involved in extra-curricular activities all through high school because I was expected to go to a good university, but I had no goals or aspirations for my future. I did go to a good university and made it through, but I slept most of the day, did the bare minimum, and got in a long-term romantic relationship where I was treated like shit, because I didn't think I deserved any better and being in a relationship with someone else gave me sort of a sense of a future, that I still didn't care about. This lasted through most of my 20s. A lot of lost weekends and shitty jobs and shitty relationships, no hopes or goals despite everyone telling me I was smart and had potential. It wasn't until 2012 that I learned more about people's experiences in the trans community and came out to myself as non-binary. I completed a master's degree and moved halfway across the country to give myself a fresh start. I'm in my 40s now, and it was only in the last several years that I have developed goals for my future and see myself getting old (how likely that is in the current situation we're all in, we shall see). All of this to say: looking back, if I had realized I was experiencing gender dysphoria, or if someone had seen that in me, I would have been spared years of pain and wasted time. And I have a life of relative privilege, and probably divine intervention, where I made it through the hard times okay. Most trans/GNC people aren't as lucky as I have been. Minors who are seeking gender affirming healthcare are closer to who I was than some strawman Veruca Salt. And if anyone wishes what I lived-- and again, *I was extremely lucky*-- on a *child*, they need to fix their hearts or fucking die."

1m4hq52,2025-07-20 06:13:05,en,REDDIT,"  I grew up as a socially isolated, undiagnosed but probably autistic girl. I never had many friends and if I did they were never long term. I started socially transitioning freshman year when I was 14, and medically at 18. My immediate family views me as a mentally ill lesbian, and none of my extended family even those in town don't know I'm trans. I have a couple friends but really only one. She's super supportive and even gave me a ride to my top surgery . My coworkers are also generally accepting, one even correcting customers on my behalf though I don't know how I feel about that. Even though I've been transitioning for years I've started to realize that by other people's standards, I was in the closet. I wouldn't go out of my way to tell people unless they were close to me and I don't correct people I just wait for them to realize themselves. At the same time I'm transitioning, I'm becoming an adult. I want to be in queer spaces because I'm very GNC in terms of my interests and my mannerisms. I feel very close and safe with especially queer women because I relate to them the most. I don't mesh with men well, though it's getting better now that I'm post op, I still feel like an outsider. Because I'm in the rural Midwest the only queer spaces I have are online. But now I'm seeing more and more that trans guys aren't as represented as they once were. And I feel guilty for wanting people to include us when posting and talking about queer people."

n45viqq,2025-07-20 13:29:38,en,REDDIT,"  I think you are moving the goal posts by saying it's strip mall business. I think more strip mall business is there now because they've added around a thousand new apartments since 15 years ago so the locals want these businesses. Like Hollywood feed, gnc, subway, hr block, la fitness. Also there is a nice a dog park now for all those new residents. Painting with a twist and Mix your own candles have good reviews. These are things you can't order online which is good in the age of e-commerce. Rei shut down the suburban Robinson location instead of  south side works bc it's next to the river trail and boat launch that tie into their business. Pins mechanical is popular. Nan Xiang soup dumplings is delicious. Slice on broadway pizza is good if you don't want papa johns. I think the area has bounced back from the lows of retail apocalypse and COVID shutdowns. It will continue to do well enough. I think Pittsburgh overbuilt its destination districts on every closed steel mill and there has been some growing pains bc this happened right when Amazon took off. Now these places are pivoting and adding a lot of housing. I feel like SSW should be for locals while station square is pre touristy and waterfront is more big box stores."

n47t54h,2025-07-20 19:30:09,en,REDDIT,"  Spicy, i'm going to lay this out for you as simply as possible. If Toby wanted to insinuate that ralsei was anything but a goat boy, he would've done that already. He's made a trans character before ralsei. Ralsei is a boy, and denying that he is one is reinforcing gender norms, and implying that you can't be a boy if you have pink horns, are kind and compassionate, and don't conform to the normal societal standard of what a ""man"" is. He is referred to MULTIPLE times throughout the story as a ""prince""; A title typically reserved for boys. If at any point Toby Fox wanted to tell us Ralsei is trans, he would've put dialogue or a scene where Ralsei says ""I'm not quite sure I like the title 'Prince'"", or ""I think I'm a girl."" Toby is not shy about queerness. Ralsei is so violently a GNC character it's insane that ""trans ralsei"" is a thing."
