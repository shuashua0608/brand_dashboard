I read that creapure is better than normal creatine but creatine is cheaper. I looked through a post about creatine in a subreddit about my country. Everyone said they sourced their creatine from this popular online shopping platform that's similar to amazon cause it was apparently the cheapest place. The website is selling optimum nutrition micronized creatine powder 300g for 36.80 dollars. But the decathlon in my country is selling creapure powder 300g for 24.90 dollars. Am i missing something obvious? Why did everyone in my country recommend to buy online when its clearly cheaper at decathlon? Is decathlon creapure considered bad or ineffective or something since its that much cheaper?"

I was in the same boat, ‚Äúman I'm gonna go on a crazy cut, I wanna lose it all as fast as possible‚Äù (Maybe you're not thinking like that lmao who knows) But as someone who's been fat and is now fit my biggest piece of advice is to do a body recomp, which is losing weight through putting on muscle and losing fat. You can search up a calculator to figure this out since I'm not really sure the math behind it I never did this, and it was my biggest regret. First of all, get yourself some whey protein, Its like 40 bucks on amazon. I get ‚ÄúOptimum Nutrition Gold Standard 100% Whey Protein Powder, Double Rich Chocolate‚Äù Make sure you get a shaker bottle too with those little whisks balls in the cup The chocolate one tastes really good, but make sure you mix it with water, because mixing with milk is way too many calories. I like to have 2 scoops of protein powder in my drink, and I personally drink it 2 times a day Secondly, you're going to need to make an effort to EAT properly, get your protein in, try to eat your carbs at night, and get some health fats in. One great way to do this is by eating avocados, but don't eat too many because they are very calorie dense. 90% of getting built is made on your diet, and since you're going to be in a body recomp/cut, you're going to need to get accustomed to being hungry, and STANDING ON BUSINESS with your calories. At a minimum, find out the calories you SHOULD be eating for example 2300 calories a day, and count the calories you ACTUALLY eat, you will really be shocked once you start seeing what kind of shit you're eating, and it'll start a subconscious shift in your mind Also make sure get a gym membership, and go to the gym as frequently as possible, ideally 3-5 times a week, I like to use the push-pull-legs-push-pull-rest split, but that's just me AND MAKE SURE TO SHAVE THE BEARD. keep the goatee, but shave that fuckin Reddit beard that's coming in, I'm saying this out of love when I say that it does NOT look good, we've all been there. Other than that, you have unbelievable potential, you don't even understand. You aren't gonna unlock that potential unless you start putting in some work, but I trust in the process bro üí™ good luck man"

mov_5025D84F9AE63522B9F3E7EE74ED15C8,2025-07-17 06:45:35,it,WEB,"‚Äâ SPR_COMBO[it]La creatina √® uno degli integratori pi√π utilizzati nel mondo del fitness e del bodybuilding. Nota per la sua efficacia nell'aumentare la forza e la massa muscolare, √® anche oggetto di numerosi studi scientifici che ne confermano i benefici. Tuttavia, non tutte le forme di creatina sono uguali, e nemmeno le modalit√† di assunzione. In questa guida approfondita vedremo quale creatina scegliere , come usarla correttamente e quali effetti aspettarsi per ottenere il massimo sviluppo muscolare in sicurezza. Cos'√® la creatina e come funziona nel corpo        La creatina √® una molecola prodotta naturalmente nel corpo a partire da tre aminoacidi: arginina, glicina e metionina . Si trova principalmente nei muscoli, dove viene convertita in fosfocreatina , un composto che svolge un ruolo cruciale nella produzione di energia rapida (ATP) durante sforzi intensi e brevi, come il sollevamento pesi o gli scatti. Integrare creatina significa aumentare le riserve di fosfocreatina nei muscoli, permettendo di sostenere carichi di lavoro maggiori, stimolando pi√π efficacemente la sintesi proteica e, nel tempo, la crescita muscolare . I benefici della creatina per l'aumento della massa muscolare     Ecco i principali vantaggi che rendono la creatina uno degli integratori pi√π efficaci per l'ipertrofia:      Incremento della forza massimale e della potenza esplosiva    Maggiore volume di allenamento (pi√π ripetizioni e serie)    Aumento della ritenzione intracellulare di acqua muscolare, che migliora l'anabolismo    Stimolazione indiretta della sintesi proteica grazie a sessioni pi√π intense    Recupero muscolare pi√π rapido tra una serie e l'altra     Quale tipo di creatina scegliere: le forme pi√π diffuse a confronto     Non tutte le forme di creatina sono ugualmente efficaci. Vediamo le principali:         Conclusione : per la maggior parte delle persone, la creatina monoidrato (meglio se micronizzata ) resta la scelta migliore per rapporto efficacia/prezzo/sicurezza . Come assumere correttamente la creatina     Per sfruttare al meglio i benefici della creatina, √® importante rispettare dosaggi e tempistiche adeguate. Esistono due approcci principali:     Fase di carico + mantenimento     Carico : 20 g al giorno divisi in 4 dosi da 5 g per 5‚Äì7 giorni    Mantenimento : 3‚Äì5 g al giorno per le settimane successive      Questo metodo accelera la saturazione muscolare ma non √® obbligatorio. Potrebbero verificarsi gonfiore o disturbi intestinali nei soggetti sensibili. Assunzione costante     3‚Äì5 g al giorno, ogni giorno, senza fase di carico      Richiede circa 3 settimane per raggiungere la saturazione muscolare, ma √® pi√π tollerabile per molti. Quando assumere la creatina     Gli studi mostrano che l'assunzione post-allenamento , insieme a carboidrati e proteine, pu√≤ ottimizzare l'assorbimento e favorire la sintesi muscolare. Consiglio pratico :  Prendi 3‚Äì5 g di creatina monoidrato dopo l'allenamento insieme a uno shake proteico o a una fonte di carboidrati semplici. Effetti collaterali, miti da sfatare e sicurezza    √à pericolosa per i reni? Numerosi studi dimostrano che la creatina non danneggia i reni in soggetti sani. Chi ha problemi renali preesistenti dovrebbe consultare un medico. Fa ingrassare? No, ma pu√≤ causare un leggero aumento del peso corporeo (1‚Äì2 kg) nelle prime settimane per effetto della ritenzione idrica intracellulare , un meccanismo favorevole alla crescita muscolare. Deve essere ciclizzata? Non √® necessario interromperla ciclicamente. L'uso prolungato (fino a 5 anni) si √® dimostrato sicuro e benefico se rispettati i dosaggi. Creatina e dieta: √® sufficiente quella contenuta negli alimenti? Alimenti come carne rossa e pesce contengono circa 1‚Äì2 g di creatina ogni 500 g , quantit√† troppo bassa per raggiungere la saturazione muscolare senza integrazione. L'integratore √® quindi altamente consigliato , specie per vegetariani e vegani che hanno livelli naturalmente pi√π bassi. Con un uso costante e inserita in un contesto di allenamento strutturato e dieta iperproteica bilanciata , la creatina pu√≤ diventare un alleato fondamentale per chi desidera sviluppare massa muscolare in modo efficace e sicuro .

The company currently ranks sixth globally for dairy brand value and was recognized as the most valuable food and beverage brand in Southeast Asia in Brand Finance's Food and Drink 2023 ranking. Additionally, it is the only Vietnamese dairy company featured in the Fortune Southeast Asia 500 ranking (2024), underscoring its strong market presence in the region.In Vietnam, around 55% of infants are not exclusively breastfed during their first six months[1]. This means many babies may miss out on the full range of benefits found in breast milk, especially human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which support gut and immune development. To address this gap, Vinamilk pioneered Vietnam's first formula containing six HMOs[2]-nutrients naturally found in breast milk-to enhance both digestive and immune health. This solution is particularly impactful in a country where nearly 60% of working mothers struggle to balance both work and family commitments . This challenge is not unique to Vietnam. Across Asia, exclusive breastfeeding rates remain modest, reaching only 52.9% in the Asia-Pacific and 48.3% in Southeast Asia[3] primarily due to lifestyle shifts, work demands, and social pressure. This is why nutrition solutions that closely mimic breast milk, such as Vinamilk's 6-HMO innovation, received extensive attention from the Summit's expert community. ""I commend Vinamilk's breakthrough not only for advancing nutritional science with Vietnam's first 6-HMO formula, but also for its empathetic, consumer-centric approach. This is a valuable contribution to the Summit's mission of seeking comprehensive health solutions-not just in terms of nutrition, but also in creating positive social impact, especially for women and children,"" said Gary Scattergood, Editor-in-Chief of FoodNavigator Asia and NutraIngredients Asia, the Summit's organizing entities. Once a market dominated by imported dairy products, Vietnam is now home to Vinamilk, the first local brand not only to catch up, but to lead regional innovation in pediatric nutrition. While the market had plateaued at 5-HMO formulas since 2021, Vinamilk chose not to compromise and instead accelerated its R&D efforts to break this ceiling. In 2023, Vinamilk entered strategic partnerships with six leading global nutrition companies (DSM - Switzerland, Novonesis, formerly Chr. Hansen - Denmark, Beneo - Germany, Gnosis - Italy, AAK - Sweden, and Kanematsu - Japan) to enhance scientific capability and innovation in infant formula development. The launch of the Optimum line, powered by a 6-HMO formula that accounts for approximately 58% of the total HMO composition found in natural breast milk[4], exemplifies the successful integration of research and international collaboration. The 6-HMO innovation brings significant benefits for infant digestion and immunity. It mimics critical oligosaccharides in breast milk, fosters the development of beneficial gut bacteria in infants and protects against pathogens. The formulation also includes both difucosyllactose (DFL) and 3-fucosyllactose (3-FL), two HMOs that are rarely found together in other commercial infant formulas. Nguyen Quang Tri, Chief Marketing Officer of Vinamilk, stated, ""Our 6-HMO breakthrough not only raises nutritional standards, but also helps support parents navigating breastfeeding challenges. At Vinamilk, we believe that when parents are happy, a child's development is more complete. We believe this message doesn't just apply to Vietnam - it resonates with millions of parents across Asia."" Vinamilk's contribution to the Growth Asia Summit 2025 signals a new chapter in Vietnam's innovation journey.

Additionally, it is the only Vietnamese dairy company featured in the Fortune Southeast Asia 500 ranking (2024), underscoring its strong market presence in the region. In Vietnam, around 55% of infants are not exclusively breastfed during their first six months[1]. This means many babies may miss out on the full range of benefits found in breast milk, especially human milk oligosaccharides (HMOs), which support gut and immune development. To address this gap, Vinamilk pioneered Vietnam's first formula containing six HMOs[2]‚Äìnutrients naturally found in breast milk‚Äîto enhance both digestive and immune health. This solution is particularly impactful in a country where nearly 60% of working mothers struggle to balance both work and family commitments. This challenge is not unique to Vietnam. Across Asia, exclusive breastfeeding rates remain modest, reaching only 52.9% in the Asia-Pacific and 48.3% in Southeast Asia[3] primarily due to lifestyle shifts, work demands, and social pressure. This is why nutrition solutions that closely mimic breast milk, such as Vinamilk's 6-HMO innovation, received extensive attention from the Summit's expert community. ""I commend Vinamilk's breakthrough not only for advancing nutritional science with Vietnam's first 6-HMO formula, but also for its empathetic, consumer-centric approach. This is a valuable contribution to the Summit's mission of seeking comprehensive health solutions‚Äînot just in terms of nutrition, but also in creating positive social impact, especially for women and children,"" said Gary Scattergood, Editor-in-Chief of FoodNavigator Asia and NutraIngredients Asia, the Summit's organizing entities. Once a market dominated by imported dairy products, Vietnam is now home to Vinamilk, the first local brand not only to catch up, but to lead regional innovation in pediatric nutrition. While the market had plateaued at 5-HMO formulas since 2021, Vinamilk chose not to compromise and instead accelerated its R&D efforts to break this ceiling. In 2023, Vinamilk entered strategic partnerships with six leading global nutrition companies (DSM ‚Äì Switzerland, Novonesis, formerly Chr. Hansen ‚Äì Denmark, Beneo ‚Äì Germany, Gnosis ‚Äì Italy, AAK ‚Äì Sweden, and Kanematsu ‚Äì Japan) to enhance scientific capability and innovation in infant formula development. The launch of the Optimum line, powered by a 6-HMO formula that accounts for approximately 58% of the total HMO composition found in natural breast milk[4], exemplifies the successful integration of research and international collaboration. The 6-HMO innovation brings significant benefits for infant digestion and immunity. It mimics critical oligosaccharides in breast milk, fosters the development of beneficial gut bacteria in infants and protects against pathogens. The formulation also includes both difucosyllactose¬†(DFL) and 3-fucosyllactose (3-FL), two HMOs that are rarely found together in other commercial infant formulas. Nguyen Quang Tri, Chief Marketing Officer of Vinamilk, stated, ""Our 6-HMO breakthrough not only raises nutritional standards, but also helps support parents navigating breastfeeding challenges. At Vinamilk, we believe that when parents are happy, a child's development is more complete. We believe this message doesn't just apply to Vietnam ‚Äì it resonates with millions of parents across Asia."" Vinamilk's contribution to the Growth Asia Summit 2025 signals a new chapter in Vietnam's innovation journey. From a country that once had no dairy industry and lagged in nutrition science, Vietnam, through Vinamilk, is stepping into the global spotlight, confidently shaping new standards in pediatric care: proactive, empathetic, and pioneering.

The SixStar preworkout was $12.99 on Amazon prime day The BUM pre workout was like $30 at Costco for 60 servings. . I don't actually use it lmao I should just throw it away. The Woke AF I actually did pay full price for at around $32 I think The Optimum Nutrition AMP preworkout above it was like $26 (I think that's full price) Realistically there's probably about $250 worth of pre workout which is still a lot. . and definitely a few bottles of test lmao I've also gone down the rabbit hole of making my own pre-workout but it's just too time-consuming even if it is cheaper. The flavor is never as good as what you can get in a RYSE pre-workout.

At Optimum Wound Care Center, an outpatient clinic in Louisville, a personalized, multidisciplinary approach is making a meaningful difference in how these wounds are managed and healed.

At Optimum Wound Care Center, an outpatient clinic in Louisville, a personalized, multidisciplinary approach is making a meaningful difference in how these wounds are managed and healed. The center is highlighting the steps involved in its patient care process, offering a closer look at how specialized wound treatment can reduce complications and promote long-term recovery. From evaluation to education, the clinic's approach is rooted in medical best practices and tailored to each individual's needs. Assessing the Root Causes When a patient visits the clinic, the care team conducts a comprehensive assessment that goes beyond the wound itself. This may include imaging studies, vascular screenings, and a full review of the patient's health history. Identifying conditions like peripheral artery disease (PAD), diabetes, or mobility limitations early in the process is key to creating an effective treatment plan. Specialized Treatment for Common Complications For patients with diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs), the center combines targeted therapies like offloading, debridement, and infection control with patient education on blood sugar management and foot care. Those dealing with pressure injuries‚Äîcommon among people with limited mobility‚Äîreceive treatments focused on pressure relief, nutrition, and moisture balance. ‚ÄúEvery wound has a story,‚Äù said Mosayeb (Moe) Karimi, FNP, lead provider at the center. ‚ÄúOur job is to understand the full picture, not just the symptoms.

Patients are screened for PAD and venous insufficiency, and when necessary, referred to vascular specialists for further care. Compression therapy is frequently used to assist with circulation in venous wounds. Ongoing Monitoring and Advanced Therapies Long-term patients are evaluated weekly, with progress tracked through photo documentation and dressing adjustments. Depending on the case, the team may incorporate more advanced therapies like negative pressure wound therapy, which has been shown to support faster healing in complex cases. What sets the clinic apart is its collaborative, team-based model, which includes physicians, nurses, and therapists- all focused on individualized recovery goals. Educating Patients Beyond the Clinic In addition to hands-on treatment, Optimum Wound Care places a strong emphasis on education. Patients receive clear instructions for home care, wound dressing, and recognizing warning signs. This added layer of support can help prevent wound recurrence and reduce unnecessary hospital visits. ‚ÄúWe believe that empowering patients with the right knowledge is just as important as the treatments we provide,‚Äù said Karimi. ‚ÄúThe goal is not just to close the wound, but to improve the patient's overall quality of life.‚Äù About Optimum Wound Care Center Optimum Wound Care Center is a specialized outpatient facility in Louisville, Kentucky, focused on treating chronic and hard-to-heal wounds.

Compression therapy is frequently used to assist with circulation in venous wounds. Ongoing Monitoring and Advanced Therapies Long-term patients are evaluated weekly, with progress tracked through photo documentation and dressing adjustments. Depending on the case, the team may incorporate more advanced therapies like negative pressure wound therapy, which has been shown to support faster healing in complex cases. What sets the clinic apart is its collaborative, team-based model, which includes physicians, nurses, and therapists- all focused on individualized recovery goals. Educating Patients Beyond the Clinic In addition to hands-on treatment, Optimum Wound Care places a strong emphasis on education. Patients receive clear instructions for home care, wound dressing, and recognizing warning signs. This added layer of support can help prevent wound recurrence and reduce unnecessary hospital visits. ‚ÄúWe believe that empowering patients with the right knowledge is just as important as the treatments we provide,‚Äù said Karimi. ‚ÄúThe goal is not just to close the wound, but to improve the patient's overall quality of life.‚Äù About Optimum Wound Care Center Optimum Wound Care Center is a specialized outpatient facility in Louisville, Kentucky, focused on treating chronic and hard-to-heal wounds. The clinic provides individualized care plans for conditions including diabetic ulcers, pressure injuries, and vascular-related wounds. With a focus on long-term outcomes, the team blends clinical expertise with personalized support to help patients heal safely and sustainably.

How can I lose those pounds in a healthy way? Sincerely, U.S. Air Force Major G. Luke Gagon To achieve optimum body weight composition (your fit-to-fat ratio) you'll need to commit to regular exercise and a nutritious diet. Should these lifestyle changes not result in reaching your fitness goals, you may consider discussing weight-loss treatment options with your healthcare provider, including medications that may be appropriate for your specific medical needs and TRICARE coverage. That's the message from Dr. Marc Alaric Franzos, a cardiologist at the Uniformed Services University in Bethesda, Maryland. He emphasizes regular physical activity and a heart-healthy Mediterranean-style diet for maximum physical fitness and overall health. ‚ÄúLifestyle modification is relatively straightforward. It's exactly what you would expect‚Äîmove more, eat less, and sleep well,‚Äù Franzos said. Ideally, service members should aim for cardiovascular health that includes ‚Äúat least 150 minutes, maybe up to 300 minutes of moderate exertion, aerobic activity per week,‚Äù said Franzos. ‚ÄúIf you're doing vigorous exercise where you're getting up into heart rate zones above 85% [of maximum], you can actually cut it down to 75 to 150 minutes per week, but ultimately that means you're still moving quite a bit, and that's a minimum.‚Äù ‚ÄúRegular, vigorous exercise where you can't carry on a conversation can be hard to maintain session-to-session, so most of your effort should be in the moderate zones.‚Äù Franzos. ‚ÄúIt can even include walking if you walk briskly.‚Äù This weight-bearing exercise helps ‚Äúmaintain the muscle on the bones, but also the bones themselves,‚Äù because you want to ‚Äúavoid osteoporosis, or thinning out of the bones.‚Äù ‚ÄúDiet can be used for comfort, it can be used for celebration, it can be used for friendship, but it's also important to recognize that it's fuel,‚Äù for the warfighter, said Franzos. The Trouble with Losing Weight is Keeping it Off Losing excess weight is hard to begin with, but so is keeping it off, Franzos said. When lifestyle modifications don't achieve desired results, MHS beneficiaries who struggle with weight loss should discuss treatment options with their healthcare providers. Treatment approaches may include medications that are appropriate for their specific medical conditions and covered under their TRICARE benefit. Coverage for weight management medications varies based on medical indication and TRICARE enrollment status. ""Healthcare providers are best positioned to evaluate individual patient needs and determine appropriate treatment options, including newer medications that may be available,"" Franzos noted. ""Traditional weight-loss medicines have typically achieved modest results, with some newer treatments showing improved effectiveness when combined with lifestyle changes."" 'Trust in Your Military Health System' and Don't Go It Alone Franzos cautioned strongly against service members or other beneficiaries ordering medications via mail or from outside the U.S., especially as alternatives to proper medical supervision or because of concerns about treatment access. ‚ÄúIt's just too easy to order something mail order and end up getting a product that may not even contain any GLP-1ra,‚Äù Franzos said, but instead, ‚Äúit may contain other substances which could be very hazardous to your health.‚Äù ‚ÄúI would tell our service members to have trust in your Military Health System, and make an appointment with your primary care doctor, to discuss options and determine if it's a good option for you.‚Äù Military sports medicine and obesity medicine specialists are also available, he noted. ‚ÄúWe've taken a lot of effort to learn about it and ensure that we can give proper counseling, proper guidance, and monitor for the adverse effects that may come up from these medications,‚Äù Franzos said. ‚ÄúBut I guarantee you that the first thing out of your doctor's mouth is going to be, 'Let me talk to you about lifestyle modification,' and they're going to reinforce that, and they're going to want you to prove to them that you've taken genuine efforts on that front for about three to six months.‚Äù Thanks to Dr. Franzos for his guidance on how to lose weight safely, be physically fit, and stay heart healthy at the same time. Major, now is the time to get your weight checked and look for other possible causes of weight gain besides inactivity and unhealthy foods.

I had raised a complaint immediately, but to my shock, it was closed with the conclusion that I received the correct item. This is incorrect and unacceptable. I have photographic proof clearly showing that I received a grocery item instead of whey protein. This is not just a customer service failure ‚Äî it feels like fraud. I request that this issue be re-opened, thoroughly investigated, and resolved with either a full refund or replacement at the earliest. I feel like telling me that I got the correct order instead of investigating the matter correctly is a huge flaw of this customer service. I tried to convey this to the customer service team via phone but they simply hung up to phone on me multiple times.The last 2 complaints team reps who disconnected my call was Rahul which was around 2'o clock and then Parag who I informed and requested not to disconnected the call after telling my previous experience but he also did the same things. This is disappointing to say the least and getting really frustrated now that I've no where to go for help. Please escalate this to the  grievance/redressal officer and respond urgently.

We loaded 136 square bales into our hayloft and the neighbor who cut and baled it got nine large round bales for himself. As the baler spit out its product, I considered the quality of the cured grass and the uniform, tightly packed bales, and thought to myself, ‚ÄúThat sure is a pretty sight.‚Äù At almost the same instant, my wife came up behind me and said out loud, ‚ÄúThat sure is a pretty sight.‚Äù I'm sure she had ample appreciation for the nutrition that was being packaged for cattle and horses to enjoy months from now; but the fact that shorter grass meant fewer hiding places for creeping, slithering things she doesn't want to meet was important to her, too. A second cutting is probably about 3-5 weeks away and it should also be good. My neighbor will want to give the grass all the time it needs to reach its optimum production level. My wife, on the other hand, will be hoping to see more hay bales sooner rather than later.
