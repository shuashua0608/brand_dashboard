 「現在年紀大一點，我會帶的東西也多了一點。 第一個是水袋（Camel Pouch），除了輕巧、外型時尚，它還可塞在外套裡隨身攜帶水，甚至可以放點電解質飲料，隨你喜歡。」 「我還會帶頭燈。 因為我第一次去Glastonbury的時候在黑暗中迷路，算是留下陰影。 自此之後，我不管去哪都要帶頭燈，就算是去度假我也會帶！」 「我覺得在Glastonbury 穿同一件衣服出現兩次不是什麼問題，只要你準備得當。 像是帶把傘，不論擋雨或防曬都能用。 雖然通常不太會下雨，但還是得備而不用。」"

mov_1AE63CE710377EE023D4A79AC384E892,2025-07-14 11:19:34,en,WEB,"  Big moment for Manchester and music fans alike this weekend: Oasis stormed back on stage at Heaton Park for gigs that have been dubbed both “biblical” and “heaven on earth”. And it didn't hurt that the weather delivered either. It might have been blazing 30 degrees sunshine and blue skies, but it still saw Liam Gallagher, forever a man of the overcoat, donning a lightweight jacket in the soaring heat while on stage. However, he wasn't the only one in the Gallagher clan wearing unseasonal outerwear. Liam's 24-year-old son Gene was also sporting a stylish jacket that some fans thought looked rather familiar. Posting a picture on Instagram, Gene posed pre-show with his cousins, brother and Pep Guardiola(!) , wearing the distinctive item. The navy, zip-up jacket – that he wore over a plain black t-shirt – has the unmistakable cross-hatching of Burberry; but one fan was quick to pick up on its bigger significance. “Is that ya dad's Maine Road top”, they asked under the pic, meaning the jacket Liam wore on stage at Oasis's April 1996 gig in Manchester's Maine Road (which can actually be watched in full here). “The exact one,” Gene confirmed, adding: “It's a family heirloom.” Another user chimed in on its potential origin story further: “If I'm not wrong my mate was the manager and worked in Ath-Leisure (owned by JD Sports) store in the Arndale Manchester and sold this to your dad just before Night 1 Maine Rd…. . always wondered if it was kept.” While we're obviously unable to verify this, we can confirm that 29 years later, the look still absolutely slaps. Here's hoping we see Yung Gallagher – or indeed his brother, Lennon – dive through more of his da's iconic wardrobe for the remaining nights of the reunion tour."
mov_304EA9B9BEE315180686CF4161562046,2025-07-14 11:27:54,en,WEB,"  Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer highlights three market-moving stories to watch on Monday, July 14, on Morning Brief: Market Sunrise. Stock futures (ES=F, NQ=F, YM=F) are trading lower as tariff threats from President Trump weigh on investor sentiment. Bitcoin (BTC-USD) hit a fresh all-time high above $122,000 as investors eye crypto as a potential safe haven. Wall Street is also bracing for key inflation data and a flood of earnings, with CPI and big bank results including JPMorgan (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Citigroup (C) on deck. To watch more expert insights and analysis on the latest market action, check out more Morning Brief: Market Sunrise here. 00:00 Speaker A Let's kick it off with the three things you need to know before the opening bell rings by taking a look at the futures board. As you can see, all three, uh, all three futures indexes tied to the major indexes in the US in the red. You can see your S&P 500 futures off about 0.3%, and this is as tariffs are once again in focus. New letters from the President, from President Trump over the weekend, threatened 30% duties on Mexico and the European Union. The latest tariff actions follow a 35% tariff on Canadian goods announced last week. In response, the European Union says it will delay its plans to impose tariffs on US exports to the EU, which had initially been slated for Tuesday, according to the Financial Times. Italy's Foreign Minister, Antonio Taiani, said in a newspaper interview Monday that the EU is prepared with a list of tariffs amounting to more than $24 billion on US goods, should the two sides fail to reach a deal. The latest tariff back and forth has caught the market's attention with the US dollar edging slightly higher on Monday morning against the euro, while European stocks are taking a step lower, and futures tied to those major US stock indexes are also in the red. As tariffs continue to batter the headlines, a potential flight to safety trade continues to balloon in cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin surpassing $122,000 earlier this morning, cracking another fresh all-time high. The world's largest cryptocurrency is now up about 10% in the past week alone and more than 30% this year. US stocks linked to crypto are seeing a pop in pre-market. Michael Sailor strategy, which holds a significant amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet, up about 2% in pre-market trading, while Coinbase and Robinhood exchanges that trade crypto are both up more than 1%. And finally, investors are readying for a big week of expected news releases and economic data and quarterly financial reports. Inflation reports from both the US and Europe will be in particular focus. On Tuesday morning, the core consumer price index, which excludes food and energy, is expected to show price increases accelerated in the US during June. Consensus expects core CPI rose 2.9% over the prior year in June, a step higher from the 2.8% seen in May. Economists believe an increase in line with those expectations will likely prompt the Federal Reserve to once again hold interest rates steady at its July policy meeting. On the corporate front, earnings from large banks, including JP Morgan and Bank of America, will be in focus, while investors will also closely be watching for any tariff related impacts at corporates, including Pepsi, ASML, and Burberry. The latest data from FactSet shows analysts expect S&P 500 earnings grew by just under 5% over the prior year during the second quarter. Should this forecast come true, it will mark the slowest pace of profit growth since the fourth quarter of 2023. Related Videos"

No Overstock, No Discounts     Gonçalo Cruz […] the co-founder and CEO of PlatformE, a tech provider based in Porto, Portugal[…] says virtual luxury can solve the problem of oversupply that hinders the sector's growth. The issue emerged after World War II, when French designers created cheaper, prêt-à-porter collections to boost their bottom lines. This focus on volume, Cruz says, eventually led to the resource-draining fast-fashion system that dominates today. A jacket from Valaclava and PlatformE Photographer: Lui Iarocheski     “Every single brand has overproduction, has overinventory, and obviously has end-of-season stock,” he says of the fashion industry at large. “So you start discounting, and that's a never-ending story. You see 90% discounts in outlets now. That depreciates the value of the brand.” He argues that by training shoppers to start virtual-first, all kinds of brands can nearly eliminate such end-of-season sales. Picture a virtual fashion show—an army of digital Gigi Hadids sashaying up and down a make-believe catwalk, kitted out in a variety of designs. Actual consumers could place orders from their screens, allowing the brand to physically produce only what's already been sold—instead of filling endless Zaras or Ralph Laurens with real garments to try on. Avatars will have sizing built in and can test out the outfits for their real-life counterparts. Or, if the outfit was only ever purchased for the avatar—like avirtual Gucci purse that sold in Mayfor more than the same bag in the real world—then these clothes may never have to be sewn at all. Now, read the second part of the article and summarize it in French, (take notes):     Matching:     To solve a problem, a code - distribution of profits - a legal right – to adopt - counterfeit goods/bootleg copy – scrap worth - internal to the company - who bids at an auction - involving a share of sales - nested, insert deeply     An in-house label= ................................................... .

Residuals=................................................... . A royalty fee= ................................................... . Revenue share= ................................................... . Why the Metaverse Is Fashion's Next Goldmine     Cruz is so committed to this idea that PlatformE is now going beyond its work with Kering and company to launch an in-house label, Valaclava. It will make its debut online, with items designed anonymously by artists and illustrators—some with fashion backgrounds, others with little experience in the field. The outfit you see on the virtual runway will sell as an NFT, which the highest bidder will own, much like a patent. The buyer won't receive a physical version of the garment, though they'll get all the technical information needed to have it made in the real world if they wish. Three hundred other shoppers will be able to buy real-world versions of the look without the NFT, because some people are still into that sort of thing. There's another reason luxury labels are rushing to embrace NFTs and virtual designs: the secondary and resale market, popularized by companies such as RealReal Inc. and Fashionphile Group LLC. The NFT setup lets the labels finally monetize a market they've long struggled to crack. NFTs assure authenticity, which discourages knockoffs, and can embed the equivalent of a sitcom actor's residuals in every luxury dress or bag. “Normally if something is sold [on a resale site] now, Hermès does not make a penny off that. But with digital items there's a huge opportunity for continued revenue when they're resold,” Hackl explains. All it takes is for the smart certificate or NFT to include a royalty fee or revenue share on future transactions, guaranteeing the original designer a percentage of whatever's paid. The Fabricant already operates like this on its creator-powered platform by taking a 5% royalty whenever a garment is resold after the first purchase. 4)Match the words from the article and their equivalent     blooming, developing - lack of coordination – banality - a physical store - promoted - to put on display/to show to advantage blatantly -     Clumsiness=................................................... .

mov_CB14AF1277187658CF3FBC906960F540,2025-07-14 16:58:54,fr,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Avec l'arrivée des beaux jours, une myriade de festivals s'apprête à pimenter les week-ends à venir jusqu'à la rentrée prochaine, sur tout le territoire français. Antidote offre ici un petit tour d'horizon des meilleurs d'entre eux, et a sélectionné les meilleurs looks disponibles sur le site de Zalando pour y assister. Les Eurockéennes : le plus éclectique Organisées depuis 1989 par l'association à but non lucratif Territoire de Musiques, sur le site naturel de la presqu'île de Malsaucy, près de Belfort, dans l'est de la France, les Eurockéennes se tiendront cette année du jeudi 29 juin au dimanche 2 juillet. Une fois n'est pas coutume, cette 33ème édition sera marquée par la nouveauté et un line-up éclectique, mettant en avant une grande diversité de styles musicaux et mélangeant artistes établi·e·s et émergeant·e·s. Cette année, plus de 80 % des artistes programmé·e·s se produiront d'ailleurs pour la première fois aux Eurockéennes. Répartis sur quatre jours et quatre scènes, les 52 concerts en plein air seront le fruit d'une programmation transversale et pointue. Le jeudi 29 juin, la rappeuse britannique Shygirl montera sur scène pour interpréter ses titres corrosifs aux connotations sexuelles explicites, tout comme le DJ Skrillex, qui faisait son retour en février dernier avec un nouvel album, ou encore le célèbre rappeur Niska. 070 Shake, Orelsan et Meryl seront quant à eux·elles à l'affiche du festival le lendemain, avant de passer le relai à Lomepal, Dinos, Pomme, Lous & The Yakuza, Kungs, Jeanne Added ou encore Vladimir Cauchermar le samedi 1er juillet. Puis le dimanche, le festival se clôturera avec un concert du groupe culte Indochine.  Ponctué par des mini-événements baptisés « Eurocks Special », mêlant danse contemporaine, shows musicaux de personnalités de la culture queer ou encore dancehall, ce festival éclectique mixant « grandes signatures internationales », « gars sûrs du hip-hop », « pop inspirée » et « électro énervée » sera parfait pour arborer un look aux accents rock et reflétant la grande diversité de styles et de labels disponibles sur Zalando.

Le Main Square Festival : le plus rap Prenant place chaque année dans le nord de la France, au sein de la citadelle d'Arras construite au XVIIème siècle par Vauban et classée au patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco, le Main Square Festival se tiendra du 30 juin au 2 juillet prochains. Pour cette 17ème édition, la programmation fera la part belle au rap et au hip-hop avec, parmi les plus grosses têtes d'affiches, les rappeurs belges Hamza et Damso, qui figurent sur le line-up au côté d'Orelsan, autre poids lourd du rap francophone. Tiakola et Macklemore seront également de la partie, tout comme Aya Nakamura, chanteuse francophone la plus écoutée dans le monde, qui ne manquera pas d'ambiancer les festivalier·ère·s avec ses toplines entêtantes. Organisé autour de trois scènes, la Main Stage, la Green Room et le Bastion, le Main Square Festival mettra autant en avant des stars internationales telles que David Guetta et Maroon 5, que des talents plus émergeants, tel·le·s que BBNO$ ou Cloud. Un line-up idéal pour se composer des looks aux accents street, infusés de l'esthétique Y2K, actuellement en plein revival. Les pièces du label Juicy Couture – dont les tracksuits en velours ornés de strass ont habillé Paris Hilton dans les années 2000 – seront ainsi un choix tout indiqué, et pourront être associées à des sneakers Nike ou New Balance, des bijoux audacieux et des lunettes de soleil iconiques, pour en prendre plein les yeux sans pour autant être aveuglé·e.

Lollapalooza : le plus huge Créé en 1991, le festival Lollapalooza a posé ses valises en France en 2017. Depuis, cinq éditions se sont succédées, avec des programmations toujours plus impressionnantes, réunissant des stars internationales telles que The Weeknd, Megan Thee Stallion ou encore A$AP Rocky. Planifié pour la première fois sur trois jours – au lieu de deux –, l'édition parisienne de ce festival également organisé à Chicago, Berlin, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Santiago et Stockholm promet d'être encore plus frénétique cette année, avec une soixantaine d'artistes au programme. Du 21 au 23 juillet, Rosalía, Kendrick Lamar, Aya Nakamura, Lil Nas X, Central Cee, Ava Max, Ckay ou encore Damso se succèderont sur scène à l'Hippodrome Paris Longchamp. Une volonté d'offrir le meilleur que l'événement transmet également aux festivalier·ère·s à travers son offre gustative, pensée une nouvelle fois par le chef étoilé Jean Imbert...."

Et pour cause : alors que certaines des plus grandes têtes d'affiches et quelques-uns des jeunes créateurs phares de la semaine de la mode new yorkaise (Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, Alexander Wang, Jeremy Scott, Pyer Moss ou encore Telfar Clemens) décidaient de délocaliser leur défilé à Londres ou Paris, ou passaient tout simplement leur tour cette saison, Tom Ford assénait un dernier coup de massue à New York en partant présenter sa collection à Los Angeles. Prise par celui qui est pourtant président du CFDA (Council of Fashion Designers of America), cette décision motivée par l'organisation deux jours plus tard des Oscars a suscité quelques vives critiques. Elle a cependant permis au créateur, qui faisait un clin d'œil au Los Angeles des années 70 à travers sa collection, de bénéficier de l'attractivité de la cérémonie. En témoigne l'armada de célébrités assises au premier rang : Jennifer Lopez, Miley Cyrus, Lil Nas X, Renée Zellweger, Tracee Ellis Ross, Demi Moore, Jason Momoa, Kate Hudson ou encore Jeff Bezos, PDG d'Amazon. Côté casting, Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid et Gigi Hadid défilaient devant la papesse de la mode américaine Anna Wintour, qui avait également fait le déplacement avant de regagner la côte est, de plus en plus délaissée.

mov_72986CA310AC3B29CFD8ABD43F4EE16C,2025-07-15 03:56:01,en,WEB,"  The biggest airport serving Italy's fashion capital of Milan has strengthened its high-end retail offer by introducing French heavyweights Dior and Louis Vuitton to anchor its luxury line-up with the largest boutiques at the gateway. Milan Malpensa Airport—which handled almost 30 million passengers last year, up 11%—is continuing its strategy of establishing itself as a premier European destination for high-end shopping. The operator, SEA Milan Airports, which also runs the smaller airport of Milan Linate, is stepping up its luxury offer in line with the city's rising popularity as a place to shop tax-free. According to tax refund specialist Global Blue, between December 2024 and February 2025), Milan accounted for 9% of total tax-free sales in Continental Europe with an average spend of €2,240 ($2,615), bettered only by Paris with a 22% share and average spending of €2,660 ($3,105). Both the Dior and Louis Vuitton boutiques are directly operated by the brands and have significant footprints at about 4,800 and 6,100 square feet, respectively. They take the number of luxury brands at Malpensa to 22, not including various corners and pop-ups within Avolta's large duty-free stores at the airport. The two new arrivals are strategically located in one of the most prominent areas of Terminal 1, and their eye-catching storefronts are now the first to be seen by passengers as they exit the security area into the retail spaces. Other big-name boutiques in T1 include Armani, Bottega Veneta, Burberry, Bulgari, Damiani, Hermès, Ferragamo, Moncler, Tod's and Zegna, many of them centered around a Davide Oldani Cafè. Luigi Battuello, chief commercial officer of SEA, commented: “With the arrival of Dior and Louis Vuitton, Malpensa cements its status as a benchmark for premium airport shopping. The investment by these iconic brands reflects our vision of an increasingly international, modern gateway—credible to partners and attentive to the needs of global travellers.” Milan lures global luxury shoppers Last year, T1 had the most international passengers of any SEA terminal and/or airports at 30%. European passengers accounted for 21%, North Americans 4%, and North Mediterranean Africa and the Middle East passengers, 2%. Intercontinental air traffic at Malpensa has been growing again and should support Dior and Louis Vuitton, both of which have been expanding at key hub airport like Qatar's Hamad International and others. In the first five months of 2025, luxury sales increased by a solid 18% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by the rise in high-spending international travelers. Average transaction value also rose by more than 9% year-over-year. This builds on an already strong 2024 for luxury, which was up a very healthy 21%. As with most airports in Europe, high-end retail sales drivers are non-European Union passengers, particularly from Asia and the Middle East. They account for over 80% of luxury purchases. T1 is, by far, the strongest terminal for non-EU customers. In 2024, across the SEA network (Malpensa and Linate combined), sales rose by 15% reaching record commercial revenue of €470 million ($550 million). Food and beverage ticked up higher at 16.6%. Malpensa has created a high-end commercial district at the airport, claiming to have a shopping experience “on par” with Milan's downtown Quadrilatero della Moda fashion district, where streets like Via Monte Napoleone are world famous and a magnet for luxury shoppers from all over the world. Global Blue ranks Milan ahead of Florence and Rome as the most strategic destination for international travel shopping in Italy. The fashion capital benefits from Italy's global reputation for fashion and craftsmanship, although this is being tarnished by scrutiny into alleged abuse of workers through subcontracting practices. Loro Piana, an LVMH house known for cashmere items, became the fifth high-end label in Italy to be put under judicial administration following investigations that started in 2023."

mov_3669BA82B1B3CD13C135502499F3F431,2025-07-15 06:00:49,en,WEB,"  LVMH shareholders have endured a torrid 2025 so far, with the French luxury group's stock market value sinking by a quarter over the last six months. The group, which counts Louis Vuitton, Dior and Givenchy among its stable of fashion brands, has seen shares sink by almost a third over the last 12 months as the global luxury rebound has probed sluggish. Last week Louis Vuitton announced it was targeted by a cyberattack for the third time in the past three months at the beginning of July, after Marks & Spencer, the Co-op and Harrods were all targeted earlier this year. Meanwhile, LVMH's drinks division, Moët Hennessy, is being gripped by a €1.3million court case brought by Maria Gasparovic, former chief of staff to executive Jean-Marc Lacave, who was sacked four months after reporting alleged sexual misconduct by senior colleagues. Despite these recent tribulations for the firm, analysts think shares could be due a rebound. LVMH revenues contracted 3 per cent to €20.3billion in the first quarter, from €20.7billion a year ago, well below analyst forecasts for sales growth of 2 per cent. Revenue in the firm's wines and spirits division, headed up by its Moët and Hennessy brands, declined 9 per cent to €1.3billion. Its largest category, fashion and leather goods, saw sales fall 5 per cent to €10.1billion, from €10.5billion previously. The firm, which was the first in its sector to post figures after the Donald Trump's 'liberation day' tariff announcements, said: 'In a disrupted geopolitical and economic environment, LVMH remains both vigilant and confident at the start of the year.' The French firm, which has a market capitalisation of almost €250billion, owns 75 luxury brands. It will publish its results for the first half of its 2025 financial year on 24 July. It isn't just LVMH that is feeling the pinch, the entire luxury sector is facing a similar downturn. After a post-pandemic peak that saw luxury brands surge on the back of huge demand, external pressures such as geopolitical uncertainty and economic slowdown have precipitated a downturn across the sector. During the course of 2024, the market dipped from €369billion to €364billion, according to figures from Bain & Company, with weaker demand, especially from China and the US, pushing the shrink. American luxury demand was down around 10 per cent in 2024 compared to its peak in 2022, according to data from Morningstar, while Chinese demand has slipped a quarter in compared with its pre-pandemic high point. Even so, LVMH has suffered a worse fate than many, with the firm underperforming luxury peers. Morningstar analysts said LVMH is currently trading below the broker's value estimate of €620 per share. At midday on Thursday, LVMH shares were trading at €496.05 per share. Since January, LVMH shares have fallen some 34 per cent, and was surpassed in value by Hermes, which became the largest luxury goods firm in April. Morningstar says this is a normalisation after the post pandemic boom, during which the firm said LVMH's valuation was stretched. At the time, LVMH was operating on a price to earnings ratio of 26. Now, having seen its share price half, its PE ratio on a one year rolling basis now stands at 20.2, according to figures form Stockopedia. In comparison, the new king of luxury, Hermes, is operating on a PE ratio of 50.8. Likewise, a number of other luxury goods firms have significantly larger PE ratios than LVMH, with Burberry standing at 48.2, EssilorLuxotica at 33.1 and Kering at 26.7. Jelena Sokolova, senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said: 'We have seen luxury sector slowdowns many times before, but this time LVMH's valuation has been unfairly hit. 'The retailer is trading at its lowest forward earnings multiple in seven years and roughly half that of comparable wide-moat peers, which presents an opportunity for investors.' Morningstar added: 'Forward earnings multiples are at the lowest for the last seven years and are meaningfully below peers, offering around 30 per cent upside to our fair value estimate.' However, others argue that LVMH's downturn is far from an unfair reflection on the rest of the business. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, however, told This is Money: 'LVMH has lost its sparkle after a series of setbacks in recent years. It has focused too much on the aspirational market and these types of buyers have become more cash-conscious, watching their pennies rather than opening their wallets without a care in the world. 'In contrast, Hermes has explicitly focused on the ultra-rich and has enjoyed more resilient trading. LVMH might now be thinking hard about narrowing its customer focus as that could help to make its products more desirable, which is ultimately what luxury goods is all about.' LVMH still has exceptional brand strength, which Morningstar says will give it the edge against its peers. The group's brands making up 29 per cent of the luxury leather market, compared to just 8 per cent for Hermes. The firm's impressive storefronts and higher capital spending on retail may help its brands to stand out from their competition. The strength of the brand remains, with LVMH having seen fashion and leather sales grow slightly better than the wider sector last year, though this dipped in the first quarter of 2025. Coatsworth, however, said: 'LVMH has too many different interests. We're in an environment where companies are focusing on what they do best and jettisoning non-core assets. LVMH would be better if it just focused on fashion and got rid of the Sephora and DFS retail arms and its various food and drink operations.' LVMH's brand strength, unwieldy though it may be, could combine with the potential for an upswing in the sector after the slowdown of the past few years. Morningstar's Sokolova certainly thinks this is the case. She told This is Money: 'We expect the luxury industry to return to growth after the current - and last year's - slowdown, driven by normalisation of demand in the US as post-pandemic excess spending is flushed out - a trend we've seen since 2023 - and as Chinese real estate prices stabilize, boosting consumer sentiment. ' LVMH derives around 24 per cent of its sales from the US, where consumer sending has also stalled. Morningstar said: 'We estimate that post-pandemic excesses have been flushed out of the market, US luxury consumption should come back to growth from more normal levels. We expect US GDP to hold up stronger in the long term.' China accounts for a significant portion of LVMH's sales, with Asia (excluding Japan), accounting for 30 per cent of LVMH sales. China's economy is currently in a period of slow growth, with consumers remaining tight on spending. In the first quarter, LVMH revenue from China fell by 11 per cent, with the second quarter expected to follow suit. Sokolova said: 'Many Chinese spenders are still sitting on substantial savings following the pandemic. We expect LVMH to outperform the industry growth longer-term thanks to strength of the brands and substantial marketing budget...."
wall-228186198_110,2025-07-15 08:33:49,ru,VK,"  SPR_COMBO[ru]⭐️Как провести ребрендинг и сделать всё правильно⭐️ Знаете, что общего у Tropicana, Gap и Jaguar? Все они неудачно провели ребрендинг, и их примеры теперь изучают в бизнес-школах, чтобы показать, как не надо делать. Например, Jaguar в апреле продал всего 49 машин по всему миру. А теперь вспомните, как изменились Burberry, Apple после возвращения Стива Джобса или недавно обновлённый KIA. Что они сделали хорошо? Всё дело в подходе. Давайте разберём, как правильно провести ребрендинг⬇ Шаг 1. Определите цель ребрендинга Начните с простого вопроса: зачем нам это нужно? Например, «логотип устарел» — это не причина. А вот «мы теряем больше 30% рынка среди молодёжи» — уже лучше. Компания Gap в 2010 году решила поменять свой знаменитый логотип на скучный Helvetica. Через неделю они вернули старый логотип из-за критики. Почему? Потому что не было чёткой цели. Шаг 2. Изучите свой бизнес Поговорите с сотрудниками, клиентами и даже теми, кто вас критикует. Проведите день в колл-центре или почитайте отзывы на Яндекс.Картах. Например, Airbnb провела 1000 интервью и поняла, что люди ищут не просто жильё, а чувство «дома». В результате они создали культовый символ Bélo и увеличили свою стоимость в несколько раз. Шаг 3. Определите проблемы Не просто «надо сделать дизайн лучше», а скажите, в чём именно проблема. Например, «клиенты не понимают, чем мы отличаемся от конкурентов» или «наш бренд ассоциируется с дешёвыми вещами, хотя продукт премиум». Old Spice столкнулся с тем, что их бренд не интересен миллениалам. Они решили эту проблему с помощью вирусной кампании с Терри Крузом. Шаг 4. Ищите вдохновение в разных местах Не ограничивайтесь своей отраслью. Например, Spotify вдохновлялся не музыкальными сервисами, а городской навигацией, поэтому у них такая динамичная айдентика. Шаг 5. Выберите креативное направление Instagram при ребрендинге выбирал между «ретро-камерой» и «окном в мир». Они выбрали второе, поэтому у них яркий радужный градиент и минималистичная иконка. Шаг 6. Создайте несколько концепций Сделайте минимум три варианта: безопасный, смелый и безумный. Uber тестировал 9 вариантов логотипа, прежде чем остановиться на текущем. Шаг 7. Проверьте всё в разных условиях Как новый логотип будет выглядеть на тёмной теме iPhone? А на наружной рекламе? А в вертикальных сторис? Команда Slack потратила месяцы, тестируя новый логотип в разных контекстах. Старый логотип терялся на цветных фонах, а новый хорошо виден везде. Шаг 8. Запускайтесь правильно..."

Stylist's own shirt and suspenders. Photo: Nadia Lee Cohen This article was featured in One Great Story, New York's reading-recommendation newsletter. Sign up here to get it nightly. Originally published on September 4, 2024, this story is being recirculated on the occasion of Chloë Sevigny's Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited or Anthology Series or Movie (for Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story). As she enters the deserted tea shop in Soho, Chloë Sevigny is carrying a large cardboard box containing vintage Margiela boots from the RealReal, a giant pink neoprene tote, and a boxy black Loewe purse. Her long beachy-yellow hair is down under a CANNES '69 ball cap, and her crisp sky-blue oxford is buttoned all the way up over black hot pants so short you can't see them under the shirt. She's wearing really, truly, absolutely no makeup. She'd be camera-ready except her eyes — red-rimmed with incipient tears — are a dead giveaway that something isn't right. “I dropped the kid at camp, crying, screaming he didn't want to go in,” she says as she settles onto the stool next to mine at the counter. “So it was very challenging, part of why I'm crying.” Then she had walked back the ten or so blocks to her under-renovation apartment (she's combining it with the unit next door) to drop off some checks for the contractors and pick up the package she's now carrying, then back to this café, which is near where she started. Her husband, the gallerist Siniša Mackovic, is currently out of town at an art fair, so she's been solo parenting. She orders a matcha with extra hot water, and when it comes, she seems immediately restored by the tea the way characters in old British novels are. She cradles the cup in her palms and sits with her endless legs primly crossed. “Okay,” she says. “So what are the questions?” The morning up till now disappears. Chloë Sevigny has arrived at work. In This Issue Chloë Sevigny See All For more than 30 years, Sevigny has represented the height of downtown cool, but since Vanja was born in 2020, she's also become a working mom who gets emotional when her toddler clings to her leg at drop-off. It's somewhat surreal to see her struggle with the same things that I and every mom I know have been working through. But as she tells me about life with Vanja and the next stage she's envisioning for her career, she sounds just like herself. Her fall schedule is packed. “I have a film, Bonjour Tristesse, going to Toronto, so I go to the Toronto Film Festival for a couple of days, and then Monsters” — the new installment of the Ryan Murphy series, in which she plays Kitty Menendez — “comes out, so we do some promotion for that. There's a premiere in L.A. and then press in New York and then Charli XCX is playing at Madison Square Garden. And then I think I have a fashion requirement — going to a show in Paris.” After that, in November, she'll turn 50. “And hopefully nothing big comes along and I can start really focusing on one of the features” — three films she wants to direct — “really full-tilt boogie.” Her hope is that by the time her birthday rolls around, a new era in her career will open up, one in which she'll get to spend more time behind the camera than in front of it. She has directed short films but never a full-length feature. She's been conceptualizing these three films since the pre-pandemic, pre-baby era of her life. It'll be a huge change to work on a project where she's the boss. SAINT LAURENT BY ANTHONY VACCARELLO Double-Breasted Blazer, Shirt, Wide Tie, Wide-Leg Trouser, and Jean Derby, at ysl.com. Photo: Nadia Lee Cohen Photo: Nadia Lee Cohen The day after our interview, she's planning to fly to London with Vanja to shoot Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt, in which she stars with Andrew Garfield, Julia Roberts, and Ayo Edebiri. She tells me the film is set at Yale and centers on a student's accusations of inappropriate behavior by a professor. Sevigny plays a psychologist. She arranged for her babysitter, who's currently in London stocking a hotel room with Vanja's favorite snacks from Whole Foods, to have a small role in the movie, so she'll have her child with her on set for some scenes. The daily drop-offs during this clingy phase have been so wrenching that sometimes Sevigny just gives up and lets Vanja tag along to wherever she's going, which this week included a photo shoot for this magazine. “He's a good set baby,” she says. “He is very quiet — he realizes that if he wants to make noise, he has to go outside.” And for Sevigny, emotionally, it's easier just to bring him. “I almost like it better having him there and then I feel less guilty about being at work.” Sevigny describes her parenting style as “still skin-to-skin.”..."

Love them or hate them, bucket hats are back, and the latest spike in sales (up 89 per cent in the last three months, according to Klarna) can be squarely attributed to Manchester's most famous and freshly reconciled brothers, the Gallaghers. Oasis have kicked off their Live '25 tour, and if dispatches from the Cardiff and Manchester shows are anything to go by, the London dates are set to be pure gold. Naturally, the Britpop poster boys' reunion has sparked a new clamour for all things Nineties fashion, from Harrington jackets to vintage football shirts. Searching for a way to buy into the scene without looking like an extra from Kevin & Perry Go Large? A bucket hat is the ultimate accessory. Originally designed for farmers and fishermen, the practical headwear made its way into pop culture via the hip-hop scene in the 80s and 90s, when the likes of LL Cool J and Run-DMC sported the look. It wasn't long before scores of bucket hats began popping up at British festivals, attendees no doubt drawn to their waterproof and sun-shading qualities - who doesn't have trust issues when it comes to summer weather? - plus their ability to mask greasy, unwashed hair and roll up tightly in a backpack without destroying the design. For those who were there the first time around, peak-Nineties Liam was the frontman snarling into a mic from under the brim of a bucket hat. Kangol was generally the brand of choice then, but luxe labels have since cottoned on with versions more boujee than budget. Dior, Burberry, Jacquemus and Louis Vuitton all offer bucket hats in their current collections, making the once-agricultural accessory fit for the A-list (with prices to match). Those without the requisite deep pockets will still strike gold on the high street - Nike, adidas, Urban Outfitters and more offer bucket hats at less Supersonic prices. If you're looking for a way to look and feel Nineties nostalgia, we've got the best options by the, ahem, bucket load. From high street to high end, find the best bucket hats to wear to Oasis or your next festival below. Shop now Adidas Originals Tour Bucket Hat Simple and in a foolproof black and white colourway, adidas' Oasis bucket hat nails the brief. There's only limited online stock, so if you want it to complete your gig outfit, you'd better be quick. Kangol Cotton Stripe Bucket Hat Make like LG in this light blue Kangol number, featuring a contrast stripe and matching brand motif. It's completely made from cotton and will need to be hand-washed to keep clean. Get it in small and large sizes. Stone Island Bucket hat with mesh lining and compass embroidery A functional name for a functional accessory, Stone Island keeps its bucket nice and streamlined. While it's available in black, navy and shades of green, this metallic silver will pop in pre-gig group photos. iets frans... Brown Check Bucket Hat For less than a tenner, there's no reason not to jump on the bucket hat bandwagon yourself. Available exclusively at Urban Outfitters, this checked design feels timeless and is on sale right now - it was: £24. Don't let it slide away. AllSaints Skye Bucket Hat Your new festival favourite, AllSaints washed denim look nails the Nineties brief. Pair with hoops and smudged eyeliner for an instant cool girl look. JiaTL WeyJia Women's Bucket Hat Crochet comes into its own in the summer, but the look isn't just for the beach. This option, crafted from four rolls of milk cotton yarn, is soft to the touch and breathable, making it perfect for when you're jumping around, sweaty and singing. It comes in a range of colourways, but we like the classic monochrome best. Coach Signature Jacquard Bucket Hat Want to make greener fashion choices? Head to Coach's outlet website, where you can pick up this cute bucket hat, made from 71 per cent recycled polyester and 29 per cent regenerative cotton. Available in two sizes. Jacquemus The Gadjo Bucket Hat Pay tribute to Kangol's OG baby blue design with this souped-up version, courtesy of Jacquemus. It comes in four colours and three sizes with a knotted detail on the reverse. CK Jeans Embroidered Monogram Bucket Hat CK One was one of the best-selling fragrances of the Nineties, with unisex appeal...."

You're about to get stopped every 5 seconds when you debut this shirt at your local mall. GiftingPress is a small business based in North Carolina that specializes in customized mugs and shirts. Promising review: ""Kayla was very sweet and kept me informed every step of the way! This was a birthday gift for my sister, and she absolutely loved it!! Thank you Kayla ."" —Tammy Get it from GiftingPress on Etsy for $13.10+ (originally $26.20+; available in women's sizes S—4XL and five colors). 2. A nursing scarf with a magnetic snap mechanism so you can feed your little one in absolute style. Drape this scarf around your neck, or keep it on hand, decorating your diaper bag, so you can nurse your baby absolutely anywhere without fear of it ruining your perfect look. Say hello to one of my new favorite parenting products!! As a breastfeeding mom, with a baby who is always looking to feed, I'm constantly finding myself either nursing or pumping in public. The previous covers I was using were both as conspicuous as they were... shall we say... not the prettiest?? I was also always worried that the previous cover I had was not providing the proper coverage I needed. And then I got this scarf. It has a magnetic snap design that keeps the scarf secure around my neck, so I don't need to worry about my daughter snatching the cover off me. It's deceptively large and covers absolutely what it needs to! Plus, it's So. Freaking. Pretty!!! Finally, a mom necessity that actually elevates my outfit instead of ruining it! It's the perfect accessory — I keep it around the handle of my diaper bag because it looks beautiful there, and it ensures that I always have it on hand. I even took it on a few trips, and I've gotten a ton of compliments every time I use it. It's literally motherhood made chic. Promising review: ""I'm genuinely in love! I've had my eye on this scarf for a while and decided to buy it for myself for Mother's Day. We spent the day by a trendy pool in Hollywood with my 2-month-old baby, and it was such a great accessory. I was able to comfortably breastfeed throughout the day while looking chic. I love how soft and light it is while offering the perfect amount of coverage."" —Hana L. Get it from Piolina for $82 (available in three colors). 3.

1m11sfg,2025-07-16 03:05:13,en,REDDIT,"  Hey everyone, new to this sub but it's so cool hearing all of your stories! I am an older student, female, early 30s, originally from Europe and moved to the US last year and now should be getting my approved green card in the next couple of weeks. I did a few months of college back when I was 19 but decided to leave due to dealing with some family trauma and needed a few years to find myself, did a few years of travelling before getting into a corporate career and have been a successful executive assistant to C suite at some fortune 500 companies for the last 7 years (Burberry, Netflix, etc). Honestly going to a US school was always my dream, but financially was not an option for me when I was that age. Not having a degree has always been something I'm a little embarrassed about, I'm a pretty ferocious reader and have really keen interests in history, politics and literature. Have been contemplating going back and looking into the community college to transfer process where I live (southern california) and it honestly looks like California community colleges have pretty good transfer rates if you really invest and keep up a high GPA. I was wondering if anyone on this sub has a similar story of being out of education for a while (over 10 years) and going back through the CC to transfer route? I'm excited to go back, but every story I see seems to be super exceptional, professional dancers, vets, successful entrepeneurs and it would be so good to see if there is anyone that had a more 'normal job' before going back to school! Would be looking to eventually major in English, History or maybe Political Science (though I also loveeee biology and would love to get some science classes in too!) Dreams of an ivy league, but not sure how realistic it would be, and would just be thrilled to go from community college to a good 4 year school."

La empresa de moda de lujo ha iniciado una colaboración con The Standard, un hotel ubicado en el corazón de la ciudad, en la que ha redecorado su azotea con elementos vinculados a la identidad de marca. Hasta octubre, el espacio superior del hotel estará revestido con la estética de Burberry reinterpretando en amarillo cálido, presentes en sombrillas, tumbonas y cojines. El logotipo de la firma preside en el fondo de la piscina, mientras que en el vestíbulo se ha instalado un fotomatón con el mismo diseño. La experiencia también incluye un pop up de productos, con prendas y accesorios de temporada como bañadores, bolsos, gafas de sol o calzado, disponibles para comprarlos en el hotel. A esto se suman sesiones semanales de coctelería en el bar Up junto con Djs invitados. Desde las alturas del hotel, se puede ver el Check Mate, un barco de la marca que navega por la costa de Ibiza con los códigos gráficos del universo Burberry. Burberry lleva su estampado icónico al corazón de Ibiza con una experiencia vacacional Publicidad La firma pretende consolidar su presencia experiencial en destinos clave a través de cultura musical, un alto estilo de vida y la inclusión de la moda en el mundo del ocio. Estas iniciativas se suman a la última campaña lanzada titulada Festival que festeja la herencia británica de la firma con embajadores como Liam Gallagher, Cara Delevingne o Alexa Chung. “Burberry se sitúa en el centro del calendario de verano y al mismo tiempo es un medio de expresión creativa y el uniforme predilecto de los asistentes a los festivales”, ha afirmado el director creativo de la firma Daniel Lee. La acción en Ibiza sigue otra colaboración con The Newt, una finca con un hotel y spa de lujo en Somerset, Inglaterra. En ella, la firma ha rediseñado elementos visuales y mobiliario de las instalaciones con una versión personalizada de su estampado para homenajear la artesanía, el estilo y las actividades al aire libre del legado británico. En su último ejercicio (finalizado el 29 de marzo), Burberry ha logrado un beneficio operativo de 26 millones de libras (30,9 millones de euros). Sin embargo, la facturación se ha desplomado un 17%, hasta 2.461 millones de libras (2.874 millones de euros), mientras que las ventas comparables lo han hecho un 12%. A pesar de ello, la compañía ha conseguido superar las previsiones del mercado y cerrar el segundo semestre en positivo."
movFt_6AA76969F01D3B6894F836BA9CCB6FBB,2025-07-16 04:00:24,en,WEB,"  Browsing one-star reviews on Trustpilot is a great way to experience vicarious outrage on behalf of overcharged or underserved customers. Going by its own pricey valuation, though, shareholders are awarding the online reviewer the full five stars. Value depends on perspective — or geography, in this case — but a more moderate rating would give an untested model some leeway. Shares in Trustpilot, which produced its first net profit last year, surged as much as 13 per cent on Tuesday after a trading update beat expectations and led the group to forecast a 14 per cent full-year ebitda margin, up from just over 11 per cent, if stock option costs and one-offs for transactions and restructuring are taken out. The gains pushed its shares back above the 265p price at which it went public in 2021, and nudged its market value over $1bn. It also drove the share price to the equivalent of more than 70 times this year's forecast earnings per share, and a punchy 54 times forecasts for 2027. Trustpilot makes its money from selling companies a tiered ability to monitor and interact with their customers' reviews on its site. Its value lies in its independence: consumers give their reviews freely and use the site to check out companies. For small enterprises, a good rating helps build credibility. For the largest, Trustpilot offers data analytics while its rating can help managers push a customer service ethos. Google and Amazon are the competitors that spring to mind, but for each, ratings form a small part of other offerings, be that maps or a marketplace. How to value the company? Consider it a middling if up-and-coming member of the FTSE 250, and a multiple of 70 puts it head and shoulders above any other mid-cap stock. The next highest are Raspberry Pi, maker of tiny computers, and designer Burberry, both with 40-something multiples. More comparable companies, such as property portal Rightmove or software provider Sage, trade on 26 times, though both can also be considered mature businesses. US investors make up about two-fifths of Trustpilot's investor base, roughly double their presence a year ago, which may help explain the optimistic pricing. Rank Trustpilot among US companies offering subscription software services, and its valuation sits towards the middle, albeit in a range that runs from multiples of more than 200 for data analytics group Palantir Technologies, down to 20 times for customer relationship enabler Salesforce. Markets work, like customer review aggregators, because contributors have different opinions and must meet in the middle. Seen from the US, Trustpilot's rating — meaning its valuation — looks more like a three-star affair. The company shows no sign of wanting to ship its listing across the Atlantic. But as its users know, those unsatisfied with the service they are getting can always take their business elsewhere. jennifer.hughes@ft.com"

Some afforable Eos Shea Butter Vanilla Cashmere body lotion that TikTokers are tripping over themselves to get as they swear it moisturizes and smells as good as much more expensive options from brands like Philosophy and Bath & Body Works. Promising reviews: ""I first saw this lotion on TikTok; an influencer was bragging about it! Let me tell you, she did not lie. This lotion is the BEST. It smells fantastic. A cross between cotton candy and vanilla, it's just so fresh. It makes my skin smooth all day. This large bottle will last me a couple of months. Thank you, Eos, for such a fantastic lotion.  "" —Erin ""Very similar to my Burberry fragrance, and they layer beautifully. I always get tons of compliments on the scent. I also purchase the jasmine and berry  for a more fruity option but to me it just smells like regular lotion. Cost per use is well worth it considering how thick the lotion is. It also actually moisturizes while leaving a fragrance behind instead of drying my skin out due to the perfume. I have sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions."" —Violet Frahm Get it from Amazon for $9.97 (available in various scents and packs). 2. A tube of Essence's Lash Princess Mascara to give you a falsies-level look for less than five bucks. It seems questionable, I know, but for confirmation, you need only look at the 262,000+ 5-star reviews!! Promising review: ""After using Lights, Camera, Lashes by Tarte for the past year, I got tired of breaking the bank over mascara. My sister suggested Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect and I IMMEDIATELY fell in love. It provides dramatic length and great volume. I can honestly say I can't stop looking at my eyelashes in the mirror every single day because of how awesome they look. Also, it is very long-wearing. I go from an eight-hour workday right to the gym and sweat [a lot]. . and this stuff doesn't budge! I love it!!"" —Carrie E Weikert Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (available in black or brown and as a three-pack). 3. A long-sleeve bodysuit in a deliciously soft fabric — known as Smoke Cloud — that reviewers compare to Skims. They say it washes well, too, so you can count on it being high quality despite the deceivingly low price! And BTW, reviewers say the double lining in the torso is supportive, so they don't need to wear a bra. Promising review: ""Are you kidding me? This is the softest, most comfortable body suit I've ever owned. I got so many compliments lol; everyone did think they were Skims lol, but it's definitely worth every penny. I love and will be getting more colors!!! You need it."" —Wendy L. Get it from Amazon for $28.99 (available in women's sizes XS–3X and 13 colors). And check out all the styles available in the Smoke Cloud fabric here. 4. Elizavecca's Collagen Coating Hair Protein Treatment — it works just like a hair mask to repair your locks in five minutes flat. The ceramide 3- and collagen-packed formula repairs all types of hair, whether you've got over-processed tresses or 4c hair that's susceptible to dryness. Reviewers even say the $8 product is comparable to Olaplex No. 3!..."

mov_856DC85870CB3AE9945ED6B83F69C219,2025-07-16 14:43:52,en,WEB,"  The year 2025 has proven to be an extremely difficult one for fashion, which finds itself crushed by socio-economic pressures on all fronts, luxury included. Nonetheless, while major companies like Burberry are forced to make staff cuts, CEOs are doing better than ever. According to a new report from WWD, out of 50 executive leaders working in the fashion sector, 25 have recorded salary increases of at least $10 million in the past year. And that's just in America. Among the brands with the best-paid CEOs, according to the publication, are David Simon of Simon Property Group, one of the largest mall owners in the country, who received an annual salary of $61 million, followed by Doug Herrington of Amazon, Doug McMillon of Walmart, and Ralph Lauren of his namesake brand, who received a compensation package worth $24.1 million. Based on last year's data, in 2024 the 25 highest-paid CEOs in American fashion received salary increases amounting to 23.5%. Even though CEOs bear great responsibilities, the steep salary increases they secured in the past year are hard to justify. And while it's true that they're not actually paid in dollars but in stock and option awards depending on business goals (not only their own, of course), it's certainly not the case that what they earned before wasn't enough. Let's return to the example of Burberry's CEO to show how unnecessary these bonuses may be: on top of a substantial salary (almost £2.6 million, which seems small compared to the Americans), the new Burberry CEO received £380,000 for the relocation, £135,000 to find a new home, £120,000 for the move from New York, and five months of fully paid housing allowance, according to the Guardian. In a sensitive time like this, when artisans in fashion districts are on strike because they don't feel respected, and the entire apparel and accessories market shows serious signs of collapse, where changes in creative leadership make brands' futures even more uncertain, the news of CEO salary increases makes the luxury sector seem truly out of touch—though it's always been that way."
mov_22EEE79C77A828FFA277D5992CBD92DA,2025-07-16 15:16:57,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Suki Waterhouse, actriz, cantante y pareja del actor Robert Pattinson, rompió el silencio sobre su reciente desaparición de redes sociales... ¡y lo hizo con mucho estilo! A través de su cuenta de X (antes Twitter), contó con humor que había estado hospitalizada por una hernia causada por usar pantalones extremadamente ajustados. “'Suki, ya no tuiteas'... ¿Sabías que hace seis meses usé unos pantalones tan apretados que me causaron una hernia y tuve demasiado miedo de decírtelo?” , escribió junto a una fotografía suya desde la cama del hospital y otra sobre el escenario, donde luce los infames pantalones verdes que habrían sido los culpables. El contraste de las imágenes causó furor. Mira: Muere cantante argentina a los 36 años que padecía cáncer; ¡afirmaba curarse con la música! ¿Qué es una hernia y cómo puede causarla la ropa apretada? Aunque suene como algo que solo pasa en Hollywood, el caso de la cantante britanica Suki puso bajo los reflectores un tema poco discutido: los efectos de la ropa ajustada en la salud. Una hernia ocurre cuando parte del intestino o tejido sobresale a través de un punto débil en los músculos abdominales, y aunque no es común que la ropa apretada lo cause directamente, sí puede agravar una condición preexistente. La Clínica Mayo señala que la presión constante sobre la zona abdominal, como la ejercida por jeans ceñidos o cinturones muy ajustados, podría complicar cuadros médicos latentes o impedir una correcta presión intraabdominal. En casos extremos, como el de Suki, la estética puede terminar pasando una factura bastante alta. Lee: Muere famosa cantante de ska tras ser diagnosticada con cáncer; así confirmaron su partida: “No fue fácil” ¿Cómo reaccionaron sus fans tras la confesión viral de Suki Waterhouse, la famosa cantante? La revelación no solo sorprendió por lo peculiar del motivo, sino por la manera en que Waterhouse lo compartió. Las redes estallaron con comentarios como: “En el escenario con pantalones de cuero y luego conectada a un suero en el hospital, como una verdadera estrella de rock”. Su honestidad fue aplaudida por miles de seguidores, quienes valoraron que hablara abiertamente de un problema de salud sin caer en dramatismos. Su actitud relajada pero directa logró que se abriera un debate sobre los peligros de anteponer la moda al bienestar físico. ¿Podría afectar la hernia la carrera o gira musical de Suki Waterhouse? Hasta el momento, la famosa cantante no ha confirmado si tendrá que hacer ajustes a su calendario de presentaciones, pero todo indica que su recuperación va avanzando. En general, las hernias inguinales pueden requerir cirugía o reposo prolongado, lo que podría afectar actividades físicas intensas. Para alguien como Suki, que constantemente está en conciertos, alfombras rojas y grabaciones, esto podría significar un cambio temporal de ritmo. Sin embargo, su actitud positiva sugiere que seguirá adelante con su carrera, ahora con ropa un poco más holgada. Mira: Esta famosa actriz y cantante mexicana de las décadas de los 60 y 70 ¡actualmente vive en la calle! Así luce ¿Quién es Suki Waterhouse la cantante que fue a dar al hospital por una hernia? Suki Waterhouse nació en Londres en 1992 y comenzó su carrera como modelo a los 16 años, trabajando para firmas como Burberry, Redken y Tommy Hilfiger. Su transición a la actuación fue igual de exitosa, con participaciones en películas como Love, Rosie, Insurgent y más recientemente, la serie de Amazon Prime Daisy Jones & The Six. En el terreno musical, ha lanzado dos álbumes: I Can't Let Go y Memoir of a Sparklemuffin (2024), consolidándose como una artista versátil. Su relación con Robert Pattinson la ha convertido en un foco constante de los medios de espectáculos. Ambos están juntos desde 2018 y en 2024 le dieron la bienvenida a su primera hija."

We grew up poor, but she hardly ever even cooked meals, I cooked myself ramen noodles or popcorn all the time. She would let dishes rot and mold.

But make no mistake — they care deeply about what your brand stands for. The difference? They read it through your design. Your typeface. Your visual tone. Instantly. The smartest brands in the world know this. That's why they've radically overhauled their logos, typography, and identities — not to erase history, but to express it in a modern, mobile-native way. Here are six iconic brands that updated their logos between 2023 and 2025 to speak Gen Z fluently: Jaguar (2024) Out with the “growler.” In with a sleek, angular leaper and mixed-case logotype framed by 16 sharp lines. Electric, premium, digital. Bentley Motors, Inc. - Americas Region (2025) Refined the Winged B — feathers gone, falcon-inspired diamond wings in. Minimalism meets mobile-first prestige. Burberry (2023) Ditching Helvetica for a curled serif and reviving the Equestrian Knight. Heritage reimagined for digital storytelling. Amazon (2025) Rolled out “Ember Modern” — a warm, unified, custom typeface across all sub-brands. Approachable, consistent, scalable design. Moët & Chandon (2023) Modernized its crest with a clean badge, updated crown, and simplified luxury palette. The past, distilled into elegance and structure. Liquid Death (2024) A water brand wrapped in gothic fonts, heavy-metal energy, and irreverent meme culture. Hydration with attitude — and 3.7 million Gen Z followers to prove it. This is not about aesthetics. It's about story clarity. Gen Z wants to know who you are — but you've got 2 seconds, no sound, and 100px to say it. Your design is your narrative. And if your logo can't speak clearly, you're not part of the conversation. John Parrino AlcamoHospitality.com"

乱寄保健品和药品：英国的维生素、感冒药虽常见，但像含麻黄碱的止咳药、带动物成分的保健品，都是海关明令禁止的，之前帮朋友寄的某品牌止咳糖浆，直接被扣留销毁了。 忽略行李重量限制：英国快递对包裹重量卡得严，比如皇家邮政超过2kg就要加费，之前一个箱子超重300g，多花了20英镑，太不划算！ 打包时最好自己称好重。 毕业季扎堆寄：6-8月是英国寄行李高峰，海运仓位紧张，运费会涨30%左右，还容易延误。 建议提前1个月寄，或者错峰到9月之后，性价比更高。 英国寄件实用流程
📦 打包技巧：

乱寄保健品和药品：英国的维生素、感冒药虽常见，但像含麻黄碱的止咳药、带动物成分的保健品，都是海关明令禁止的，之前帮朋友寄的某品牌止咳糖浆，直接被扣留销毁了。 忽略行李重量限制：英国快递对包裹重量卡得严，比如皇家邮政超过2kg就要加费，之前一个箱子超重300g，多花了20英镑，太不划算！ 打包时最好自己称好重。 毕业季扎堆寄：6-8月是英国寄行李高峰，海运仓位紧张，运费会涨30%左右，还容易延误。 建议提前1个月寄，或者错峰到9月之后，性价比更高。 英国寄件实用流程

mov_BC5520BE086DF8B289EE9BD9104520B6,2025-07-17 10:03:44,en,WEB,"  A “challenging” luxury market and retreat from gaming have prompted a fall in sales and profits at Mike Ashley's Frasers. The group, which is majority owned by the billionaire former Newcastle United owner, said sales fell 7.4% to £4.7bn and pre-tax profits slid 24% to £379.5m as it closed some of its House of Fraser department stores and Game video game shops. Sales in its 'premium lifestyle' division, which includes Flannels, House of Fraser and brands such as Pretty Green bought from JD Sports, slumped almost 15% as it said “the luxury market continued to be challenging”, although Frasers said it was “now showing some early signs of improvement”. Many luxury businesses, including the UK's Burberry and Mulberry, have struggled amid a slowdown in spending by aspirational shoppers. That group of consumers, who typically treat themselves to an occasional luxury fashion item, have seen their budgets constrained by high interest rates, increased household bills and rising prices. Related: The rise in unemployment shows the UK jobs market is cooling, but it is not collapsing Despite the problems, Frasers said its “long-term ambitions for the luxury business remain unchanged” and it had consolidated its store estate to “further strengthen our position”. The FTSE 250 listed group said that after “an especially weak period” in the wake of last October's budget, “UK consumer confidence and trading conditions improved into 2025, and recent sales trends have been more encouraging”. Adjusted profits rose 2.8% to £560m, it said. It is expecting underlying profits similar to this year as it said it was working to offset at least £50m of additional costs linked to changes made in the budget, including an increase in employers' national insurance contributions. The changes, introduced in April, have already provoked a backlash from business groups against the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, who is widely expected to be forced to raise taxes again in her autumn budget. Related: Jaguar Land Rover to axe 500 UK management jobs as Trump tariffs fallout dents sales Frasers said it would continue to invest in improving the image of its Sports Direct chain, which had a rise in sales. This improvement, however, was offset by closures of its Game video games outlets and falling sales at its Studio Retail online business, leading to an overall fall of 7.2% in Frasers' sports division. The company said it was investing in Sports Direct with a “significant recent step up in international expansion”. It continued to open outlets for its Flannels luxury streetwear chain, including in Leeds and Sheffield. Michael Murray, the chief executive of Frasers, said: “We accelerated our international expansion, announcing partnerships in Australia, Asia and [the Middle East and Europe], to further build Sports Direct into a truly worldwide proposition. “Our relationships with the world's best global brands, including Nike, Adidas and Hugo Boss, are the strongest they have ever been, and our ambitious growth plans are now strengthening and scaling these partnerships even further.”"

Meet them all, including her current rumored relationship with Brandon Green. View gallery Image Credit: Getty Images At just the age of 11, Emma Watson cemented her spot in the pop culture zeitgeist due to her role as Hermione Granger, the quick witted and precocious witch in the Harry Potter film franchise. The actress and activist, 31, has made a name for herself since the debut of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. She has gone on to star in other notable film projects, including The Bling Ring, Beauty and the Beast, and Little Women. With a high-profile career comes high-profile relationships, but Emma has made it a point to keep her personal life as far away from the spotlight as possible. Below, look back at Emma's past boyfriends and relationships. Francis Boulle Emma and Francis, an English diamond heir and entrepreneur who starred in the reality series Made in Chelsea, were briefly linked in 2008. He told Heat in 2011 that he broke things off because he wanted to achieve his “own notoriety,” saying, “I have always been an ambitious person and I want to achieve my own notoriety for what I've done. That's why I chose not to pursue it any longer, because I didn't want to be the boyfriend of some child actress.” He called Emma a “really cool person.” Jay Barrymore Emma and Jay, an English financier, dated between 2008 and 2009. They reportedly split due to the long distance: Emma attended college at Brown University in the States at the time, while Jay lived in the United Kingdom. “The transatlantic gap proved too much for their relationship to survive,” a source told Irish Examiner. Rafael Cebrián Emma and Rafael, a Spanish musician and actor, dated between late 2009 and 2010 after meeting at Brown. They were first spotted at the hockey game between the Florida Panthers and New York Rangers in New York in November 2009. George Craig Emma and George, an English singer and model, were briefly linked in 2010. They met on set of a Burberry campaign. The Harry Potter actress even starred in the music video for his band, One Night Only, for the song “Say You Don't Want It” that year. Johnny Simmons Emma and Johnny, an American actor who starred opposite the actress in The Perks of Being a Wallflower, briefly dated in 2011, a year before the film came out. The two were spotted kissing outside of restaurant in Santa Monica in August of that year. “They have really fallen for one another and both aren't dating anyone else,” a source told Hollywood Life at the time. Will Adamowicz Emma and Will, a fellow student she met when she attended the University of Oxford in England, dated between late 2011 and 2013. They were first spotted kissing at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in 2012. The actress' rep confirmed to multiple outlets in 2014 that they called it quits and were “no longer in touch.” Matthew Janney Emma and Matthew, a fellow student at Oxford and rugby player, dated for nearly a year in 2014. In the September 2015 issue of British Vogue, Emma called the split “horrendous,” revealing she went on a weeklong silent retreat to figure out how to be single. “I felt really uncomfortable,” she said. “Even before my relationship ended, I went on a silent retreat, because I really wanted to figure out how to be at home with myself.” Roberto Aguire Emma and Roberto, an actor known for his roles in Pretty Little Liars and NCIS: New Orleans, were briefly linked in 2015. The longtime friends met on set of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, where Roberto interned in the special effects department, he previously revealed to JustJared. He called Emma “one of my best friends.” William “Mack” Knight Emma and William, a tech entrepreneur who worked in Silicon Valley, dated between 2015 and 2017, keeping the relationship low key. In her March 2017 cover story for Vanity Fair, Emma explained why she wouldn't speak publicly about her boyfriend. “I want to be consistent: I can't talk about my boyfriend in an interview and then expect people not to take paparazzi pictures of me walking around outside my home,” she said. “You can't have it both ways. I've noticed, in Hollywood, who you're dating gets tied up into your film promotion and becomes part of the performance and the circus. I would hate anyone that I were with to feel like they were in any way part of a show or an act.”..."

From his humble beginnings in Jamaica to coordinating productions for some of the world's most iconic brands, Patrick has carved out a remarkable career as a camera operator and director in the fast-paced world of television production. He was recently promoted to the role of global talent coordinator at the London-based Dreamtek TV, a company which was established in 1999, that specialises in video production, and has offices in New York City, and Singapore. Patrick is the sole Jamaican employed at the company. His journey began after he graduated from high school, where he studied film at the Creative Production and Training Centre (CPTC) on Arnold Road in Kingston. Germaine Patrick He then took his first steps in media working with Hype TV, RE-TV, Television Jamaica and then at Sportsmax. “As a freelancer, I wanted to make a name for myself because I have a sharp eye for visuals and an unrelenting work ethic. This has taken me far beyond the Caribbean shores, as traveling opportunities came along which included the United States, the Caribbean and eventually in Europe. I have also lent my expertise to a diverse range of projects spanning in entertainment, sports, documentaries, corporate content, news and infomercials,” Patrick told Observer Online on Wednesday. He continued, “I always believed in the power of storytelling, no matter the platform or the audience. That belief has brought me across continents and into the heart of some of the world's most dynamic media environments.” Upon migrating to the United Kingdom, his career entered a new chapter. He worked with renowned broadcasters such as CNN London and Warner Bros, further cementing his reputation as a trusted professional in the field. His role at Dreamtek TV marked a significant evolution—not only working behind the camera but also stepping into a leadership role as a production coordinator. Here, he orchestrated complex, global productions for clients like Facebook, Google, Burberry, Spotify, and Bentley, managing logistics, crews, and creative direction with precision. One of the highlights of his career came during the BET Awards in 2008 and 2009, where he worked on the red carpet interviewing legendary figures including Joe Jackson, the father of Michael Jackson, as well as superstars like Beyoncé, Busta Rhymes, P Diddy, Master P, Mariah Carey and Bobby Valentino to name a few. Another highlight was when he covered the MOBO awards in London interviewing the likes of Giggs, Stormzy, Stefflon Don, Skepta, Davido, Wizkid and others. “Those moments were surreal,” he said. “To be face-to-face with icons, capturing their energy and presence—it's something I'll never forget.” Today, Patrick stands as a seasoned industry professional whose journey is a testament to passion, resilience, and vision. His story serves as an inspiration not only to those in the media world but to anyone striving to rise from modest beginnings to international acclaim. As the industry continues to evolve, one thing remains certain: wherever there is a story to tell, Germaine will be there—behind the camera, crafting the narrative. Asked why he decided on a career in the media landscape, Germaine said “From a child I always liked to be creative and have a love for how movies and just videos were created.” He shared that the industry has changed significantly since he got his start, and he has adapted to the changes and the technology that have been introduced in the media. “The industry has evolved massively – technology has changed for the better, cameras have become smaller and more compact and just the overall process for creating videos has become quicker, and access for less expensive equipment is more accessible. The industry is an ever-evolving industry so you will always be learning no matter how many years you have been doing it,” Patrick reasoned."

n3r9h4c,2025-07-18 03:53:16,en,REDDIT,"  Since you're selling higher end items (that linen-cotton blend says haute couture, but for kids), I'm going to ask the obvious question: how targeted are your ads? You said you're getting a decent amount of traffic, but it's not converting. Are you getting add-to-carts and then the carts getting abandoned? Or not even add-to-cart? If no add-to-cart, then that tells me something is wrong either in the targeting (you're not attracting that high-income parent who wants something they can't find in the big box stores, and is the same level of quality they expect in their own adult clothing), or ... your website isn't telling the story adequately. Or maybe a mixture of both. The other poster already pointed out that you're not justifying the higher cost. Do some competitive research. Just search ""high end children's clothing"" and you'll get back a bunch of really high end children's clothing. I just saw a Burberry 3-item pack for babies that's a playsuit, a dungarees-with-skirt, and a hat for $610 CAD!!!! Look at how they present their items, what they're saying, what they focus on. The Burberry one said it's made with a custom print woven in Italy. That it's imported - from Italy. Italy ... land of fashion (next to France, okay). And that's how they justify that cost. Figure out what *you* can say to that mid-tier buyer (I guess $42 is only mid-range, now that I'm seeing some of the other prices!) that'll be compelling. Just saying it's a cotton-and-linen blend isn't enough. And yes, double check your demographic targeting. You need to be attracting that higher income audience. Someone living paycheck to paycheck may like what the ad says but then they get to the site and the price is too high? Then you shouldn't be targeting those people!"

Actor Manisha Koirala has received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Bradford in England. And she is elated about it, saying that the recognition means a lot to her. Manisha expresses gratitude On Thursday, Manisha took to Instagram to share a picture of herself after the felicitation event, and wrote a gratitude note. “It's a huge honour to receive an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Bradford — especially in the year it's been named the UK City of Culture 2025. Even more meaningful to share this recognition alongside the talented Daniel Lee, Creative Director of Burberry,” she wrote. The actor added, “Congratulations to the Class of 2025 — your journey is just beginning!” Earlier this week, she posted a video from the ceremony and said that she didn't get to the position in her life through the traditional path of education. “Today, I received an Honorary Doctorate from the University of Bradford. I stand here not as someone who came through the traditional path of education, but as someone who learned through life — through hard work, failure, resilience, and service,” she wrote. Manisha continued, “This honour means more than I can put into words. It's proof that no matter where you start, your journey matters. Thank you to the University of Bradford for seeing value in my story.” About Manisha's project Manisha's first acting project was the Nepali romantic-drama Pheri Bhetaula. She made her Bollywood debut with Subhash Ghai's Saudagar  1991 , and gained popularity through projects such as 1942: A Love Story  1994 , Bombay  1995 , Agni Sakshi  1996 , Gupt: The Hidden Truth  1997 , Dil Se. . 1998 , and Company  2002 . Manisha made a comeback after a long hiatus with Lust Stories  2018 , specifically in Dibakar Banerjee's segment of the anthology film. She recently starred in Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Heeramandi: The Diamond Bazaar  2024 , where she portrayed Mallikajaan, a courtesan. The Netflix series explores the intricate lives and power dynamics of courtesans with Nawabs and British officers in Lahore's Heera Mandi during the pre-partition era.

mov_15ABC57FD6B47014C19449CA24309BB8,2025-07-18 06:48:35,en,WEB,"  Burberry has said it is “encouraged” by the initial progress from its transformation plan but highlighted that trading conditions remain “challenging”. The London fashion house revealed that retail revenues fell by 6% to £433 million for the 13 weeks to June 28, compared with a year earlier, amid a drag from currency rates. However, it reflected a slowdown in the group's sales decline amid efforts to turn around its fortunes after coming under pressure from weaker luxury spending. Last November, the group launched a £40 million cost-cutting programme after first sinking to a loss. In May, the company announced proposals to cut about 1,700 jobs worldwide over the next two years as part of the shake-up. In its fresh update, Burberry said it has made some progress in its transformation efforts but is still in the “early stages” of the potential turnaround. The company said: “In the first half, we are continuing to prioritise investment and expect to see the impact of our initiatives build as the year progresses.” It pointed towards efforts to simplify its operations and improve productivity in a bid to improve profit margins. In the latest quarter, Burberry said there were improvements across its main regions, amid strong sales of “outerwear and scarves”. Comparable retail sales grew by 1% in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA) as positive local spending helped to offset declines among tourists. Meanwhile, its Americas business reported growth of 4% for the quarter. However, it said sales in Greater China fell 5% for the quarter, while its Asia Pacific division saw a drop of 4%, driven by a “challenging performance in Japan”. Joshua Schulman, chief executive of Burberry, said: “The improvement in our first quarter comparable sales, strength in our core categories, and uptick in brand desirability gives us conviction in the path ahead. “Our autumn 2025 collection is being well received by a broad range of luxury customers as it arrives in stores. “Although the external environment remains challenging and we are still in the early stages of our transformation, we are encouraged by the initial progress we are starting to see.”"

mov_BE1AB0CBF9ABD24626EB69ED9ACC9CA1,2025-07-18 08:47:32,en,WEB,"  Shares in Netflix () were in the red ahead of the US opening after the streaming giant reported a modest beat-and-raise earnings report overnight. For the second quarter, Netflix () saw a 16% increase in revenue, reaching $11.08bn (£8.24bn). Net profit surged by 46%, amounting to $3.1bn. These figures slightly exceeded the company's initial guidance for the period. The company also raised its full-year revenue forecast, now expecting between $44.8bn and $45.2bn, up from a prior range of $43.5bn to $44.5bn. The upward revision was driven by the weakening US dollar relative to other currencies, as well as ""healthy"" member growth and an increase in advertising revenue, Netflix () said in a statement. Netflix () revealed that this would be the second consecutive quarter it would not release specific subscription data updates. “Year-over-year revenue growth was primarily a function of more members, higher subscription pricing and increased ad revenue,” the company said in a statement. However, it warned that “operating margin in the second half of 2025 will be lower than the first half due to higher content amortisation and sales and marketing costs associated with our larger second half slate"". Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (), said: ""Despite the strong numbers, Netflix's () shares pulled back by approximately 1.7% in pre-market trading. Analysts suggested the drop may be attributed to high expectations already priced into the stock, combined with profit-taking and investor caution over the company's premium valuation. ""Better than expected quarterly results and upgraded full-year revenue and cash flow guidance weren't enough to keep investors happy. “Shares in Netflix () fell in pre-market trading following the results even though the company is going from strength to strength. Investors took fright at a few points in the update and locked in some profit after the shares doubled in value over the past 12 months. “Investors didn't like the fact that the core of its upgraded revenue guidance was foreign-exchange related rather than demand-driven. It is benefiting from the weakening US dollar relative to most other currencies. “Full-year margin guidance implies that the uplift in second quarter margins won't carry through to the second-half period. That's because it has some big releases on the schedule, including new series of Stranger Things and Wednesday, and it plans to market them heavily. ""Netflix () is betting that extra marketing spend could lead to a big uplift in customer numbers. This isn't a gamble; it's a calculated ploy that could yield big results. “Member growth already improved more than expected at the end of the second quarter, and advertising-related income looks interesting. “Netflix () plans to spend big bucks to strengthen its advertising sales infrastructure and capabilities. Many investors don't like it when money is going out the door rather than coming in. In reality, Netflix is spending money today to potentially make a lot more money tomorrow. Shares in Uber () were flat in pre-market trading despite its announcement of a partnership to deploy more than 20,000 robotaxis over the next six years as demand for driverless cars kicks into high gear. As part of the partnership, the ride-hailing company is collaborating with Lucid (), the electric vehicle maker, and Nuro (), an autonomous vehicle startup. Under the deal, Uber () will invest $300m in Lucid. Meanwhile, Nuro () will develop the self-driving technology that Lucid () will integrate into vehicles to supply Uber () with robotaxis throughout the duration of the partnership, with Nuro also set to receive a multi-hundred-million-dollar investment. Lucid's () stock surged 36% on Thursday following the announcement. The companies plan to launch the robotaxis in a major US urban hub next year. Over the course of six years starting in 2026, Uber () will acquire and deploy more than 20,000 Lucid () Gravity SUVs, each equipped with Nuro's () autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, according to a statement from the three companies. “We're thrilled to partner with Nuro () and Lucid () on this new robotaxi programme, purpose-built just for the Uber () platform, to safely bring the magic of autonomous driving to more people across the world,” said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a statement. Shares in BP () were higher in early morning trade as the oil major took another step in its strategic pivot back to oil and gas by agreeing to sell its US onshore wind business to LS Power. The wind business operates nine onshore wind energy assets across seven US states, all of which are grid-connected and provide power to customers. The wind farms are all operational and have a combined capacity of 1.7GW, of which BP () owns 1.3GW. After completion of the deal, which is expected before the end of the year, BP Wind Energy will form part of LS Power's subsidiary Clearlight Energy, increasing the North American energy group's operating fleet to about 4.3GW. The move comes as BP () seeks to streamline its business and refocus on its core oil and gas operation. William Lin, BP's () executive vice president for gas and low carbon energy, said: “We have been clear that while low carbon energy has a role to play in a simpler, more focused bp, we will continue to rationalise and optimise our portfolio to generate value. ""The onshore US wind business has great assets and fantastic people, but we have concluded we are no longer the best owners to take it forward."" Coinbase (), the largest US crypto exchange, saw its shares climb as the US House passed two major pieces of legislation designed to bring structure to digital asset markets, a move investors interpreted as a step toward long-awaited regulatory clarity. Coinbase's () shares gained 3.2% during the session, closing above $410 for the first time, pushing the company's market cap above $100bn. The stock further increased in pre-market trading, reaching $418. This surge came after the House passed the Clarity Act, which addresses crypto market structure oversight, and the Genius Act, which lays out a framework for regulating stablecoins. The stablecoin bill, which already cleared the Senate last month, is now poised for potential signing into law. Coinbase (), which offers futures trading in the US and spot and perpetual futures products outside the US, stands to benefit significantly from the passage of these bills. “It's really urgent for us to get it settled so that investors can invest in the sector, and that tokens that are issued can be traded on our platform,” Faryar Shirzad, Coinbase's () chief policy officer, said on Wednesday. The stablecoin market, currently valued around $240bn, is projected to see substantial growth, with some high-end estimates forecasting a market size of $1tn or more in the coming years. Coinbase () also holds a stake in Circle (), the largest US stablecoin issuer. Bitcoin () was up by 1% to $119,852 at the time of writing. Shares in Burberry () were higher in London as the luxury fashion brand reported a smaller-than-expected drop in sales, signaling early signs of progress under new CEO Joshua Schulman's turnaround plan...."

mov_9FB7AEFA5AB12F09CBDEDC8FACDC88C2,2025-07-18 09:13:17,en,WEB,"  How does the Oasis brand rush underline the growing demand for mass market cultural moments to meaningfully connect with consumers? Oasis fever has well and truly hit the UK. If you get the privilege of being in Manchester during the Oasis Heaton Park run, you will be greeted by a sea of bucket hats and endless merch. The whole city is alive with music. Everywhere you look there are brand tie-ups, themed products (Champagne Supernova or Oasis cocktail anyone?) and murals of the Gallagher brothers. Primark on Market Street has installed a 'Vote Noel' and 'Vote Liam' door where people can vote for their favourite band member with their feet as they enter the store. Elsewhere,  Bury New Road Aldi has rebranded to 'Aldeh', and even the smallest of shops are cashing in on the hype with signs with messages such as: 'Sale! Don't Look Back in Anger!' It's not just in the band's hometown of Manchester getting in on the hype, official Oasis stores have opened in Cardiff, London, Edinburgh, Birmingham and Dublin. With brands like Adidas, Levi, Burberry and Berghaus all launching Oasis-themed campaigns, the reunion has provided a cultural moment that has connected audiences across the UK at a time when people are craving escapism, fun and some much-needed nostalgia. Connecting with audiences is no easy feat amid the endless bad news cycle. Yet the power of two brothers reuniting to capture the imagination of audiences underlines how people are seeking genuine cultural moments to share in and spark joy. With the tour in full swing and dates still to go across the UK and US, we asked industry experts if the Oasis brand rush reflect a growing demand for cultural moments to connect with consumers? Unquestionably. In an age where monoculture is dead, splintered by algorithms and siloed feeds, cultural moments like Oasis' Manchester return are rare, precious flashpoints of shared meaning. They offer intersectionality: emotional common ground where brand creativity can not only show up, but resonate. This past weekend proved it. Aldi's Manc-accented checkouts, Liam-voiced tram stops, Berghaus' Trango revival, these weren't surface-level stunts. They were crafted acts of brand participation in something bigger. Local in flavour, national in scale, and deeply rooted in cultural truth. It's not just big brands which can capitalise either, mydentist temporarily rebranded its Stevenson Square practice to {r}dentist. With craft, humour and local flair, smaller brands can punch far above their weight. Because when culture moves en masse, creativity has the chance to interrupt the scroll and forge connection across age, background, even postcode. It's not about riding trends. It's about belonging to moments that matter, and having the bravery to say something meaningful within them. Cultural alignment like this gives brands the rarest gift in modern marketing: relevance that doesn't feel forced. In a world where consumers expect brands to earn their place, these moments are golden openings to be heard, understood, and maybe even loved. Here's the thing: the Oasis frenzy isn't just a nod to nostalgia, it's a strategic flex in cultural programming. In a landscape where consumers crave relevance over reach, brands are shifting away from traditional influencer playbooks and towards moments, objects, and contexts that feel culturally alive. What we're seeing is the rise of brands treating culture not as an accessory, but as an operating system. Oasis didn't just trend because of the name. They tapped into a shared memory, a tribal signal, and crucially, the right mood. Contrary to mainstream belief, Oasis didn't create that mood; it was shaped by subcultural chatter, timing, and the social dynamics of what's cool now. They just so happen to be perpetually cool IMHO, call it the commercialisation of cool powered by a blend of nostalgia, fandom and cultural resonance. A triple threat. Cultural programming is about more than visibility. It's about designing for discovery, embedding your brand into the right contexts, where insiders share before celebrities amplify. It's merch, moments, and micro-trends that ladder up to meaning. The real takeaway: The opportunity for brands is to move from borrowing fame to building cultural capital, tapping into the social codes, objects, and behaviours that signify belonging. It's no longer enough to just 'roll with it'  when it comes to culture; you need to shape it. The Oasis reunion is another marker in a growing trend of nostalgia driving huge emotional responses from consumers. We don't need to look far for examples of brands getting in on the act – Nike, adidas and Oakley re-releasing 00's silhouettes, nostalgia acts drawing huge crowds at Glastonbury, and even Coca-Cola' revival of 2011's 'Share a Coke' campaign. The Oasis reunion, therefore, is a rich space for brands looking to capitalise on a huge moment in British music. But while the instinct is right, the impact depends entirely on execution. When done well, these activations can create genuine excitement that goes beyond engagement and generates real world impact. Our cross-agency work with Lidl proves this: the Cannes-winning 'Lidl Jacket' billboard from OMD and Droga opportunistically capitalised on an audience observation that Coolr picked up on social, striking a smart balance between relevance and irreverence. It was followed up by the Romans' 'Lidl by Lidl', mimicking Liam's Stone Island collab in a way that connected with our audience, leading to instant sell out of our limited edition jackets. For us, it's all about understanding your brand's role in culture. Lidl has a long reputation as a challenger, and our fans expect us to 'punch up' and take risks...."

Según la lectura final del dato, dada a conocer por la agencia europea de estadística Eurostat, el índice de precios de consumo (IPC) de la Eurozona repuntó el 0,3% en el mes de junio con relación a mayo, lectura que estuvo en línea con su preliminar y con lo esperado por los analistas del consenso de FactSet. En tasa interanual el IPC de la Eurozona repuntó el 2,0% en junio (1,9% en mayo), lectura igualmente en línea con su preliminar y con lo proyectado por los analistas. En el mes de junio de 2024 esta tasa era del 2,5%. En junio de 2025, la mayor contribución a la tasa interanual de la Eurozona provino de los precios de los servicios (+1,51 puntos porcentuales, p.p.), 3 seguidos de los de los precios de los alimentos, alcohol y tabaco (+0,59 p.p.), de los precios de los bienes industriales no energéticos (+0,13 p.p.) y de los precios de la energía (-0,25 p.p.). Por países, y dentro de la Eurozona, la inflación más baja se registró en junio en Chipre (0,5%), Francia (0,9%) e Irlanda (1,6%), mientras la más elevada se dio en Estonia (5,2%) y Eslovaquia (4,6%). En comparación con mayo de 2025, la inflación anual disminuyó en cinco Estados miembros y aumentó en veintidós. Por su parte, el IPC subyacente de la Eurozona, que excluye los precios de los alimentos, el alcohol y el tabaco y los precios de la energía, subió el 0,4% en junio con relación a mayo y el 2,3% en tasa interanual (2,3% en mayo). En ambos casos las lecturas estuvieron también en línea con sus preliminares. Valoración: se confirman las lecturas preliminares de la inflación de la Eurozona en el mes de junio, lecturas que apuntalan la idea de que la inflación en la región está actualmente bajo control. En ello tiene mucho que ver la debilidad generalizada de la demanda en la región y la fortaleza del dólar, que abarata las importaciones, especialmente las energéticas. De momento, creemos que el BCE dará por finalizado su proceso de bajadas de tipos, a la espera de comprobar el impacto que tanto en el crecimiento económico como en la inflación tiene la “guerra comercial” iniciada a nivel global por la Administración Trump. REINO UNIDO . Según dio a conocer la Oficina Nacional de Estadística británica, la ONS, la tasa de desempleo del Reino Unido subió hasta el 4,7% en el trimestre finalizado en mayo desde el 4,6% del trimestre anterior, superando de esta forma lo esperado por el consenso de analistas de FactSet, que era una lectura del 4,6%. La del trimestre terminado en mayo es la tasa de desempleo más elevada que se alcanza en el país desde la del trimestre finalizado en julio de 2021. En comparación con el período anterior, el desempleo aumentó para aquellos desempleados de hasta 6 meses, entre 6 y 12 meses, y más de 12 meses. En términos anuales, el desempleo también aumentó en cada una de estas categorías. Por su parte, el número de personas empleadas creció en el trimestre finalizado en mayo en 134.000 personas, hasta los 34,13 millones de empleados, el nivel más alto desde febrero, impulsado por las ganancias tanto en el empleo a tiempo parcial como en el empleo a tiempo completo. El consenso de analistas esperaba una cifra muy inferior, de 40.000 nuevos empleados. El número de personas con un segundo empleo también aumentó, representando ahora el 3,9% de todas las personas empleadas. Por último, la tasa de inactividad económica disminuyó 0,3 puntos porcentuales hasta el 21%. Por otra parte, cabe destacar que el salario regular, sin incluir bonificaciones, en el Reino Unido aumentó un 5,0% en tasa interanual en el trimestre finalizado en mayo, lo que supone su menor incremento en casi tres años, tras un aumento revisado al alza del 5,3% en el período anterior y ligeramente por encima de las previsiones del 4,9%. El crecimiento salarial se desaceleró tanto en el sector privado (4,9% vs 5,2% trimestre precedente) como en el público (5,5% vs 5,6% trimestre precedente). Entre los sectores, el mayor crecimiento salarial anual se observó en el comercio mayorista, minorista, hoteles y restaurantes (7,1%), seguido de los servicios (6%), la construcción (4,9%), la industria manufacturera (4,8%) y los servicios financieros y empresariales (3,1%). Ajustados a la inflación, los salarios reales crecieron un 1,1%. Si se incluyen bonificaciones, las ganancias semanales promedio totales en el Reino Unido aumentaron un 5,0% en tasa interanual en el trimestre finalizado en mayo, la tasa más baja en ocho meses, en comparación con un 5,4% revisado al alza en el período anterior y las previsiones de los analistas de un 5,0%.

mov_3646B801BB45F9A22A7596CD115B8860,2025-07-18 09:43:29,en,WEB,"  Shoppers snapping up Burberry wellies, scarves and light jackets to wear at music festivals have helped the fashion brand to its best sales performance in 18 months despite lacklustre spending by tourists around the world. Sales of the luxury British brand fell 2% to £433m in the three months to the end of June, with a 1% decline at established stores, an improvement from the 6% fall in the previous quarter and the best performance since Christmas 2023. Shares in Burberry rose more than 4% on Friday morning on the better-than-expected performance, as Joshua Schulman, who was appointed a year ago, attempts a turnaround. Sales rose in Europe and the Americas but continued to fall in Asia, including its all-important Chinese market, which accounts for 30% of sales. Schulman, the former boss of the US fashion brand Coach, said: “Its a tough macro [environment] out there and we are taking things step by step but we are optimistic about the quarters ahead and the business in general.” He said the company had appealed to “elite VIP” customers with events linked to its partnership with King Charles's Highgrove estate and also to a younger luxury customer through festival-linked pop-ups featuring DJ sets located in shopping centres. A trial of dedicated “scarf bars” within stores have also gone well and the company plans to install 200 in total. “We are appealing to a much broader range of luxury consumers,” he said. Adam Cochrane, an analyst at Deutsche, said further growth was largely dependent on Burberry's ability to “replicate the success” of its core products in other areas. The company said it was “still in the early stages of our turnaround” with aims to continue simplifying the business and improving productivity and cashflow. It expects to achieve £80m of its planned £100m cost cuts this financial year, with the remainder next year, and has already reorganised the business under four regional heads. The company said in May it was cutting up to 1,700 jobs, including an entire shift at its Yorkshire raincoat factory, in an effort to make £60m in cost savings on top of a £40m savings programme announced in November. Schulman said Burberry's autumn ranges were being “well received”, although the external environment “remains challenging. Over the past year, we have moved from stabilising the business to driving Burberry forward with confidence. “The improvement in our first quarter comparable sales, strength in our core categories, and uptick in brand desirability gives us conviction in the path ahead,” he said. He called on the UK government to implement policies that would “encourage tourism” as he said: “International consumers are not shopping in the UK to the extent we would like due to the lack of a VAT refund scheme.” The scheme was phased out under the last government. “All luxury brands and all retail brands would benefit from that,” he said."

The internationally-oriented FTSE 100 was up 0.1% as of 1044 GMT, and was on track for a fourth consecutive week of gains, while the midcap FTSE 250 index rose 0.5%. The blue-chip index surged to all-time highs earlier this week as investors shrugged off domestic growth concerns to take comfort in a relatively U.S. tariff-shielded market, higher commodity prices and hopes of a Bank of England rate cut. ""The FTSE 100 continues to prove that the stock market is not the economy, with rising unemployment, a black hole in the public finances, and resurgent inflation pressures doing little to dampen sentiment for the UK's top stock index,"" said Joshua Mahony, chief market analyst at Scope Markets. The FTSE 100 has gained about 10% so far this year, beating the pan-European STOXX 600 index which is up 8.1%. Among stocks, Burberry shares jumped 6.5% on Friday to their highest in nearly 17 months after the luxury brand's comparable retail sales fell less than expected. The strong earnings showed early signs of a recovery for the company that has struggled with underperformance. Heavyweight BP also gained 2% after the energy major said it had agreed to sell its U.S. onshore wind business, bp Wind Energy, to U.S.-based electricity transmission systems operator LS Power. On the flip side, GSK was the biggest drag on the blue-chip index, dropping 6.1% to a three-month low, after a U.S. FDA advisory panel recommended against approving the pharmaceutical giant's blood cancer drug Blenrep, citing earlier concerns over eye-related side effects.

The London fashion house revealed that retail revenues fell by 6% to £433 million for the 13 weeks to June 28, compared with a year earlier, amid a drag from currency rates. However, it reflected a slowdown in the group's sales decline amid efforts to turn around its fortunes after coming under pressure from weaker luxury spending. Last November, the group launched a £40 million cost-cutting programme after first sinking to a loss. In May, the company announced proposals to cut about 1,700 jobs worldwide over the next two years as part of the shake-up. In its fresh update, Burberry said it has made some progress in its transformation efforts but is still in the “early stages” of the potential turnaround. The company said: “In the first half, we are continuing to prioritise investment and expect to see the impact of our initiatives build as the year progresses.” It pointed towards efforts to simplify its operations and improve productivity in a bid to improve profit margins. In the latest quarter, Burberry said there were improvements across its main regions, amid strong sales of “outerwear and scarves”. Comparable retail sales grew by 1% in Europe, the Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA) as positive local spending helped to offset declines among tourists. Meanwhile, its Americas business reported growth of 4% for the quarter. However, it said sales in Greater China fell 5% for the quarter, while its Asia Pacific division saw a drop of 4%, driven by a “challenging performance in Japan”. Joshua Schulman, chief executive of Burberry, said: “The improvement in our first quarter comparable sales, strength in our core categories, and uptick in brand desirability gives us conviction in the path ahead. “Our autumn 2025 collection is being well received by a broad range of luxury customers as it arrives in stores. “Although the external environment remains challenging and we are still in the early stages of our transformation, we are encouraged by the initial progress we are starting to see.” The boss also highlighted that the business was continuing to see weak trading from tourists in London. The firm reiterated recent calls for the Government to consider reintroducing the scheme which allowed foreign visitors to claim back VAT, which was scrapped in 2021. “In the UK we still continue to have international consumers not shopping in the UK to the extent we would do. And that does link to the lack of a VAT refund scheme. “We would like to see changes from the Government which would encourage tourism and shopping, and that is a lever they could pull.” Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said: “Having stabilised the business, there is evidence Schulman is beginning to gain some traction with his turnaround effort. “Although sales are still declining, the rate of decline has slowed considerably and by more than the market expected. “The problem is that Burberry is operating against less than favourable market conditions, so it could end up running hard just to stand still. “It was notable to see the business acknowledge the challenging backdrop and its key Chinese market, in particular, remains under pressure.” Shares in Burberry climbed by 6.4% in early trading."

The Fashion Inspiration for 'The Gilded Age' Wedding Scene Was the Princess Diana of Her Time  Gladys Russell's show-stopping wedding gown was designed by a worldwide team of artisans—and nodded to a real-life heiress. On the fashion front, Gladys's long-sleeved, rosette-covered wedding gown is straight out of a fairytale, making her less-than-happy ending all the more tragic. So, too, was the opulent guest attire, bridesmaid gowns, and historically accurate suiting worn by the rest of the cast. Naturally, Costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone, who's worked across the show's three seasons, went fully custom for the big wedding scene. Using “a combination of historical research, paintings, and fashion references” as inspiration, she tapped a global village of makers and artisans to bring the vision to life. “Producing the bridesmaid dresses, wedding guests, and clergy took an extraordinary amount of assistant costume designers, shoppers, costumers, makers, milliners, and fitters,” she explains.

But layering is trickier to master than you might initially imagine… Link length is the most important factor, as necklaces are best showcased when gradated, but textures are also key – each chain needs to be both different and complementary at the same time. And don't even get us started on the art of seamlessly weaving in this season's favourite beads and pearls, too         30 Expert-Approved Wavy Haircuts That Will Enhance Your Natural Texture   Most wavy hair types can be easily straightened, blown-out, curled, or left natural—and their in-between texture also makes them the perfect foundation for virtually any haircut, including pixie cuts, blunt lobs, short bobs, and even mullets...."

FULL TEXT Back in late 2018, a lifetime ago in fashion, a radical shift happened in footwear. Square-toed clunkers - sandals defined by exaggerated, spatula-like soles that jutted out from under the foot and pumps with bulbous stubbed toes - were shown in Daniel Lee's first collection for Bottega Veneta. At first sight, the shoes were hideous. Within months, they were on the feet of nearly every celebrity, editor, influencer and luxury V.I.C. in the land. Retailers like Vince Camuto and Shein promptly issued dupes of the popular Lido sandal, a simple slide in a blown-up interpretation of Bottega's signature intrecciato woven leather. Lyst declared them the ""hottest shoes in the world"" in 2019. ""It's funny what you can make people wear in fashion if it's done the right way,"" said Nina Christen, the Swiss shoe designer responsible for the Lido. Ms. Christen's distinctive touch has quite literally been all over some of the most influential shoe design trickling down from luxury houses for the better part of the last decade. She has worked for Phoebe Philo at Celine, Jonathan Anderson at Loewe, Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen at the Row and Mr. Lee at Bottega Veneta. Last month, Mr. Anderson hired Ms. Christen as the design director of shoes at Christian Dior. It's one of the biggest jobs in fashion right now, and she is balancing it with a moonlighting gig, too. Last year, Ms. Christen introduced Christen, her own independent shoe brand. The first pure expression of her design identity came partly out of frustration. The shoes she designed for other brands were her taste, her take, she said, ""but they were never 100 percent myself."" Opportunity arose when she met Paul Dupuy, an entrepreneur and a founder of Zoi, a health-tech company in the longevity space. Ms. Christen designed uniforms for Zoi's staff and clients, and Mr. Dupuy was so impressed that he offered to help her start her own brand. His mother was a fashion designer, and he has friends in the industry. He got it. ""When she told me she designed shoes for Loewe and Bottega, I was like: 'OK. This is solid,'"" Mr. Dupuy said. Ms. Christen already had a complete vision for a brand beyond shoes: the perfect pair of Japanese denim jeans, the perfect leather jacket, even fine jewelry, the first piece of which is a diamond toe ring. All are prototyped and planned. She had the packaging, branding, logo and positioning in mind. Mr. Dupuy raised $5 million in capital and helps with business logistics, including with the planning of a store in Paris slated for 2026. Christen shoes are produced in Italy by the same factories and specialists that work with big luxury brands. The prices - $1,100 to $3,650 - reflect Ms. Christen's uncompromising production standards and ambition to compete at the highest level. On a morning in late June, the raw cement floor of the studio below Ms. Christen's apartment in Paris was set with more than 30 examples of her designs arranged in a neatly art-directed grid. Three styles from Loewe's spring 2023 runway collection stood out for their cartoonish, fantastical qualities: There were pumps embroidered with an explosion of deflated white balloons and sandals abloom with a giant, hyper-realistic anthurium. Red rubber pumps that looked fit for Minnie Mouse were particularly complicated. ""You can't wear this for more than two hours,"" Ms. Christen said of the pumps. ""But Jonathan Anderson was very open to ideas that really crossed the line between art and fashion."" By comparison, the Christen styles on display appeared compact, sexy and razor-sharp. ""I love the space of geometric shapes,"" Ms. Christen said, surveying the body of work at her feet. ""When I think of toe shapes, for example, it's all about that. Is it a square? Is it rectangle? Is it a circle? Is it oval? What is the degree?"" She wore a pair of Christen white sandals that left the foot nearly naked, bisecting it with a single strip of leather like a strand of floss through the big and second toes. The sole was thin and slightly elongated under the toes, like an insole that was a size too big. The proportions of the shoes varied wildly, but a common thread was a certain offness. Ms. Christen thinks a lot about redefining standards. ""It's about creating things we are not used to yet,"" she said. ""When I make something and I don't know if I like it, that's always a good sign."" Ms. Christen, 40, grew up in Bern, Switzerland, ""obsessed with fashion without an explanation,"" she said...."

The fluffy creatures, launched in 1985, have become a childhood classic. But the Sylvanian Drama TikTok account sees them acting out adult sketches involving drink, drugs, cheating, violence and even murder. The Japanese maker of the toys, Epoch Company Ltd, filed a copyright infringement case in the US saying the videos are causing ""irreparable injury"" to its reputation. The owner of the TikTok account, Thea Von Engelbrechten, from Ireland, filed a counternotice claiming her works were ""parody"". The skits are such a hit that the account has 2.5 million followers and the videos have racked up 68 million likes. Sylvanian Drama also has accounts on Instagram, YouTube, X and Facebook. It has partnered with major brands including Marc Jacobs, Burberry, Netflix and Hilton for advertising posts. Sylvanian Families are marketed as ""an adorable range of distinctive animal characters with charming and beautiful homes, furniture and accessories"". They live in stylish houses surrounded by luscious greenery, woodland, a meadow and a river. Characters have names like Freya the Chocolate Rabbit girl, Ambrose the Walnut Squirrel baby and Pino the Latte Cat baby. They usually have wholesome adventures with stories entitled Picnic by the sea, Surprise shopping trip and Ice cream for everyone. 'Insecure people, diet culture, toxic men' But the SylvanianDrama TikTok account sees the creatures in costumes and fake eyelashes, with captions saying things like ""My marriage is falling apart"" and ""My boyfriend won't post me on Instagram"". Court documents filed by Epoch with the Southern District of New York on 4 July and seen by the BBC accuse Ms Von Engelbrechten of infringing the company's copyright without its permission, causing irreparable injury to its goodwill and reputation. The court document states that in , Ms Von Engelbrechten said her inspiration for the storylines came from ""cringey TV shows and early 2000s comedy"". She went on: ""I'm also really inspired by my cats because they are extremely sassy and self-obsessed and can be so cute, but they also have no morals when it comes to killing other animals. I try to embody that with the Sylvanians."" Asked why she thought her videos were so popular she told Fohr: ""Maybe it's because it's coming from the voice of a 22-year-old who struggles with the same things as [they do]. I have a lot of storylines about insecure people, diet culture, toxic men, and sustainability, which I think other girls my age are also thinking a lot about."" A date has been set for 14 August for a pre-trial conference. This is when legal teams from both sides meet to explore settlement options or prepare the case for trial. Epoch Company Ltd and Ms Von Engelbrechten did not respond to the BBC's requests for comment."

百事和可口可乐都表示可以使用蔗糖。 欧盟表示愿意与美国互相削减汽车关税。 特斯拉Cybertruck美国销量连续三个季度下滑。 奈飞开始在影视剧制作中使用生成式人工智能。 雪佛龙完成了对赫斯的收购。 沃尔沃汽车、斯沃琪集团、博柏利、美国运通、嘉信理财公布业绩。 百事公司(PepsiCo)周四表示，如果消费者有需求，其饮料产品也将使用蔗糖。 此前，特朗普称可口可乐(Coca-Cola)将开始在美国市场的饮料中使用蔗糖。 可口可乐方面则对特朗普的热情表示感谢，并承诺将很快分享更多创新产品的细节。 目前，百事和可口可乐的汽水均使用高果糖玉米糖浆，这种原料通常更具成本效益。 除了愿意改可乐配方，百事高管表示，当今年晚些时候百事公司计划重新推出旗下乐事和多力多滋品牌时，将着重宣传其薯片或玉米片中不含人工色素和香精。 欧盟已恢复向美国提供对等的汽车关税减免，谈判代表们放弃了最初由德国汽车制造商提出的复杂“出口抵消进口机制”(netting mechanism)方案。 根据欧盟谈判代表的最新提议，如果特朗普政府将对欧盟汽车行业的关税降至20%以下，欧盟将放弃对美国汽车出口征收10%关税。 此举是布鲁塞尔在美国总统特朗普发动关税攻击后，为解决欧盟与美国达成框架协议以稳定跨大西洋贸易关系的最大绊脚石而做出的最新尝试。 电动汽车巨头特斯拉(Tesla)正面临巨大的需求问题，尤其是其号称将改变行业的电动皮卡Cybertruck。 据Cox Automotive的数据，特斯拉的Cybertruck在今年第二季度的美国销量为4306辆，连续第三个季度下滑，创下了一年来的最差纪录。 Cybertruck在第二季度的销量环比下降了32%，同比则下降51%。 Cybertruck于2019年作为原型车发布，并于2023年底投入生产。 特斯拉首席执行官马斯克曾雄心勃勃地表示该车每年交付多达25万辆，但这一目标从未实现。 优步(Uber)计划斥资3亿美元入股美国电动汽车制造商Lucid，作为这笔交易的一部分，该网约车平台将推出其首个自动驾驶出租车车队。 两家公司周四表示，优步将从Lucid购买至少2万辆汽车，并成为Lucid仅次于沙特公共投资基金(PIF)的的第二大股东。 根据协议，Lucid的Gravity SUV的定制版车型(集成自动驾驶初创公司Nuro的技术)将在六年时间里逐步部署到优步的系统中，从明年开始，先在美国某个大城市上线。 奈飞(Netflix)表示已开始在其制作的电影和剧集中使用人工智能。 该平台在阿根廷剧集《El Atonata》中呈现了 “屏幕上首个生成式人工智能制作的最终片段”。 奈飞内部制作团队与制片人合作，利用人工智能制作了一个建筑物倒塌的场景。 借助人工智能，该场景的完成速度比使用传统视觉效果工具快10倍，且成本更低。 奈飞还在其他领域使用生成式人工智能，包括个性化推荐、搜索和广告，公司计划在今年下半年推出交互式广告。 亚马逊(Amazon.com)正在裁减云计算部门AWS的员工，这是在人工智能(AI)成本飙升背景下最新一家裁员的大型科技公司。 此次裁员影响到了AWS旗下的多个团队数百人。 亚马逊首席执行官Andy Jassy在6月份曾表示，预计在未来几年内，亚马逊的员工数量将会减少，因为该公司正利用人工智能来处理更多的工作。 OpenAI在自主运行AI机器人这一大热领域推出了其最新产品，这是一款能让用户自动执行在线购物等任务并创建电子表格和PowerPoint演示文稿的智能体。 这款名为ChatGPT agent的智能体运行在一个为驱动该功能而创建的新AI模型上。 它的工作方式与OpenAI的“Operator”智能体一样，通过自带的浏览器访问互联网，并且能像人一样点击、滚动和输入。 OpenAI新的演示文稿和电子表格功能使其与商业软件巨头微软形成更直接的竞争。 人工智能搜索引擎Perplexity在两个月前以140亿美元估值融资后，如今估值已跃升至180亿美元，投资者纷纷争抢进入最热门的AI初创公司。 在过去18个月里，Perplexity已经进行了五轮融资，其估值从2024年初的大约5亿美元一路飙升至今年5月的140亿美元。 全球最大的芯片代工生产商台积电将加快该公司在美国亚利桑那州的扩张步伐，以满足美国市场上人工智能(AI)和高性能计算领域客户飙升的需求。 台积电首席执行官魏哲家周四表示，该公司将把部分计划中设施的投产时间提前“几个季度”。 他还称，此次扩张是为了在亚利桑那州创建一个“超大晶圆厂集群”，以支持AI和智能手机等业务领域的美国客户。 雪佛龙(Chevron)在巴黎获得一项关键裁决，这使其530亿美元收购赫斯(Hess)的交易获批，并得以进入十年内最大的油田之一。 雪佛龙周五表示，在巴黎国际商会做出裁决后不久，便完成了对赫斯的收购。 埃克森美孚(ExxonMobil)此前曾对雪佛龙收购赫斯的要约提出异议，赫斯是能够进入圭亚那近海大型斯塔布鲁克区块油田的三家公司之一。 雪佛龙于2023年10月宣布收购赫斯的交易。 英国石油公司(BP)周五表示，已同意将其美国陆上风电业务bp Wind Energy出售给美国输电系统运营商LS Power。 在其股价表现落后于竞争对手后，投资者要求英国石油提高盈利能力的压力越来越大，该公司一直在剥离资产和合作伙伴关系。 这笔交易是在英国石油CEO默里·奥金克洛斯计划削减可再生能源方面的投资，并增加石油和天然气方面的支出，以提高回报之际达成的。 被出售后的bp Wind Energy将由LS Power的投资组合公司Clearlight Energy拥有和运营。 英国消费品巨头利洁时公司(Reckitt Benckiser)周五表示，已同意将旗下生产Air Wick清新剂的Essential Home业务出售给私募股权公司安宏资本(Advent International)，交易价值48亿美元，包括债务在内。 利洁时将保留该部门30%的股份。 Essential Home业务几个季度以来一直举步维艰，今年第一季度的销售额下降了7%，占利洁时集团收入的13%左右。..."

mov_522C069372660BD3A2A8A3882BAC10AD,2025-07-20 05:01:20,en,WEB,"  The value of the European luxury goods market grew to almost €110 billion in 2024. ""This is the result of several converging factors,"" assesses Rafal Drzewiecki, TikTok's Country Director for Central Europe, in an interview with Euronews. ""The recovery of tourism after the pandemic, attractive exchange rates and the growing importance of emotional consumption. European luxury has become more accessible."" In his opinion, a generational change is playing a key role. New consumers of luxury no longer buy for prestige. They buy for themselves. This is borne out of the popularity of the hashtag #selfgifting, which has seen a 110% increase on TikTok in recent times alone. ""We are seeing an explosion of content in which users celebrate their own achievements by buying themselves a gift,"" said Drzewiecki, adding that ""it's not about demonstrating status, but about pleasure, satisfaction, and self-expression"". Rafał Drzewiecki, Country Director for Central Europe at TikTok in an interview with Euronews - Paweł Głogowski/Euronews Polish luxury conquers the world Against this background, Poland comes off impressively. The domestic luxury goods market grew by as much as 24% year-on-year in 2023 - well above the European average. The fastest growing segments are beauty, fashion and accessories. It is not only global brands that have benefited from the wave of interest in luxury, but also Polish brands with character. TikTok has played no small part in this. An example? Inglot, a well-known cosmetics brand from Przemyśl, which gained a new global audience thanks to its presence on the platform. Local brands have the opportunity to reach an international audience and go beyond the local context thanks to TikTok - Inglot/TikTok ""Brands such as Inglot and Chylak show that a well-told story and authenticity reach an international audience. On TikTok today, they are building communities around values, aesthetics and everyday rituals,"" Drzewiecki told Euronews. In user content - from tutorials to 'get ready with me' - Inglot's products appear on smartphone screens from São Paulo to Seoul. The 9:16 aesthetic has become a natural environment for luxury. Related Luxury without the glitz The new generation expects more than perfect shots. What matters is authenticity. Premium brand campaigns gain popularity when they are real, surprisingly everyday - such as Burberry's clip of The Crown actors making tea. Olivia Colman, odtwórczyni roli królowej Elżbiety II w serialu „The Crown” w kampanii Burberry - (fot. Burberry/TikTok) ""It works because it's human. The consumer today doesn't want advertising - they want relationships,"" Drzewiecki added. This can also be seen in the data. As many as 89% of users say they trust the opinion of influencers more than classic advertising. One in four refrains from making a purchase until they have seen the product from their favourite creator. In contrast, 60% of Polish TikTok users admit that they have been influenced into purchases through content on the platform. TikTok rewards authenticity, meaning content that is honest, human, and sometimes even imperfect is often more successful. - Burberry/TikTok Related TikTok made me buy it The #TikTokMadeMeBuyIt trend has already amassed over 18.5 million videos. This is not a joke, but a conversion path. Today, luxury is not the result of a marketing strategy - it is an emotion, a moment, an aesthetic. ""If a product looks good, tells a story and resonates with the viewer's identity, a purchase decision is made almost immediately,"" Drzewiecki explained. Millennials and Gen Z are more likely to buy products that are reviewed by creators on the platform. - Ellie Delphine/TikTok The luxury of tomorrow is a brand that listens Does luxury have a future? Only if it becomes more accessible, more empathetic and ready to talk. ""The new generation expects authenticity, not perfection, from brands,"" said the director, adding that young people want ""relationships, social engagement, and shared values""...."

1m4j6tb,2025-07-20 07:46:34,en,REDDIT,"  I purchased Harper fall of last year from Amazon before they changed the product image — so it still showed the Burberry style fit. I was a little more than peeved that it came with the current white/iridescent fit and sunglass blanket. I obviously returned it out of frustration and didn't take another look until earlier this past week when it was on sale. ***WELL***, I caved and reordered it because I still like the doll itself after all — just for it to show up to my door with screwy joints, different wrist pegs that were two diff lengths (with the shorter one falling out if you bump it even ***slightly*** too hard). That wasn't all — she had glue (or resin maybe?) on her left eyebrow and forearms which was very strange. The hair felt like it had two expired bottles of gorilla snot gel in it + was shedding a ridiculous amount especially for it being in its gelled state. The sunglasses were unforgivable tbh because the paint was peeling and chipping off of them. Anyways, I “complained” and returned it for an exchange with hopes that it'll be better once I received the new one. I WAS WRONG!!! I got my replacement yesterday and was just too tired to unbox anything — so I waited to unpack and look at it until today. I pulled it out of the box to see a brand new “replacement” that has scratches/bangs on the inner knee area of BOTH legs, weird staining on the right leg, biceps that look like that look like the belong to Roxie and forearms that belong to Michelle😭. Like they didn't even try it seems. The nail polish is barely there as well. Oh! And did I mention the splotchy smudged blush on the left side of the face? I'm just trying to figure out what the deal is because this is unacceptable. I'm really sad because Harper is so pretty, but I just cannot keep her like this. Not even going to remove her from the box. Sorry if this is the incorrect flair (wasn't sure if this falls under question/help)"
