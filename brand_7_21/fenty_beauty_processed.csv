Après s'être illustrée dans le septième art avec A Star is Born, dont elle est l'actrice principale, la chanteuse a annoncé la création de Haus Laboratories ce mardi 9 juillet. Quelques jours après le leak de visuels qui s'apparentent à des photos de campagne non-retouchées, elle vient de dévoiler sur ses réseaux une vidéo promotionnelle réalisée par Daniel Sannwald. « La dernière chose dont le monde a besoin, c'est d'une nouvelle marque de cosmétiques… Dommage ! » y clame l'artiste en voix off alors qu'elle est filmée de face, avant de laisser place à une flopée de mannequins aux sexes et origines variées, ou appartenant à la communauté LGBTQ+. Lady Gaga vise ainsi à célébrer l'individualité et la singularité tout en prônant l'acceptation de soi, le body-positivisme et la tolérance : un message qui n'est pas sans évoquer les paroles du titre « Born this Way ». [/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_video link= »https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=SCM2lWePOnw »][vc_empty_space][vc_column_text] « Quand j'étais jeune, je ne me suis jamais sentie belle. Mais j'ai découvert le pouvoir du maquillage. […] J'ai découvert ma beauté en ayant la capacité de m'inventer et de me transformer », explique sur Instagram celle qui s'est créé un véritable personnage grâce à ses tenues et make-up baroques, depuis ses débuts dans les années 2000.  Officiellement disponibles en simultané dans 9 pays dont la France dès le mois de septembre, les produits proposés par Haus Laboratories n'ont pas encore été présentés mais pourront être précommandés dès le 15 juillet à en croire le compte à rebours qui défile sur le site de la marque. Comme le révèle la chanteuse dans un entretien exclusif accordé à Business of Fashion, ces derniers seront par ailleurs uniquement vendus sur l'immense plateforme de e-commerce Amazon, prisée par les consommateurs pour sa rapidité et louée par Lady Gaga pour la grande liberté qu'elle lui a accordé. Une décision malgré tout audacieuse pour la chanteuse, puisque Amazon est avant tout associé à des produits bon marché, comme le souligne Business of Fashion.  [/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_single_image image= »48818″][vc_column_text el_class= »legende »]Photo : Haus Laboratories. [/vc_column_text][vc_empty_space][vc_column_text] Lady Gaga est loin d'être la première célébrité à se lancer dans l'industrie très concurrentielle du maquillage. Il faut dire que le business peut s'avérer très lucratif et à de quoi séduire (même si Lady Gaga empoche déjà plus d'un millions de dollars par concert dans le cadre de sa résidence à Las Vegas avec son spectacle Enigma, qui se tiendra jusqu'au 16 mai 2020). Et ce n'est pas Rihanna – qui lançait en 2017 Fenty Beauty, une ligne de maquillage déjà fondée sur les principes d'inclusivité et de diversité et qui, a généré le chiffre d'affaires colossal de 500 millions d'euros dès sa première année – qui dira le contraire. Ni même Kim Kardashian ou sa petite sœur Kylie Jenner, qui revendiquait l'année dernière son statut de self-made milliardaire en Une du magazine Forbes, acquis, lui aussi, grâce à une marque de beauté : Kylie Cosmetics.

On Sunday, July 13, the singer brought her two sons, RZA, 3 and Riot, 23 months, for a special night out at the Smurfs premiere in Los Angeles. While the evening was a celebration of Rihanna's new acting gig — she voices Smurfette in the animated film — it also turned into a runway show once the trio stepped onto the carpet. The 37-year-old Fenty Beauty founder, who is expecting her third child with A$AP Rocky, made a statement in a bump-baring Saint Laurent Fall 2025 gown with lace cups, a full skirt and an olive green ribbon cinching her waist. She teamed it with a leather moto jacket and pink glam topped with a high bun.

The performer wasn't the only one stunting fresh-off-the-runway styles though. Turns out, her little ones were also dressed to the nines in miniature menswear looks drawn directly from Jonathan Anderson's first collection for Dior Homme, which debuted on June 27 during Paris Men's Fashion Week. Riot wore a custom toddler's version of one of Anderson's ensembles that featured a green single-breasted jacket, a white shirt with a matching bow tie and flared white shorts. Although, the model's fisherman sandals were traded out for adorable oxford shoes. RZA's outfit — which comprised of a pink button-up shirt and tie and dark green cargo pants — appeared to be an interpretation of one of the Dior runway designs. Arnold Jerocki/Getty Rihanna and A$AP Rocky at the ""Smurfs"" global premiere in Brussels on June 28, 2025 The family cuteness didn't stop at the three's coordinating looks. They shared many sweet moments during the event, including when RZA and Riot had a chance to meet Papa Smurf. During the interaction, the toddlers beamed with excitement as they were introduced to the famous Smurf character. Since announcing the news of her growing family at the 2025 Met Gala, Rihanna has not stopped showing up and showing out across the globe. She first kicked off the press tour for Smurfs in late June at the movie's global premiere in Brussels. She stepped out alongside Rocky, 36, who she was confirmed to be dating in 2020.

Rihanna mixed method dressing with maternity style in a sheer baby blue Chanel gown designed with an embellished peplum top that revealed her bump. The ""Sundress"" rapper repped a hint of blue on his tie, but kept the rest of his look subdued with a pinstripe button-up and black slacks. Before that, the couple, in addition to Riot, attended Paris Fashion Week in support of his brand AWGE's Spring/Summer 2026 show. Rihanna again proved her cool mom status in a preppy skin-baring look featuring a nearly unbuttoned striped shirt, pleated skirt and stilettos with socks. Riot, sitting front row with his mom, rocked a denim jacket with patchwork, sneakers and purple pants. Despite their busy schedules, Rihanna and Rocky are making family life work. Earlier this month, a source told PEOPLE exclusively that the pair ""couldn't be more thrilled"" about ""baby number three."" The insider added: ""They've really embraced this chapter and their bond has only deepened since becoming parents."""

Krugman (three-exposure theory), John Philip Jones (short-term advertising strength), Erwin Ephron (recency planning)     Summary: Media Saturation Threshold Theory identifies the point where additional ad exposures yield diminishing returns or backlash. It combines:     Effective Frequency: Minimum exposures needed for message retention (typically 3-10)    Wear-Out Effect: Creative fatigue causing irritation or tune-out    Category Norms: High-involvement products (cars) tolerate more frequency than low-involvement (snacks)      Optimal thresholds vary by:     Platform (TikTok ads wear out faster than OOH)    Creative (narrative spots last longer than repetitive jingles)    Audience (loyalists tolerate more exposures than new prospects)      Brand Examples:     BrewDog – Limited punk-themed YouTube pre-rolls to 4 exposures/month after data showed craft beer fans perceived higher frequency as ""selling out."" Chobani – Caps Greek yogurt TV spots at 5 exposures/week in key markets, using Nielsen data to balance reach and irritation. Dove Men+Care – Found 7 was the optimal monthly Facebook ad frequency for male audiences before negative sentiment spiked. Etsy – Uses A/B testing to determine handmade goods display ads peak at 3 impressions/user/week before click-through rates drop. Fenty Beauty – Rotates Instagram Story creatives every 72 hours to avoid makeup tutorial ad fatigue observed in Gen Z.      GoPro – Limits adventure sports YouTube ads to 2 exposures/user/month, as core users value ""authentic"" low-frequency messaging. Häagen-Dazs – Discovered luxury ice cream ads on Hulu perform best at 6 exposures over 2 weeks—higher frequencies cheapen the brand. Yeti – Outdoor gear digital ads follow a ""3-5-1"" rule: 3 creatives, 5 exposures max, 1-month cool-off period per audience segment."

  Adobe数据显示，美国在线销售在本周二（亚马逊Prime Day促销首日）同比大涨9.9%，达79亿美元，创下今年迄今为止“最大电商日”。 这一销售额不仅刷新了2024年记录，还超过了去年感恩节当天的61亿美元在线销售额。 回顾2023年和2024年的Prime会员日，全球销售表现可谓节节攀升。 2023年活动期间，全球Prime会员疯狂扫货超3.75亿件商品，首日甚至成为亚马逊史上单日销售最高的一天；2024年更是刷新纪录，全球第三方卖家仅用两天就卖出超2亿件商品。 Adobe Analytics预测，2025亚马逊Prime Day，美国在线消费（包括亚马逊和所有零售商）将达到238亿美元，比去年两天的142亿美元增长28.4%。 Prime Day首日，这些品类值得关注据媒体报道，2025年亚马逊Prime会员日在全球消费者的热切期待中盛大开启，首日战况异常激烈，众多卖家迎来爆单狂欢。 据亚马逊官方数据，全球销售额突破85亿美元，同比增长22%，远超2024年同期表现。 从品类维度拆解，电子产品以33%的销售额增速领跑全场，耳机、蓝牙扬声器等音频设备销量同比激增105%，部分品牌通过“Prime专享Z划算”活动实现单日销量翻20倍。 家居用品延续强势表现，泡沫床垫、洗衣液等大件商品交易总重量突破39吨，印证了亚马逊物流网络对高重量商品的承载能力。 值得关注的是，返校季商品成为黑马，背包、文具销售额飙升216%，儿童服装增长165%，显示出亚马逊对季节性消费节点的精准把控。 与往年48小时活动相比，2025年Prime Day首次延长至96小时，这一决策背后是亚马逊对流量分配机制的深度重构。 据Momentum Commerce分析，活动首六小时销售额同比增长13%，表明“开门红”效应显著；而延长周期使得长尾商品获得持续曝光机会，中小卖家通过“Z划算”活动实现日均销量增长300%。 尽管美国市场以78亿美元首日销售额占据绝对主导，但全球市场的分化趋势愈发明显。 Adobe预测，2025年Prime Day全球销售额将达238亿美元，其中美国贡献占比从2024年的78%微降至76%，而澳大利亚、印度等新兴市场增速显著。 数据显示，中国卖家的表现尤为亮眼。 欧洲站中国品牌SmallRig销量增长6.2倍，英国站Top10商品中中国品牌占据4席，显示出供应链优势与品牌化运营的双重效应。 在物流端，亚马逊AWD仓储服务通过“8折仓储费+9折运输费”的组合优惠，吸引超60%的中国卖家提前备货，确保活动期间库存周转率提升至行业均值的1.5倍。 接棒欧洲，TikTok Shop美区大促开启近日，TikTok Shop跨境电商欧洲夏季促销活动在英国以及欧盟四国（法国、德国、意大利、西班牙）正式完美收官。 据悉，此次促销中，欧盟四国成绩格外显著，多项数据创下新纪录。 尤其是欧盟四国商家自运营（POP）模式单日最高增幅超200%。 英区全托管商家GMV爆发超600%，商家自运营全周期GMV爆发超90%。 资料显示，这是TikTok Shop第二次举办夏季大促活动，而首次大促并未带来预期的销量增长。 据Modern Retail的数据，TikTok Shop在去年48小时的Prime Day促销中，商品交易总额（GMV）出现了6%的下滑。 外界普遍认为，去年促销的折扣力度较小是导致销量未达标的主要原因——当时TikTok Shop的平均折扣为18%，而亚马逊Prime Day的平均折扣则达到了22%。 然而，今年的情况发生了戏剧性的反转。 据悉，此次为期13天的TikTok大促（7月7日至7月19日）覆盖所有主流品类和知名品牌，包括Fenty Beauty、Crocs以及飞利浦等主力品牌，折扣力度高达50%。 特别是在TikTok Shop自行运营的POP模式下，欧盟四国市场的表现突破预期：其中自营商家单日峰值GMV增长超过200%，全周期GMV实现160%以上增长。 而平台达人内容也同步展现活力——达人直播成交同比增长达400%，短视频引导成交上涨215%，商品卡成交跃升135%，充分验证了内容电商在本地化运营下的巨大潜力。 同时，全托管模式（TOP）在欧洲同样取得显著成果。 欧盟市场TOP商家GMV当日激增122%，最高单日爆发也达200%。 而英国市场表现更为突出，全托管商家GMV同比增长超过600%。 尽管面临美国政府的加速出售压力，TikTok Shop美区市场仍展现出强劲的消费活力。 在6月的运营动荡中，静电除毛手套等应季商品逆势爆发，半月销量近万单，GMV 达6.65万美元，单条带货视频播放量突破600万次。 7月7日至19日，TikTok美区年中大促正式开启，护发精油、宠物用品等品类被平台列为重点推荐。 官方建议卖家提前储备短视频内容，并开通免费样品功能以应对潜在用户迁移风险。 据悉，此次大促沿用“内容+货架”双驱动模式，护发类商品凭借场景化测评视频转化率提升40%，宠物智能用品则依托达人开箱视频实现动销率超90%。 END来源：境商"

World's most followed accounts on twitter in 2025: X, which launched as Twitter in 2006 – a microblogging site for sharing fleeting thoughts – has grown into a global digital powerhouse. It has transformed how we engage with celebrities, world leaders, and everyday voices. Over time, it has become a modern public square, where influence is measured in followers, reposts, and viral threads. Since Elon Musk took the reins, the platform has seen its share of chaos, change, and controversy. Yet one thing has remained constant: the immense clout of those who top the follower charts. So, who rules X in 2025? From pop icons to tech titans, here's a look at the 10 most-followed accounts on the platform as of July 17, 2025. Top 10 most followed people on X in 2025 Lady Gaga – 81.8 million My 14th Grammy award is a very special one. Being a songwriter, all I want to do is tell stories that touch peoples hearts.

Here she talks us through her typical working day… By Nana Acheampong Save To My Favourites Image: @tobi. asare All products on this page have been selected by our editorial team, however we may make commission on some products. Borough Market 4.18am This is the exact time that my alarm goes off. I've calculated that gives me exactly enough time to be ready for the gym. I am woken up either by my phone alarm or my Whoop band. The first thing I do when I wake up is check my phone. It's bad, I know, but I need to check that there have been no disasters overnight that need my attention. I then brush my teeth and put on some SPF. Garnier Ambre Solaire SPF 50+ Sensitive Advanced Sun Cream Face & Body is my current go-to. My morning soundtrack is anything by Beyoncé, I love the latest album even more after seeing her live. I also take a shot of Symprove before I leave. 4.50am My gym is only a six-minute drive from my house. In summer I wear shorts and a bra top to work out in. Most of my kit comes from lululemon, Oner Active and Sweaty Betty. I work out a minimum of five times a week, mixing it up with cardio, strength training and PT sessions. When I am strength training, I wear Nike Metcons and for running, I wear Nike Journey. 6am I have my protein shake as soon as I get back from the gym. It's a mixture of protein powder, collagen and creatine with water. I then go and give my children a cuddle before heading into the shower. My favourite body wash is Naturium The Glow Getter  Body Wash  followed by the body butter. I go in quickly with a spritz of my favourite scent, Encelade by Marc-Antoine Barrois. On my face, I use Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant followed by Koba moisturiser. Make-up starts with Danessa Myricks Beauty Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder and I always use Fenty's  foundation – it's the best. I use the By Terry eye liner and I mix blushers from Merit and NARS. Finally, I set everything with Charlotte Tilbury's setting spray and in the evenings, I use the one from ONE/SIZE. 7am I'm definitely a magpie but my style is also defined by clean lines. I find Lisa Ing Marinelli's take on fashion really inspiring – she's someone who also has a corporate job but embraces her personal style. If I had an endless budget, I would go to Tove every season. I just bought one of my favourite summer dresses from the brand. I'm also a big fan of Rejina Pyo. On the high street, I love COS and Massimo Dutti. I only give myself about ten minutes to get dressed before I have to leave the house – either to get the kids to school or catch the train to work...."

Watch: Lili Reinhart Shares Alopecia Diagnosis No need the hypothesize about Lili Reinhart's new 'do. The alum showed off her newly-dyed brunette locks on social media as she prepares to film the upcoming adaptation of Ali Hazelwood's best-selling book , changing it up from her signature blonde look. Lili shared a photo of herself on Instagram July 17 holding up the book with her brown hair pulled back into a bun. In the selfie, the 28-year-old wears a lab coat in what appears to be a school lab, which tracks with her character Olive Smith being a biology PhD candidate. She further showed off her hair transformation over on TikTok, where she took part in the current trend set to PinkPantheress' ""Illegal,"" shaking hands with costar Tom Bateman while wearing jeans and a button-down shirt over a tank top, with her new brunette 'do still pulled back into a bun. ""third year phd student looking for a fake relationship,"" she wrote over herself in the video before writing ""hotshot professor who agrees to fake relationship"" over Tom, reflecting the story's plot. Lili captioned the video, ""hello Dr. Adam Carlsen,"" the name of her costar's character. While Tom will play her love interest in the upcoming project, the actress has been leaning on boyfriend Jack Martin for real life hurdles, like being diagnosed with interstitial cystitis, a condition that can cause pain in the bladder and pelvis, per the Mayo Clinic. “Never in my life could I have gotten through this without my partner,” she wrote on her Instagram Stories in January. “It's not easy to have a chronically ill girlfriend—when I spent months barely leaving the house, couldn't walk due to pain, and felt incredibly depressed due to the shift in my quality of life.” Lili added at the time, ""Jack's love and support has never waivered for a second during a time when my body was truly falling apart.” A few months earlier, Jack has also helped to through some of her mental health struggles, like by holding her hand through a particularly difficult October 2024 public appearance. “That's the ironic thing that people don't see,” she told  in an interview published in January. “I'm literally in Washington, D.C., at the White House giving a speech on mental health. And then that same night, I am sobbing, in so much discomfort, and feel so defeated.” What also helps her is knowing that her visibility could help other women going through similar situations feel seen. ""No one ever knows what that is when I talk about it,” Lili explained. “But my urogyno is telling me so many women have this, and that's why I think it's as important as it is to just be like, 'Hey, I'm dealing with it too.'” Keep reading for more stars' hair transformations...

Over the decades, ELLE has always celebrated beauty in all its forms, from groundbreaking cover moments like Rihanna's heart-shaped makeup in October 2017, marking the debut of Fenty Beauty, to viral stories like “The Truth About Crème de la Mer.” As we reminisce about some of our favorites, we also wanted to go behind the scenes of how it all happened. So we spoke with two previous beauty directors: Jean Godfrey-June, who worked at the magazine from 1994–2000, and Emily Dougherty, who served as beauty director for close to 20 years, beginning in 2002. Along with a selection of memorable covers from each decade, here's what they remember about working at ELLE, including sharing offices with a Kennedy, lunches with French movie stars, hiking African mountains, and the haircut that made people steal the cover of the magazine right off the newsstand. What was your most memorable beauty event? Jean Godfrey-June: Hermès once invited us out to New Jersey, and everybody was like, “New Jersey?!” A car brought us to a forest, and we got in carriages draped with Hermès Rocabar blankets, which brought us up through the hills. It was late fall, smelled like fire, and the sun was setting behind the trees. Actors in costume jumped out of the darkness to whisper to us about the different ingredients in the Rocabar scent. At the top of the hill, there were ancient stables from God knows when, all beautifully tiled. Hermès had made a table that ran the length of the stables, and they had hand-carved, not just the plates and platters and saucers for the dinner, but every fork and knife, too—all out of wood. The other one I really remember was when Gucci (during the Tom Ford era) came out with [the] Rush [perfume], and we were invited to an event at the Carlyle. I was directed up to a room, where I assumed there would be lots of PR people and a presentation—the usual fragrance event. Instead, I walk in, and there was just Tom Ford, sitting there on the bed. He patted it and said, “Come sit next to me.” We talked about perfume, the feeling of a rush, and sex, of course. It was definitely one of the sexiest experiences I've had that didn't involve actual sex. Emily Dougherty: Oh, there have been so many pinch-me moments. My stories would be re-published in ELLEs around the world, so I was often the only U.S. editor invited to global launches. For the launch of Alien, Mugler flew us on military transport from Cairo to the Siwa Oasis. We stayed at the base Adrère Amellal, a mountain where, at the very top, according to the brand, Alexander the Great was rumored to have been buried, and where one could find mysterious runes that inspired the letters cut into each bottle of Alien. We were given small silver amphoras filled with orange flower water to splash on our dusty hands and feet, and stayed in buildings made of translucent salt bricks that, lit only by candlelight, would flicker like fireflies. On the last day, I climbed to the top of the mountain before the sun rose. I didn't find Alexander's tomb or any runes, but I did find a petrified sand dollar the size of a salad plate, a reminder of the ancient Miocene sea, dry for seven million years. And rather than ship back the giant perfume factices—each over a foot tall—Mugler gave them to whomever would bring one home. So I carried the enormous purple crystal under my arm, like a model in a perfume ad, all the way back to the states. What were some of your favorite covers? ED: There are so many! But the first one I remember that really made an impact was a 2005 Heidi Klum cover. She has bleached hair and blunt bangs. People were ripping the cover off of ELLE in drugstores across the country to take to their hairstylist. They weren't even buying the issue. It really showed how powerful a haircut can be. What were the ELLE offices like? JGJ: [They had] unbelievable views, and JFK Jr. popping up from George downstairs to gossip. The scent of vetiver, Gilles Bensimon's [the former International Creative Director of ELLE] signature fragrance, that I could smell the second he got off the elevator. I'd be like, “He's here, guys.” Le Bernardin was a block away, so that was the very glamorous cafeteria. I once had lunch there with Gilles and Catherine Deneuve—I don't know why he included me, but he did—and I just about died. But I was once complaining about my dark circles to Bobbi Brown, and she was like, “Oh, you're looking at yourself in those ELLE bathroom mirrors! That's the worst lighting in the city!” ED: It was such a hodgepodge of incredibly luxurious things in a building that was so run-down. This was before we moved into the Hearst Tower. After a pipe broke, they were worried about mold, so they chopped the bottom of the drywall off across the entire floor. You could look down and see all the way over to ELLE Girl on the other side of the building. One ELLE Girl editor would bring her bunny to work, and it would hop through the drywall gaps. You'd be working at your desk, and the bunny would pop by for a visit. Every day, I got to wake up and go to a magical place where everybody was so in love with the subject that they were working on, whether it was beauty, fashion, books, or film. That's also what made ELLE so different—we had departments that focused on all aspects of culture...."

Enquanto o aplicava, ela explicou o raciocínio por trás da criação do brilho corporal. “Eu sei que vocês sabem o quanto eu amo esse produto. A inspiração por trás do molho corporal para mim foi que eu sempre ia ao Caribe – Barbados, de onde sou”, disse ela. “Toda vez eu sentava lá e fazia maquiagem com glitter para o corpo com óleo e sombras que eu esmagava. Eu simplesmente misturaria tudo para fazer essa coisinha linda e brilhante e teria que mantê-la em um copo de plástico durante toda a viagem. Sempre pensei que nunca conseguiria encontrar a maquiagem corporal perfeita, então fiz molho corporal e é glorioso.” Cortesia da Amazon Esta maquiagem corporal proporciona um brilho de aparência saudável que é super fácil de aplicar quando você está pronto para mostrar um pouco de pele.

After a series of 1980s films (which were followed by 2011 and 2013 movies starring Katy Perry and Jonathan Winters), the little blue creatures are getting rebooted with Smurfs, which hit theaters on July 18. In the film, the evil Gargamel continues his mad quest to destroy Smurf Village, kidnapping Papa Smurf (John Goodman) and forcing the rest of the Smurfs to go on a wild adventure to save him. But their journey takes them to some pretty unexpected places, including major real-life cities like Paris. Goodman is joined by Rihanna, who plays the iconic Smurfette and even provides the movie's soundtrack with a brand-new song. “Having Rihanna on board was amazing,” director Chris Miller told Variety in July 2025. “When we first met with her, we learned that the Smurfs was her favorite show growing up, and from that moment, everything just clicked. It felt completely natural to reimagine the Smurfs for today's audience with Rihanna as Smurfette because her genuine love for the franchise made her the perfect fit.” Smurfs has over a dozen stars voicing the characters, including Oscar, Emmy, Grammy and Golden Globe winners like Nick Offerman, Amy Sedaris, Jimmy Kimmel, Octavia Spencer and more.

Their talents have caused them to become one of the best, if not the best, in their fields. It can range from cosmetology, fashion, music, to the media industry, but at this point, these women áre their brand. Find out who the female celebs are on the Forbes list for 2025. It's worth noting that to be included in this compendium of 100 women, the 16 celebrities had to have a net worth of at least $350 million, compared to $300 million last year and $225 million in 2023. Katy Perry opted for eccentricity and arrived at the event wearing a dress made up of several backpack compartments, including a sports bag as a skirt. The pop diva took the opportunity to promote her new work, using a QR code printed on her hand that people could scan. This 71-year-old American from rural Mississippi is number 13 on the list, with a net worth of $3.1 billion. Winfrey came from the bottom of the ladder and overcame a difficult childhood, as her mother was still a teenager when she was born. Late in 2023, Oprah also announced that she was taking one of the popular new weight loss medications. ""The fact that there's a medically approved prescription for managing weight and staying healthier, in my lifetime, feels like relief, like redemption, like a gift, "" she told People, adding that she also follows a healthy lifestyle, but doesn't feel like she needs to ""prove she has the willpower "" to stay thin anymore. Her famous show became a media and business empire. Even though it's been off the air for more than 14 years, she has been active on television with specials and Netflix films, such as 'The Six Triple Eight.' Among her other assets is a real estate portfolio with homes in California and more than a dozen properties, including 850 hectares of land in Hawaii. At the age of 9, Oprah moved to Milwaukee with her mother. There, she became the victim of assaults by a cousin and other relatives. As a talk show host, actress, and writer, she has often talked about her experiences as a victim of abuse. This 44-year-old celebrity occupies 19th place on this list with a net worth of $1.7 billion. Kanye West's ex-wife capitalized on her reality TV fame, which is why, among other things, she boasts some of the most followed social media pages in the world, with 5 million followers on Twitter and 362 million on Instagram. Another of her mentors also asserted that thanks to Kardashian, some inmates have been pardoned, and that she has also helped reunite families. ""She has fought to reunite families and bring national attention to the most complex aspects of our national legal system, "" she stated. Her fortune primarily comes from her stake in Skims, her shapewear business, which is valued at $4 billion. In February, the clothing company unveiled NikeSkims, a new brand allied with the sports empire, whose offering is expected to hit store shelves in a few months. The mentor also specified that Kardashian accumulated more than 5,000 hours of study. ""Kim has dedicated 18 hours a week, 48 weeks a year for six straight years. That's 5,148 hours of legal study. That's time she carved out while raising four children, running businesses, filming television shows, and showing up in courtrooms to advocate for others, "" she asserted. At 35 years old, she's ranked 21st with a net worth of $1.6 billion. Thanks to her 'Eras' tour, which ended in December 2024 as the most successful in music history, this singer became a billionaire in October 2023. The tour grossed over $2 billion in ticket sales. The global success of 'The Eras Tour', the ever-increasing value of her song catalog, plus royalties and real estate assets, have pushed the 'Shake It Off' singer past Rihanna, who previously held the top spot. In addition to being a performer, she's a successful businesswoman, having capitalized on her fans, yes, through ticket sales, but also through film, book, and album re-recordings, which have earned her more than $200 million in the last two years. Swift is the first artist to enter the billionaire ranking based primarily on her songs and performances. Following the devastating impact of hurricanes Milton and Helene in the southern United States, several celebrities have donated money or music for the reconstruction of affected areas and to aid the victims of this terrible disaster. Among them is one of the richest stars in the world, Taylor Swift. A net worth of $1 billion places this 37-year-old singer and businesswoman at number 35 out of the 100 on this list. A Barbados native, Rihanna is a multimillionaire thanks to the success of her Fenty Beauty cosmetics line. By the way, did you know that Fenty is the last name of this performer, who was discovered by Jay-Z as a teenager? In this new film in the franchise, which will hit theaters next July, Rihanna also lends her voice to the character of Smurfette and is an executive producer on the project. The cosmetics company, which she co-owns with French luxury chain LVMH, doubled its revenue in 2022. Its assets also include an estimated 28 percent stake in the Savage x Fenty lingerie line.

mov_161D74D2CBDFD8D77F3E3AD63CBFC8B0,2025-07-20 00:16:02,en,WEB,"  After breaking up with her billionaire fiancé, Mariah Carey reportedly sued him for a $50 million ""inconvenience fee!"" According to Forbes, there are 3,028 billionaires in the world as of 2025. While that number may have average people shouting, ""Eat the rich!"" , some celebrities see it as a potential dating pool. Here are 35 celebrities who dated or married billionaires and their heirs: 1. Camila Cabello was first romantically linked to Henry Junior Chalhoub — who's an heir to the billionaire Chalhoub family — in January 2025. The Chalhoub family founded the Chalhoub Group, a distribution company for luxury fashion. It's based in Dubai. According to Forbes, the family was worth $1.7 billion as of 2019. 2. After a few months of dating, Mariah Carey got engaged to investor James Packer in 2016. They broke up eight months later. According to Forbes, his net worth is $3.4 billion. Following their split, Mariah reportedly sued James for a $50 million ""inconvenience fee"" but settled in the neighborhood of $5–$10 million. She also got to keep her $10 million engagement ring. 3. From 2018–2022, Kaley Cuoco was married to equestrian Karl Cook, the son of Intuit founder Scott Cook. According to Forbes, Scott's net worth is $7.7 billion. In 2016, Kaley and Karl met at a horse show and bonded over their mutual love of animals. In 2021, they announced they were separating because they ""realized that [their] current paths have taken [them] in opposite directions."" 4. A$AP Rocky has been with billionaire singer and businessperson Rihanna since 2020. In 2021, Forbes reported that she achieved billionaire status largely through Fenty Beauty, the makeup brand she launched in partnership with LVMH in 2017. Another large chunk of her wealth — in the neighborhood of $270 million — comes from her stake in Savage x Fenty, the lingerie brand she started in 2018. She's reportedly worth $1 billion. 5. Before becoming a billionaire herself, Rihanna dated Hassan Jameel from 2017–2020. His family — who own the largest Toyota distribution company in several parts of the Middle East, Abdul Latif Jameel — was reportedly worth a collective $2.2 billion in 2017. 6. In 2018, Karlie Kloss married billionaire venture capitalist Josh Kushner. He founded the firm Thrive Capital in 2009 and has invested in companies like Instagram, Instacart, Zola, and Robinhood. Per Forbes, he's worth $3.8 billion. 7. Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has been dating billionaire singer Taylor Swift since 2023. According to Forbes, Taylor was the first musician to achieve billionaire status predominantly through her music and performances. She was added to the list in October 2023, largely because of her music catalog and the Eras Tour. Her net worth is $1.6 billion. 8. In 2019, YouTube star Gigi Gorgeous married model/designer Nats Getty, who's the great-grandson of oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. Forbes clocked the Getty family's net worth at $5.4 billion in 2015.

urn:li:share:7352684138874728448,2025-07-20 13:01:45,en,LINKEDIN,"  How are your customers' trust patterns dependent on your brand color choices? Why is tech always blue, finance obsessed with green, and food/retail addicted to red, orange, and yellow? This isn't just design. It's color psychology meeting consumer trust patterns. And every industry leans into it, intentionally. Let's break it down: → Tech = Blue Blue signals intelligence, trust, and calm. It creates a sense of security, perfect for companies managing your data, identity, or future. Brands like IBM, Intel Corporation, Meta, and LinkedIn all use it to say: “We're stable. You're safe.” → Finance = Green Green connects to money, growth, and reassurance. It's both literal and emotional, invoking prosperity, steadiness, and renewal. Used by companies like Fidelity Investments, TD, and Mint to subtly reinforce financial well-being. → Retail & Food = Red Red drives action. It increases appetite, creates urgency, and attracts immediate attention. Fast food, retail sales, and entertainment brands? Red is everywhere. Think The Coca-Cola Company, Netflix, Target, McDonald's. → Luxury = Black Black is power. Sophistication. Timeless elegance. It doesn't beg for attention, it commands it. Luxury brands like CHANEL, Prada Group, and Rolls-Royce use it to say: “This isn't for everyone.” → Wellness & Beauty = Soft pinks, beige, and muted tones These colors evoke a sense of calm, warmth, and subtlety. They encourage trust and emotional ease, key for skincare, wellness, and beauty brands. Glossier, Inc., Savage X Fenty, and Aesop are all built on these soft signals. → Sustainability & Ethical Brands = Earthy greens and browns These hues reflect nature, purity, and authenticity. They communicate grounded values and ethical responsibility. Think Patagonia, The Honest Company, Whole Foods Market. → Crypto, Web3, AI = Purple, gradients, futuristic tones Purple signals imagination, innovation, and depth. Often mixed with neon gradients, it positions brands as next-gen, visionary, and untethered from tradition. Brands like OpenAI, Discord, and Avalanche heavily lean in this direction. Color isn't decoration. It's a strategy. It's psychology. It's positioning. It's the first thing your audience feels, before they read a single word. If your brand's colors are chosen by “what looks cool,” instead of “what builds belief,” You may already be misunderstood. Color isn't just about standing out, it's about fitting in, where it matters most.
