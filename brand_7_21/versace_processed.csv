I just bought a $60 bottle of Versace and it seems to last longer. Trying to get away from the cheap Amazon dandruff shampoo and body wash now.

mov_CB14AF1277187658CF3FBC906960F540,2025-07-14 16:58:54,fr,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Avec l'arrivée des beaux jours, une myriade de festivals s'apprête à pimenter les week-ends à venir jusqu'à la rentrée prochaine, sur tout le territoire français. Antidote offre ici un petit tour d'horizon des meilleurs d'entre eux, et a sélectionné les meilleurs looks disponibles sur le site de Zalando pour y assister. Les Eurockéennes : le plus éclectique Organisées depuis 1989 par l'association à but non lucratif Territoire de Musiques, sur le site naturel de la presqu'île de Malsaucy, près de Belfort, dans l'est de la France, les Eurockéennes se tiendront cette année du jeudi 29 juin au dimanche 2 juillet. Une fois n'est pas coutume, cette 33ème édition sera marquée par la nouveauté et un line-up éclectique, mettant en avant une grande diversité de styles musicaux et mélangeant artistes établi·e·s et émergeant·e·s. Cette année, plus de 80 % des artistes programmé·e·s se produiront d'ailleurs pour la première fois aux Eurockéennes. Répartis sur quatre jours et quatre scènes, les 52 concerts en plein air seront le fruit d'une programmation transversale et pointue. Le jeudi 29 juin, la rappeuse britannique Shygirl montera sur scène pour interpréter ses titres corrosifs aux connotations sexuelles explicites, tout comme le DJ Skrillex, qui faisait son retour en février dernier avec un nouvel album, ou encore le célèbre rappeur Niska. 070 Shake, Orelsan et Meryl seront quant à eux·elles à l'affiche du festival le lendemain, avant de passer le relai à Lomepal, Dinos, Pomme, Lous & The Yakuza, Kungs, Jeanne Added ou encore Vladimir Cauchermar le samedi 1er juillet. Puis le dimanche, le festival se clôturera avec un concert du groupe culte Indochine.  Ponctué par des mini-événements baptisés « Eurocks Special », mêlant danse contemporaine, shows musicaux de personnalités de la culture queer ou encore dancehall, ce festival éclectique mixant « grandes signatures internationales », « gars sûrs du hip-hop », « pop inspirée » et « électro énervée » sera parfait pour arborer un look aux accents rock et reflétant la grande diversité de styles et de labels disponibles sur Zalando.

Le Main Square Festival : le plus rap Prenant place chaque année dans le nord de la France, au sein de la citadelle d'Arras construite au XVIIème siècle par Vauban et classée au patrimoine mondial de l'Unesco, le Main Square Festival se tiendra du 30 juin au 2 juillet prochains. Pour cette 17ème édition, la programmation fera la part belle au rap et au hip-hop avec, parmi les plus grosses têtes d'affiches, les rappeurs belges Hamza et Damso, qui figurent sur le line-up au côté d'Orelsan, autre poids lourd du rap francophone. Tiakola et Macklemore seront également de la partie, tout comme Aya Nakamura, chanteuse francophone la plus écoutée dans le monde, qui ne manquera pas d'ambiancer les festivalier·ère·s avec ses toplines entêtantes. Organisé autour de trois scènes, la Main Stage, la Green Room et le Bastion, le Main Square Festival mettra autant en avant des stars internationales telles que David Guetta et Maroon 5, que des talents plus émergeants, tel·le·s que BBNO$ ou Cloud. Un line-up idéal pour se composer des looks aux accents street, infusés de l'esthétique Y2K, actuellement en plein revival. Les pièces du label Juicy Couture – dont les tracksuits en velours ornés de strass ont habillé Paris Hilton dans les années 2000 – seront ainsi un choix tout indiqué, et pourront être associées à des sneakers Nike ou New Balance, des bijoux audacieux et des lunettes de soleil iconiques, pour en prendre plein les yeux sans pour autant être aveuglé·e.

Depuis, cinq éditions se sont succédées, avec des programmations toujours plus impressionnantes, réunissant des stars internationales telles que The Weeknd, Megan Thee Stallion ou encore A$AP Rocky. Planifié pour la première fois sur trois jours – au lieu de deux –, l'édition parisienne de ce festival également organisé à Chicago, Berlin, São Paulo, Buenos Aires, Santiago et Stockholm promet d'être encore plus frénétique cette année, avec une soixantaine d'artistes au programme. Du 21 au 23 juillet, Rosalía, Kendrick Lamar, Aya Nakamura, Lil Nas X, Central Cee, Ava Max, Ckay ou encore Damso se succèderont sur scène à l'Hippodrome Paris Longchamp.

tw_sl_b4dfa2db243772d27e925db70bfc33a8,2025-07-14 18:03:04,en,WEB,"  Jahmere Weekley Jadarius Weekley Barbee DECATUR — The story of three Decatur men, a gun and a gunshot wound took awhile to untangle, but police said it ended up with all three being charged with weapons offenses. Sworn affidavits say patrol officers had been alerted by HSHS St. Mary's Hospital on the evening of July 8 after 20-year-old Jahmere K. Weekley was dropped off by his brother, Jadarius D. Weekley, 22. Jahmere had a gunshot wound to his left thigh and Officer Joshua Davis, who signed one of the affidavits, said the victim at first claimed he had been shot by an unknown assailant while walking in the area of East Cleveland and South Illinois streets. People are also reading… Davis said police immediately had their doubts as there was no trace of a crime scene in the area Weekley described. “After not locating a crime scene, officers analyzed the pictures taken of Jahmere's injury and the interior of the vehicle where Jahmere was sitting,” Davis said. “Officers observed the injuries to Jahmere's left thigh to be consistent with a possible self-inflicted gunshot wound. Officers observed a gunshot defect to the side of the center console (of the brother's car) where Jahmere was sitting.” When police went back to the victim's brother to check the details, a very different story emerged. After initially claiming his brother had just called him for help after being shot, Jadarious Weekley later changed his story to say they had both been visiting the home of 22-year-old Shawn A. Barbee, a friend since childhood. “Jadarius said Shawn gave him and Jahmere a black 9mm handgun to play with,” Davis said. The two men had then left with the gun in Jadarius' car and, while driving by the Boys & Girls Club in the 800 block of North Jasper Street, “Jahmere accidentally shot himself in the leg with the handgun,” Davis added. Jahmere said he had taken his brother to the hospital before driving off to clean up the passenger seat and get rid of the spent shell casing from the shot. He then returned to the hospital and found himself confronted by the police. Jahmere eventually confirmed his brother's version of events but Davis said Jadarius then went and changed the story again. This time he claimed his brother had originally found the gun dumped in a field south of the Moundford Terrace apartments. Barbee, for his part, described the two brothers as friends he had grown up with but denied ever giving them a handgun as a plaything. Police didn't believe Barbee's story and he ran into more trouble after his home in the 2400 block of Hedrick Court was searched. Another sworn affidavit lists items seized to include a suppressor/silencer and an auto sear device which converts a handgun into a submachine gun. Barbee appeared July 9 in Macon County Circuit Court and was arraigned on a charge of the unlawful delivery of a weapon to a felon. Jahmere Weekley was arraigned July 10 on a charge of the aggravated unlawful possession of a weapon; both defendants were granted pretrial release by Judge Lindsey Shelton. Jadarius Weekley was arraigned July 9 on a charge of the aggravated unlawful possession of a weapon but this time Shelton ruled he was too dangerous to be given his freedom and ordered him to remain jailed. All three defendants are due back in court July 23 for preliminary hearings when they will enter pleas to the charges. Unfortunately, some stars are taken from us in terrible ways. Here are five celebrities who were murdered and how they died. 1. John Lennon John Lennon was shot four times by Mark David Chapman outside his apartment building in New York City on December 8, 1980. 2. Gianni Versace The renowned fashion designer and founder of Versace was shot by Andrew Cunanan, a serial killer, on the steps of his mansion in Florida in 1997. 3. Tupac Shakur The influential rapper was shot four times by an unknown assailant in a drive-by shooting in Las Vegas in 1996. He died six days later. 4. Brittany Murphy The Clueless star was found unconscious by her husband at their home in 2009. She died of pneumonia, anemia and drug intoxication. Five months later, her husband also died from similar causes. Though their deaths were ruled as accidental, some believe they were murdered. 5. Marvin Gaye The legendary singer was shot by his father, Marvin Gay Sr., who had a history of domestic violence, at their home in Los Angeles in 1984. Counties with the most gun deaths Counties With the Most Gun Deaths Photo Credit: Prath / Shutterstock Over the past few years, the U.S. has seen sharply increasing levels of violent crime. After two decades of decreases beginning in the mid-1990s, incidents have begun to rise again. Within the last two years, the trend has become especially pronounced. FBI data recently showed a 5.6% increase in violent crime from 2019 to 2020, even as rates of property crime continued to decline. In the same year, the murder rate rose by around 30%, one of the largest year-over-year increases on record. Guns are closely tied to this trend in the U.S...."

Over the next ten years, the platform grew to have more than 300 million users. The online microblogging site was launched by Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams and Biz Stone. Also on this day in 1997, Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace was murdered by serial killer Andrew Cunanan. As part of ' History Today series, here's a look at what happened on July 15: STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD Twitter was launched On this day in 2006, Twitter, now called X, was launched as Odeo's side project that let users send short status updates to groups of friends by texting a single number. In the years that followed, Twttr became Twitter, and the simple idea of “microblogging” quickly gained popularity. It went on to become one of the top social media platforms in the world. The online microblogging site was launched by Jack Dorsey, Evan Williams and Biz Stone. Reuters/File Photo Notably, Jack Dorsey came up with the idea of letting people send personal updates through SMS to groups. Six months after the launch, Twttr became Twitter. When it was made public, its creators added a 140-character limit to messages, which matched the standard length of a text message at the time. This was later changed to 280 characters. By 2013, the reported that Twitter had more than 2,000 staff members and over 200 million active users. In November that year, the company went public with a value of just over $31 billion. Twitter had a big role in influencing politics and culture in the early 21st century. In April 2022, a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission showed plans for Twitter to merge with one of Elon Musk's companies, X Holdings. After Musk bought Twitter in October 2022, he began the process of merging it with X and changing its brand. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS ADElon Musk bought Twitter in October 2022. Reuters/File Photo The merger with X Corp. was completed in April 2023. In a court document filed in California in early April 2023, it was stated that Twitter, as a company, “no longer exists.” Gianni Versace was killed On this day in 1997, world-famous Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace was shot and killed by Andrew Cunanan outside his mansion in Miami. Versace was hit twice in the head, and Cunanan ran away from the scene. Notably, Cunanan had no past criminal record before he began a string of killings in Minneapolis in the spring of 1997. With the FBI already searching for him, Cunanan travelled to Miami Beach. On July 11, a fast-food worker recognised him, but police got there too late. Four days later, he shot Versace dead outside his South Beach home. World-famous Italian fashion designer Gianni Versace was shot in 1997. AFP/File Photo Both Cunanan and Versace were openly gay and moved in similar social groups, but police found no proof they had ever met. Versace's murder led to a major manhunt for Cunanan, who was known for changing his look in every photo. On July 23, the search ended just 40 blocks from Versace's mansion, on a houseboat that Cunanan had broken into. STORY CONTINUES BELOW THIS AD There, police found him dead from a self-inflicted gunshot. The weapon matched the one used in two other killings. He did not leave a note.

ac838b6c505130ab7e954b9ed5eeb6b1,2025-07-15 04:22:00,hr,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[hr]Gianni Versace (50) upravo je otključao vrata svog doma nakon doručka u News Caféu na Ocean Driveu. Čuveni dizajner i vlasnik najpoznatijeg talijanskog visokomodnog brenda tog dana sam se zaputio do trgovine ne bi li kupio talijanske novine, što je inače umjesto njega radio osobni asistent. Došao je pred kuću, krenuo se penjati stubama prema ulaznim vratima kad mu je s leđa prišao naoružani muškarac. Prošlo je točno 28 godina tragične smrti ikone modne industrije Giannija Versacea. S dva hica iz pištolja ubijen je na stepenicama svoje viel Casa Casuarina u Miami Beachu 15. srpnja 1997. godine. Kad je trebao ući u vilu, Andrew Cunanan je u njega ispalio dva hica - jednim mu je raznio lice, a drugi metak je završio u vratu. Pored Giannijeva tijela pronađena je mrtva ptica te se dugo sumnjalo da se mafija zbog dugova konačno obračunala s njim i ostavila pticu kao poruku. Međutim, naposljetku se ispostavilo da je komadić metka sluačajno pogodio životinju i sumnje vezane za mafiju pale su u vodu. Bilo je to djelo Cunanana, homoseksualca koji je za život zarađivao kao svojevrsni žigolo. Točnije, njegova strategija bila je da se skompa sa starijim bogatašima te od njih muze novac i poklone. Nakon što je u dva tjedna počinio pet ubojstava kroz nekoliko američkih saveznih država, Cunanana su pronašli na brodici u luci, nedaleko od Versacijeve vile. Počinio je suicid istim pištoljem kojim je obavio svih pet krvavih zločina. Iza Versacijeve smrti ostalo je modno carstvo vrijedno 685 milijuna dolara, 130 butika diljem svijeta i kompanija koja je dosegnula milijunske prihode, i to svega u nekoliko godina. Poznati logo carstva Versace, okrugli znak s Meduzinom glavom, posveta je onome što je Giannija oduvijek inspiriralo. A to su grčka i rimska kultura, Etrušćani i talijanski barok te je sve njih na ovaj ili onaj način provukao kroz svoje kolekcije. Gianni, sestra Donatella i brat Santo odrastali su u talijanskoj regiji Calabriji u stanu iznad majčine šnajderske radnje, dok se otac bavio prodajom ugljena. Ali majka Francesca nije bila tek obična švelja. Prije svega, bila je poduzetnica koja je upošljavala pedesetak šivačica. Njezin salon Elle krojio je i šivao za onodobnu talijansku gospodu. Giannija je njegova ljubav prema modi privukla vrlo rano. Već se s devet godina motao po majčinoj radnji i promatrao kako nastaju njezine modne kreacije, a svoj prvi primjerak haljine sašio je 1955. godine. ""Dizajniranje je došlo k meni. Nisam morao nikud ići"", izjavio je jednom. Jednako tako bilo je s Donatellom koja je od njega mlađa 11 godina. Ali gonjen svojim životnim pozivom, i to nakon studija arhitekture, 1972. godine Gianni odlazi u Milano gdje honorarno kreira za poznate talijanske modne kuće, a već 1978. godine pokreće svoje carstvo Versace. Odmah zapošljava brata Santosa, koji je dotad već diplomirao menadžment i kojeg postavlja za direktora kompanije, dok je Donatella bila zadužena za glazbu, kreativne ideje i cijelu vizualno-glazbenu priču Giannijevih revija. Kažu da mu je bila muza, dok je Santo bio idejni začetnik modnog brenda koji će pokoriti ono što je dotad bilo smatrano visokom modnom industrijom. Vrlo brzo se zahuktala priča s Giannijem Versacijem. Njegove ideje donijele su pravo osvježenje na talijansku scenu kojom su dotad vladali klasični i samozatajni krojevi Giorgija Armanija. Kao šakom u oku, Gianni je počeo propagirati spoj moderne umjetnosti sa štihovima stare grčke kulture, a utjecaj rock glazbe u njegovim kolekcijama bio je tad presedan u modernom dizajnu. Pokorio je talijanske piste i tržište uskim i kratkim mini suknjama blještavih boja i dotad nekorištenih materijala, a kaže da su ga inspirirale talijanske prostitutke. Kao jedan od velikih poklonika umjetnosti, a sve je poteklo iz činjenice da je regija iz koje je došao nekad davno bila grčka kolonija, u svojim domovima skupljao je sve, od najsuvremenijih umjetničkih djela (posebno je volio Andyja Warhola) pa do grčkih statua. Osim toga, započeo je s novim tehnologijama u izradi odjeće pa je tako posebnim metodama spajao gumu i kožu u ekstravagantne odjevne predmete, kombinirajući tako talijanski barok sa suvremenim izričajem. Rock glazba bila je njegov unutarnji pogon, a Umjetnik ili Prince bio je pop-rock ikona koja je često stvarala glazbu za njegove revije. Ali ne samo on: prijateljevao je s Eltonom Johnom, Madonnom za koju je uredio poseban salon u crvenom i zlatnom gdje je odsjedala u njegovoj kući, Courtney Love te gomilom drugih zvijezda i zvjezdica koji su obilježili devedesete. Često ga se moglo vidjeti na večerama s Tupacom Shakurom, Stingom... Taj eklektični spoj moćnog rocka i njegove vizije onoga kako bi suvremena moda trebala izgledati donio je sasvim novu svježinu na već pomalo ustaljenu i dosadnjikavu svjetsku modnu scenu. Gianni Versace unio je sasvim nove pojmove mode u svijet pa je tako jako inzistirao na tome da mu u prvim redovima na revijama sjede Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista i Kate Moss. I na taj način povezao je ono što je nekad bila visoka moda rezervirana samo za najuži krug ljudi na sceni u jedinstvenom miksu glazbe, mode i umjetnosti. Na svoj način doveo je pojam supermodela na visok nivo. Moramo li naglasiti činjenicu da je haljinu koju je sašio sa samo devet godina nakon četrdeset godina u novoj verziji nosila princeza Diana za jedan fotoshooting? Njegova neiscrpna i neutaživa glad za umjetnošću i književnošću dovela je do toga da je ovaj eklektični dizajner zapošljavao na puno radno vrijeme i vlastitog knjižničara koji se brinuo o njegovih pet veličanstvenih privatnih knjižnica! ""Nerijetko ga se moglo vidjeti okruženog s 50-ak knjiga koje su ležale po sofama i stolu dok je ugošćavao prijatelje"", rekla je Anna Wintour u jednom intervjuu. I u vrijeme kad je gay populacija još čučala duboko u svojim ormarima, Gianni je bio otvoren po pitanju svoje homoseksualnosti. Još 1982. Gianni je upoznao Antonija D'Amica, talijanskog modela, koji je s vremenom postao kreator Sports divizije u Versacijevu carstvu. Njihova veza trajala je dugih 15 godina, sve dok Gianni u svojoj pedesetoj nije tragično završio pred vratima svoje vile Casa Casuarina. ""Čuo sam pucanj. Srce mi je prestalo kucati"", izjavio je Giannijev partner koji je u vrijeme ubojstva bio u kući. Gianni je Antoniju oporučno ostavio doživotnu mirovinu od 26.000 dolara mjesečno te pravo na boravak u bilo kojoj Versaceovoj rezidenciji, ali su mu Donatella i Santo tijekom ostavinskih rasprava osporili to pravo te time na neki način ignorirali želju svojega brata...."

July 15, 2025, 1:05am Macy's may be holding on to its longtime position as the top U.S. retailer by share of fragrance sales, but plenty of other shifts are afoot when it comes to who's winning the category. According to YipitData, Macy's accounted for 31.8 percent of fragrance sales during the month of May, indicating a 14.7-point lead from the category's next-biggest retailer during the period, Ulta Beauty. While significant, that lead is several points less than it was, say, two years prior in 2023, when Macy's accounted for more than 40 percent of fragrance sales during the same month. This shift is in part due to the nascent growth of alternative fragrance retailers as formidable competitors in the space. There's Amazon, which, per YipitData, accounted for 14.9 percent of fragrance sales in May across the platform's first- and third-party sellers (tracking after Sephora, which accounted for 15.5 percent during the same period). TikTok Shop, too, wasn't on the map at all in the U.S. until halfway through 2023, yet today the e-tailer — which has propelled brands from Lattafa to Phlur to virality — goes head-to-head with Target in terms of share of fragrance sales, actually outpacing Target slightly in May. Year-to-date, the top three fragrance brands at Sephora have been Kayali, Sol de Janeiro and YSL Beauty, in that order. For the month of May, Valentino overtook YSL for the number-three spot, while in April, Chanel's Chance Eau Splendide Eau de Parfum was the retailer's top-selling new stock keeping unit across the store. On Amazon, which YipitData reports has gained modest but steady share in fragrance since 2023, winning brands range from value-driven to designer, a dynamic which the platform's top two brands in May — Lattafa and Versace — quintessentially represent. Other top 10 brands on Amazon include Sol de Janeiro, Nautica and Dior (which, like all brands owned by LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, does not officially sell on the platform). So far in 2025, fragrance has been the fastest-growing category in beauty, as has been the case since 2021. According to Circana, the category grew 4 percent in the prestige market and 8 percent in mass during the first quarter of this year. The top 10 retailers by share of fragrance sales in May 2025, per YipitData. 1. Macy's 31.8 percent 2. Ulta Beauty 17.1 percent 3. Sephora 15.5 percent 4.

1m0att1,2025-07-15 06:52:02,en,REDDIT,"  Alpha twins stared at me once I came to the party.What the hel?I didn't even know them.Next second I heard my fiance Jax growled.He wrapped his arm around my waist and crouched down to kiss my cheek.Then two loud snarls came beside, stiffening everyone around us,That very moment I looked up and locked eyes with twins.The audible hitch in their breath couldn't be missed.What's wrong with them?Chapter 1Lyla's POV:Going down the spiral staircase, I see my brother Lars, the eldest and Alpha of our pack: the Bloodmoon Pack. Sitting across him are Kadien, Aiden and Fiden: my triplet brothers.Usually, the triplets don't care about my behaviour and hardly ever have a talk with me, but from the seething expressions of my four dear elder brothers, I was in trouble. Climbing down the last step, I walk into the main lounge and put up a smile and go up to Lars. ""Hey there, pal. What's up?"" I said. In response, I got a death glare, not from one person but four. ""Mind telling us why you and Ashely Migwire fought today. And, what was so bad that you knocked her out, plus giving her a concussion, broken nose and a split lip?"" Said Lars, seething. I swear I could see smoke from his ears coming out.It wasn't always like this! I hated fighting with people; hell, I hated the sight of blood, but everything had changed since that dreadful day.On my fifteenth birthday, a rogue attack shattered everything. What began as a peaceful morning run with Mom and Daddy ended in blood and loss. They died protecting me, torn apart by silver blades. I woke three days later from a coma from the sliver poisoning; how I survived, no one knows. My parents were buried, Lars had to return from alpha camp early and take over.And, I became the target of some pack members, claiming I was the reason for my parent's death. But my brthers did nothing.I never lacked anything, whether money, bags, clothes or whatever else; our pack was filthy rich, but what I needed at the time to heal my broken heart was not given: my brother's care and protection.I was broken out of my thoughts when Lars cleared his throat. Unconsciously, my hand went to the scar on my shoulder that was left by the knife that day. Lars had caught the movement, and his eyes softened a bit; even the triplets sighed in helplessness. It was a thing I did; whenever I remembered that day, my hand was automatically there, a permanent reminder of that day.Sighing, Lars came forward and hugged me and said,""Look, Lyla, this is the tenth fight you've gotten into this month. This has to stop. Bloodmoon is your family; everyone loves you. You need to stop this. You are part of the alpha family, our only sister and the female Alpha of this pack. You need to be a role model, not some wayward."" He finished.If only he knew. I had never told any of my brothers about the bullying; when it started, they were so busy trying to control everything that they hardly ever had time. I didn't want to put additional tension on their heads. Over time, I got used to it and learned to fight back. But, now it was getting annoying. Did they only see quirks in me and not the other person? Why was I always blamed? Couldn't the other person have done something? Untangling myself from Lars, I looked at him and my other brothers. ""Did you ever think that maybe it could be Ashley's fault and she deserved what she got?"" I said.I heard them sigh and shake their heads, probably in disappointment. Well, there's a familiar gesture I get to see a lot nowadays. ""L, even if that is the case, what about the other nine times? All the people you had gotten into fights with were from that group, and you left everyone literally battered and bruised. You know you have pure alpha blood running in you, and you are stronger than them. So how is it fair?"" Said Kaiden""He's right, L; things have gotten out of hand now. You're starting to scare people in the pack. No one blamed you over the years because of what happened; you were traumatized, and at the time, we thought that this was your way of dealing with things, but this, this is just bat-shit crazy, L. You gave her a concussion, and she's yet to wake up. You know she isn't eighteen and does not heal as fast as she should since she has no wolf."" I heard Aiden say.At the time? Way of dealing? He didn't just say that, and the rest did not just nod in agreement. How dare they?..."

I started hormones at 36 and, maybe I'm more socially aware than other trans women in that stage, but I was determined not to wear cheap, revealing clothes. 'second puberty' is understandable, but it doesn't excuse dressing badly or in a way that makes her partner uncomfortable or feel unsafe. and I know feeling like her self expression is being curbed can hurt, but it's important for her to learn that there are consequences; if she wants to live as a woman, she has to internalise that she is being scrutinised ALL the time. that's life now. my advice for her is (and I'm happy to DM with her) get Pinterest. find outfits that look classy and restrained, and make a lookbook. become literate about fashion labels and why they're good. I dated a fashion editor in my early 20s and it hugely influenced how I appreciated womens fashion. show her fun, playful labels like Moschino, Valentino, Versace, All Saints. she can wear a maxi skirt and be incredibly sexy! also, she needs to GET TF OFF AMAZON and the like. stop swearing cheap garbage and get on Vinted. wear cotton, wear silk,, wear real leather. my wardrobe is full of designer clothing that I got for a song. also, and this stings but it's true: *every* trans woman is an ambassador for the entire minority, whether she likes it or not. that's how we're treated. when a trans woman goes out in public in badly coordinated,, revealing clothing, it colours all of us. that's just how it is. she has to get real and accept some hard truths. again, happy to chat with her, in case she'll listen more to another trans woman."

Ensina-me a descansar no Teu cuidado e a reconhecer Tua mão em cada detalhe da minha jornada. Que eu nunca me apoie no meu próprio entendimento, mas sim no Teu amor fiel. Em nome de Jesus, amém.

mov_D831B0BCD5D0FAF20C7D4DC3CF73313B,2025-07-15 13:19:53,en,WEB,"  We are kicking off this week in today's Daily Rundown with Chris Versace sharing our roadmap of events that could influence the market and the Portfolio. Chris touches on weekend tariff moves by President Trump and discusses the earnings reports we will be following this week, including the ones from Portfolio holdings Bank of America  () , Morgan Stanley  ()  and American Express  () . He also explains why the June inflation reports, out on Tuesday and Wednesday, could weigh on the market. Transcript CHRIS VERSACE: Hey, everyone, Chris Versace here. It is Monday, July 14, my friends. We are halfway through the month of July. And despite last week's weak finish, that as you know, was spurred on by renewed Trump trade uncertainty, so far the market is in positive territory. But that could change today as the market has to contend with what happened over the weekend. I'm of course, referring to President Trump pressing trade uncertainty even higher, disclosing potential 30% tariffs on the eurozone and Mexico starting August 1 if they can't come to a trade deal with the US. Now, in Friday's Weekly Roundup, you probably noticed that we continued to talk about our concerns about what the new bout of tariffs and trade uncertainty could mean for the upcoming earnings season and corporate guidance. Trump's actions over the weekend only add to that view. Now, as it relates to today, odds are those weekend developments are going to be the primary driver of the market, folks asking questions, trying to figure out what may or may not happen as we get ready for the June quarter earnings season to kick into a higher gear starting later this week. But today, because we don't have any earnings reports, because we don't have any real fresh economic data coming out, it is going to be the market's thinking about this renewed trade uncertainty that is really going to weigh on the market today. Will we be following comments from the White House during the day? Of course, we will. Will we be following comments from the European Union, from Mexico, and others that have received these Trump tariff letters, yes. Again, we think there's going to be kind of a mad scramble to this potential August 1 date, but we're going to have to take it day-by-day following what happens and assessing any new developments that may happen. Maybe there's a trade deal, maybe there's not. Maybe there are some reciprocal tariffs that are announced. Kind of what Brazil was saying that they could do. We'll have to take it step-by-step. But I can share with you this, that when we put today and whatever it brings behind us, we do have a big week of economic data coming that includes two pieces of inflation data that could very well lead the market to once again question the timing of potential Fed rate cuts later this year. Remember, we've already seen the June ISM data and what it showed for inflation both for manufacturing and for services. So while we may not be surprised what the June CPI and PPI reports bring later this week, there may be others out there that aren't paying attention to all the data like we are, and they could be surprised when they see those June, again, core CPI and PPI figures. Now, again, today, not much. But we will be watching for pre-earnings announcements and what they could mean. Now, let's talk about the rest of the week because again, it's going to be busy. Tuesday, Albertsons is going to report coming off of what Kroger had to say about the impact of tariffs on their business and the lowering of their same store sales forecast for the fiscal year. We want to pay attention to what Albertsons has to say, yes, on tariffs, but also too, what are they seeing about consumer spending. Tuesday also has quarterly results from Ericsson. We'll be zeroing in on what they say about digital infrastructure spending. But we also have Citigroup, JP Morgan and Wells Fargo reporting. Now, these are going to set the tone for what we should be hearing from Morgan Stanley and Bank of America on Wednesday. So what will we be paying attention to when Citigroup, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo report? What are they saying about investment banking, particularly their pipeline? And do they give us any specific color on the IPO market, the advisory market, the M&A market? We're expecting that they're going to say that their pipelines are robust. But we'll want to confirm that. We'll also want to hear what they have to say about commercial banking, about consumer spending, credit card debt, and of course, trading volumes. And again, that's going to set the stage for Bank of America and Morgan Stanley. Tuesday, as I mentioned, we also have the June CPI report. And yes, expectations are for it to tick higher. The question will be, is it higher than the market expects? And if it is, that probably won't be viewed very favorably. Wednesday, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, again, talked quite a bit about that. We will be revisiting our price targets. We do expect both to have very upbeat reports. But again, we really want to pay close attention to what they say about their investment banking pipelines. We also have quarterly results on Wednesday from ASML...."

El español Javier Bardem está entre los finalistas en la categoría de Mejor Actor de reparto en una miniserie o tvmovie gracias a 'Monstruos: La historia de Lyle y Erik Menéndez', la segunda entrega de la popular antología de 'true crime' creada por Ryan Murphy para Netflix. Es la primera candidatura a los Emmy del ganador del Oscar por 'No es país para viejos'. Bardem interpreta en la ficción a José Menéndez, el padre de Lyle y Erik. Nacido en Cuba, fue un hombre de negocios rico y poderoso en la industria del entretenimiento que trabajó como ejecutivo de RCA Records y director ejecutivo de Artisan Entertainment Live Entertainment. Presentado como un padre ambicioso y controlador que impone altas expectativas a sus hijos, fue asesinado a manos de sus hijos, que alegaron que lo mataron en defensa propia después de años de abuso sexual, físico y emocional. El español ya había sido nominado al Globo de Oro y al Sindicato de Actores por su trabajo en la antología criminal de Ryan Murphy, cayendo ante los actores de 'Shogun' Tadanobu Asanoa y Hiroyuki Sanada, respectivamente. Bardem se convierte en el tercer intérprete español en ser finalista al Emmy, siguiendo los pasos de Penélope Cruz ('American crime story: El asesinato de Gianni Versace', otra producción de Ryan Murphy), y Antonio Banderas (por partida doble, gracias a 'And starring Pancho Villa as himself' y 'Genius'). Owen Cooper, la joven revelación del fenómeno británico 'Adolescencia', es su mayor rival en el camino al premio más prestigioso de la televisión."

mov_608827EDA4E37094B0F4EFB26018DAA1,2025-07-15 18:24:11,en,WEB,"  Italian cashmere house Loro Piana, famed for its ""quiet luxury "" brand under the LVMH empire, has been placed under court monitoring over alleged labor abuses in its supply chain involving unauthorized Chinese-run factories using illegal and underpaid workers. An investigation revealed that Loro Piana had allegedly subcontracted production to a shell company that further outsourced work to reduce costs. The shell company allegedly issued fake invoices and engaged in exploitative labor practices, Reuters reported, adding that the brand will now undergo court monitoring for one year as a result. The Milan court's ruling on Monday reportedly makes Loro Piana the fifth high-end brand in Italy to face judicial oversight in a widening crackdown on worker exploitation in the fashion industry. Fashion brands including Valentino, Armani, LVMH's second-largest brand Dior and Italian handbag company Alviero Martini were previously placed under administration for similar issues, Reuters added. HERMÈS OVERTAKES LVMH IN MARKET CAP TO BECOME MOST VALUABLE LUXURY COMPANY Without naming Loro Piana directly, Italy's paramilitary Carabinieri police said in a statement Monday that its labor protection unit had executed a ""judicial administration "" order against a company operating in the high-fashion sector. READ ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP ""It was determined that the fashion house outsources the production of clothing items (including cashmere jackets) to a company with no production capacity, which then outsources the production process to another company, which, in turn, outsources production to Chinese factories to reduce costs, "" the Carabinieri Command for the Protection of Labor said in a press release. The agency added that these factories slashed expenses by hiring undocumented workers, often under unsafe and unfair conditions — paying low wages, ignoring safety regulations and violating labor laws on working hours, breaks and time off. THE HERMES BIRKIN BAG ALLURE AND WHY THE PRICE TAG IS SO HIGH Loro Piana said Tuesday in a statement to FOX Business that a supplier subcontracted work without informing the company, breaching legal and contractual obligations. The company said it learned of the issue on May 20 and ""terminated all relations with the concerned supplier in less than 24 hours."" ""Loro Piana acknowledges the notification received from the Court of Milan's Preventive Measure Section today regarding labor practices by undisclosed and unauthorized subcontractors of one of its suppliers, "" the company said. ""Loro Piana firmly condemns any illegal practices and reaffirms its unwavering commitment to upholding human rights and compliance with all applicable regulations throughout its supply chain, "" it added. ""Loro Piana is committed to ensuring that all its suppliers comply with the Maison's highest quality and ethical standards in line with its Code of Conduct. In this perspective, Loro Piana has been constantly reviewing and will continue to strengthen its control and audit activities."" FASHION NOVA SUED FOR COPYING JENNIFER LOPEZ'S ICONIC VERSACE DRESS The investigation into the luxury powerhouse began in May after a Chinese worker reported being physically assaulted by his employer after demanding roughly $11,700 in unpaid wages, according to Reuters. The employer allegedly beat the laborer and caused injuries that required 45 days of treatment. As a result, the Carabinieri police arrested the Chinese workshop owner and closed his factory in the northwestern suburbs of Milan, the outlet said. Carabinieri police found that the workshop produced Loro Piana-branded cashmere jackets and that its laborers were forced to work up to 90 hours a week, seven days a week, for roughly $4 an hour, Reuters reported. Police said the workers also slept in makeshift rooms illegally built inside the factory, the outlet added. Carabinieri police said inspections at several factories in the Milan area ultimately found 21 unidentified Chinese workers, 10 of whom were employed illegally and seven of whom were undocumented immigrants in Italy. Reuters contributed to this report. Original article source: LVMH's luxury label Loro Piana placed under court monitoring over alleged labor abuse, undocumented workers"

Rappers weren't making songs about murders and crimes they were committing outside of selling dope. Xraided was maybe the closest we got to today's level of self snitching and he did 26 years behind that song and album cover he put out. 2pac wasn't snitching because as I remember he was never trying to get them niggas locked up. Whether they had him setup or not he had real smoke with them and put it in his music. ""Now its all about Versace, you copied my style, 5 shots couldn't stop me, I took it and smiled"". That's not snitching. 50 cents ghetto quaran wasn't snitching either he was telling a story of what was going on around him. If he name dropped you in the song you might feel different tho but most of it was already known. The art of story telling is what rap used to be about in the 90s. The hip hop police and the FBI were prevalent in the rap game back then also. Alot of the legends from 90s rap weren't king pins like they're portrayed before the fame. Most were small time hustlers and drug dealers. What we're seeing today is straight up self snitching by niggas who are still in the field."

Cantante, bailarina, actriz, productora, empresaria... y un largo etcétera de etiquetas que incluso se quedan cortas. Mujer orquesta por méritos propios. Desde ser la primera artista en tener un álbum y una película en el número uno la misma semana —con J.Lo y Planes de boda, en 2001—, hasta actuar en el intermedio de la Super Bowl 2020 junto a Shakira —siendo las primeras latinas en compartir ese escenario y utilizándolo para hacer crítica social—, pasando por sus momentos más virales como el videoclip de On The Floor o ser la razón de la creación de Google Imágenes gracias a su aparición con el icónico vestido verde de Versace en los Grammy del 2000. Pero ignorar que hoy camina sobre hielo fino en su carrera es no querer ver el contexto que la ha llevado a embarcarse en su última gira, Up All Night, que culminó con su delicada llegada al Sant Jordi este 15 de julio. Relato de autosuperación y empoderamiento femenino En 2024, Jennifer Lopez parecía tenerlo todo. Había vuelto con su amor eterno, Ben Affleck, y estaba escribiendo, produciendo e interpretando un triple proyecto —disco, película y documental— con un coste de 20 millones de dólares pagados de su propio bolsillo. El objetivo: homenajear, responder o reimaginar su disco This Is Me... Then, veinte años después. Con un tono grandilocuente y un relato de sueño americano, quería mostrar su verdadero yo y cantar “la historia de amor más grande jamás contada”. ¿El resultado? Quizás aquello de: “Aunque puedas hacerlo, no siempre significa que debas hacerlo”. Ella misma admitía en el documental que nadie lo pedía. Y, efectivamente, la recepción fue tibia: el disco tuvo las peores cifras de ventas de su carrera; la película fue criticada por excesiva, confusa y de mal gusto; y la gira, pensada para promocionarlo, inicialmente titulada This Is Me... Now: A Love Story, rebautizada luego como The Greatest Hits para ganar notoriedad, fue cancelada un mes antes de su inicio por falta de entradas vendidas. Por si fuera poco, todo coincidía con la firma de su divorcio con Affleck. Viéndolo así, quizá Jesucristo en la cruz no sufrió tanto como JLo aquel verano. Pero el relato de autosuperación y empoderamiento femenino que acompaña su personaje público la ha llevado de nuevo a la carretera menos de un año después. Up All Night 2025, una gira que repasa todos los himnos de su carrera. Estratégicamente, sin embargo, resulta curiosa: evita las grandes ciudades habituales en giras internacionales y apuesta por lugares donde nunca ha actuado y quizá tiene más posibilidades de llenar. África —con parada única en Egipto—, Europa —con siete fechas en España— y Asia son los territorios elegidos. Así que, en una sofocante tarde de martes veraniega, tocaba subir a Montjuïc para ver si Jenny from the Block sigue tan en forma como dice. Aunque los pases VIP de 1.700 euros estaban agotados, aún quedaban localidades sin vender. Pero eso no supuso ningún problema cuando la del Bronx apareció vestida de general —estilo lentejuelas Ibiza party— al ritmo de On The Floor. Como si fuera misa, se recitaba cada verso con Pitbull. El público, formado por gente que claramente ya salía de fiesta allá por 2011, tenía ganas de marcha. Y JLo lo dio todo. Ella y su cuerpo de bailarines. Desde el EDM de Save Me Tonight hasta el himno feminista Ain't Your Mama: empoderamiento y viaje de la heroína en clave femenina. Con ese español de “soy latina pero claramente me gusta Taco Bell”, se dirigió agradecida a su público tras seis años sin pisar nuestro país. A pesar de una puesta en escena clásica —una pasarela sencilla y pantallas laterales sin grandes efectos—, la acción sobre el escenario fue incesante. El concierto se dividía en bloques, con sus respectivos cambios de vestuario. El segundo tramo fue puro rock: body de cuero con tachuelas, Jenny from the Block, y una versión potente de I'm Real. Con una energía casi agresiva al estilo de las guitarras urbanas de Lil Wayne, Regular sonó como el tema más duro de la escuela de los 2010. Todo, por supuesto, acompañado de fuegos rodeando el escenario. “Yo sigo siendo la misma chica del barrio”, dijo, aunque poco queda ya de esa chica dentro de una millonaria que ha dedicado su vida al espectáculo. Pero de cara a la galería, viaje a 2005: la coreografía entre funky y hip hop de Get Right iba más fuerte que en su videoclip original. Y como la carrera de Jennifer Lopez siempre ha tenido un poco de todo, quiso subir la temperatura con un momento íntimo entre danza contemporánea y Magic Mike, antes de cantar I'm Into You y Moments in Love. También interpretó Birthday, de su próxima mixtape, al más puro estilo Cardi B. Pero el mayor entusiasmo llegó con el R&B de los 2000: Love Don't Cost a Thing, All I Have, y un momento coral junto al público. También hubo espacio para la emoción: cantó Gracias a la vida, de Violeta Parra, y en clave flamenca —con mantón incluido— versionó If You Had My Love. Un poco de corazón roto al estilo Cheetah Girls, con momento bailaora incluido. Pero, ¿quién le dice algo si ya firmaba Ain't It Funny en 2001? Tras el ecuador del concierto, quedó claro que JLo, con casi 56 años, tiene la fuerza, la voz y la presencia escénica que muchas más jóvenes quisieran. Una máquina incansable de baile y desparpajo sobre el escenario. Tal vez no esté constantemente de gira, pero cuando lo hace, lo da todo. Lo que vimos en la Super Bowl hace cinco años no es nada comparado con lo que ofrece cuando el escenario es suyo. Cuesta creer que, solo dos noches antes, hubiera sido abucheada en Fuengirola por un mal sonido. Saliendo de un divorcio y de un discreto fracaso comercial, esta gira es su pequeña catarsis terrenal. Según ella, el amor “es la hostia”, pero también hay que cantar canciones anti-amor: Qué hiciste. Y aferrándose a su faceta latina, interpretó también Si una vez, de Selena...."

Cantant, ballarina, actriu, productora, empresària... i un llarg seguit d'etiquetes que semblen quedar curtes. Dona orquestra per mèrits propis. Des de ser la primera artista a tenir un àlbum i una pel·lícula al número u la mateixa setmana (amb J.Lo i Plans de boda, l'any 2001), fins a actuar a la mitja part de la Superbowl 2020 amb Shakira —sent les primeres llatines a compartir aquest escenari i aprofitant-ho per fer crítica social—, passant pels seus moments més virals, com el videoclip de On The Floor, o ser la raó de la creació de Google Imatges gràcies a la seva icònica aparició amb el vestit Versace verd als Grammy del 2000. Però obviar que actualment camina sobre gel prim és no voler veure el context que l'ha portat a embarcar-se en la seva darrera gira Up All Night, culminant en la seva delicada arribada al Sant Jordi aquest 15 de juliol. Relat d'autosuperació i dona empoderada El 2024, Jennifer Lopez semblava tenir-ho tot. Havia tornat amb el seu amor etern, Ben Affleck, i estava escrivint, produint i interpretant un triple projecte —disc, pel·lícula i documental— amb un cost de 20 milions de dòlars sortits de la seva pròpia butxaca. L'objectiu: homenatjar/respondre/reinterpretar el seu disc This Is Me... Then, vint anys després. Amb un to grandiloqüent i un relat de somni americà, volia mostrar la seva veritable jo i cantar “la història d'amor més gran que s'ha explicat mai”. El resultat? Potser allò de: “Per molt que puguis fer-ho, no vol dir que hagis de fer-ho”. Ella mateixa reconeixia al documental que ningú ho demanava. I, efectivament, la rebuda va ser freda: el disc va obtenir les pitjors xifres de vendes de la seva carrera; la pel·lícula va ser criticada per ser excessiva, poc clara i de mal gust; i la gira, pensada per promocionar el projecte i anomenada inicialment This Is Me... Now: A Love Story, va ser rebatejada com The Greatest Hits i finalment cancel·lada un mes abans del seu inici per la baixa venda d'entrades. Per si no fos prou, tot coincidia amb la signatura del divorci amb Affleck. Potser Jesucrist a la creu no va patir tant com JLo aquell estiu. Però el relat d'autosuperació i de dona empoderada que acompanya el seu personatge públic, l'ha tornat a portar a la carretera menys d'un any després. Up All Night 2025, una gira que repassa tots els himnes de la seva carrera. Estratègicament, però, és curiosa: evita les grans ciutats habituals de les gires internacionals i aposta per llocs on mai ha actuat i potser té més opcions d'omplir. L'Àfrica (amb parada única a Egipte), Europa (amb set dates a Espanya) i Àsia són els territoris escollits. I així, en una asfixiant tarda d'un dimarts d'estiu, tocava pujar a Montjuïc per comprovar si Jenny from the Block seguia tan en forma com diu. Tot i que els passis VIP de 1.700 euros estaven esgotats, encara hi havia localitats sense vendre. Però això no va suposar cap problema quan la del Bronx va aparèixer vestida de general —estil lluentons Ibiza party— al so de On The Floor. Com si fos missa, es recitava cada vers amb Pitbull. El públic, format per gent que segurament ja sortia de festa l'any 2011, tenia ganes de gresca. I JLo ho va donar tot. Ella i el seu cos de ballarins. Des de l'EDM de Save Me Tonight fins a l'himne feminista Ain't Your Mama: empoderament i viatge de l'heroïna en clau femenina. Amb aquell castellà de “sóc latina però m'agrada Taco Bell”, es va dirigir agraïda al seu públic després de sis anys sense visitar el nostre país. Tot i una posada en escena clàssica —passarel·la senzilla i pantalles laterals sense grans artificis—, l'acció sobre l'escenari era incessant. El concert es dividia en blocs, amb els seus corresponents canvis de vestuari. El segon tram era rock: body de cuir amb tatxes, Jenny from the Block, i una versió contundent de I'm Real. Amb una energia que fregava l'agressivitat de les guitarres urbanes de Lil Wayne, Regular sonava com la cançó més dura de l'escola dels 10'. Evidentment, tot envoltat de focs artificials. “Yo sigo siendo la misma chica del barrio”, va dir, tot i que d'aquella noia ja en queda poc dins d'una milionària que ha dedicat la seva vida a l'espectacle. Però, de cara a la galeria, Get Right anava més forta que mai. I com que la carrera de JLo sempre ha tingut una mica de tot, va voler pujar la temperatura amb un moment íntim entre dansa contemporània i Magic Mike, abans de cantar I'm Into You i Moments in Love. També va interpretar Birthday, de la seva propera mixtape, en un estil molt Cardi B. Però l'entrega més gran va arribar amb el R&B dels 2000: Love Don't Cost a Thing, All I Have i un moment coral amb el públic. També hi va haver espai per a l'emoció: va cantar Gracias a la vida de Violeta Parra, i en clau flamenca, amb mantó inclòs, va versionar If You Had My Love. Una mica de cor trencat a l'estil Cheetah Girls, amb moment bailaora inclòs. Però qui li pot dir res, si ja signava Ain't It Funny el 2001? Superat l'equador del concert, queda clar que JLo, amb gairebé 56 anys, té la força, la veu i la presència escènica que moltes més joves voldrien. Una màquina incansable de ball i desimboltura. Potser no gira constantment, però quan ho fa, ho fa amb tot. El que vam veure a la Super Bowl fa cinc anys no és res comparat amb quan l'escenari és tot seu. Costa de creure que, només dues nits abans, hagués estat xiulada per culpa d'un mal so a Fuengirola. Sortint d'un divorci i d'un discret fracàs de vendes, aquesta gira és la seva petita catarsi terrenal. Segons ella, l'amor “és la hostia”, però cal treure també les cançons antiamor: Qué hiciste. I, aferrant-se a la seva vessant llatina, va interpretar Si una vez de Selena...."

His return, without prior announcement, caused an internet frenzy, quickly gaining 7.1 million followers and setting a new record for fastest growth this year. BTS' Jungkook made a thunderous return to Instagram on July 15, 2025, sending the internet into a frenzy. The “Golden Maknae,” who had previously deactivated his account with over 50 million followers in February 2023, returned without fanfare — yet managed to create digital chaos across platforms. Within hours, his follower count skyrocketed, reaching 7.1 million, setting a new record for the fastest-growing Instagram account of the year. The sudden return happened during a spontaneous live session with BTS members V, RM, Jimin, J-Hope, and Jungkook himself. Jungkook revealed that his new Instagram handle, @mnijungkook, is an acronym for “my name is Jungkook,” a name he credited fellow member V (Kim Taehyung) for encouraging him to create. Interestingly, despite not having uploaded a single post or even a profile picture, Jungkook's presence has already left a seismic impact. Story continues below Within 24 hours of his comeback, the hashtag #JungKook crossed a staggering 75 million posts on Instagram, making it the most-used celebrity hashtag on the platform. The hashtag's massive reach placed him just behind Donald Trump, who led with 23 million mentions globally. Jungkook, astonishingly, followed with 20 million mentions, securing his spot as the second most-mentioned personality in the world in the last 24 hours. The ripple effect extended to celebrity circles too. Notable figures like Calvin Klein's Global Celebrity and Talent Director Ryan Petz, Korea Creative Director Ji Hye-Kang, and R&B producer Jay Versace began following Jungkook's new account. BTS members RM, V, Jimin, J-Hope, and Suga also quickly followed him, affirming his return. Jungkook, in turn, is only following seven accounts — the official BTS page and his six fellow bandmates. Fans, lovingly known as ARMY, have flooded the platform with welcome-back messages, memes, and emotional reactions. The fact that Jungkook has managed to spark this level of engagement without a single post is a testament to his unmatched global popularity and influence in the digital age. As anticipation builds around his first post, one thing is certain — Jungkook's Instagram reign is just getting started, and the world is already watching."

mov_537A8400D6A67EC7A0E7F0D2379734A7,2025-07-16 23:32:35,en,WEB,"  Olivia Molly Rogers has broken her silence over the apparent 'feud' with her former 'bestie' and stylist Paul Versace. The pair were once all but attached at the hip as the former Miss Universe Australia, 33, attended events with the fashion guru, holidayed lavishly together, and welcomed him as a guest on her podcast, Tell Me More. Paul, 31, even played matchmaker as he introduced Olivia to her ex Morgan Waterhouse and current boyfriend Hugo Breakey – but it seems the friends' tight bond has come to an end. Olivia took to Instagram on Wednesday to answer a fan's question about the pair's relationship. Responding, Olivia admitted their parting of ways was due to geography. From A-list scandals and red carpet mishaps to exclusive pictures and viral moments, subscribe to the DailyMail's new showbiz newsletter to stay in the loop. 'I get a lot of questions on here whenever I do a Q&A which I do understand because we used to spend a lot of time together,' she wrote. 'So, just to address it gently - he moved to Sydney and we are not working together any more.' Olivia rounded out her post with a hint that there may have been a fractious element to their relationship. 'Sometimes friendships shift, but I will always wish him nothing but the best,' she added. While Olivia and Paul still follow each other on Instagram, the model was last seen on his company account, Styled By Bloom, in September 2024. Paul styled the beauty for the Spring Gala event at Flemington Racecourse in Victoria, but she has not appeared on his styling account since. The friends were typically spotted together at all the major Melbourne events, including Melbourne Fashion Week and the F1 Glamour on the Grid event, as they worked together to craft extravagant looks for the occasions. However, Olivia appears to have hired a new stylist for all her red-carpet appearances so far this year. As for their personal Instagram pages, Paul wiped all traces of Olivia from his personal account last week while he was on holiday in Japan. Meanwhile, Olivia still has pictures of Paul on her page, with the last one being posted in June last year—though she continued to tag his styling account up until September. Speculation has arisen that their bust-up may be linked to Olivia's split from her ex Morgan, as he was also friends with Paul, who first introduced the couple in early 2023. However, this is currently uncertain as Paul also introduced Olivia to her current boyfriend Hugo following her split from Morgan in December 2023 after seven months of dating. Speaking about the bestie bust-up in March, Outspoken podcast hosts Amy, Sophie and Kate Tauber claimed Molly's break-up with Morgan was behind the split. 'When it comes to a break-up, you try and be friends with both parties originally and it gets to a point where that is no longer possible,' they said. They then questioned: 'Perhaps he has picked Morgan over Olivia?' Olivia revealed in July last year the details of how she had a chance meeting with Hugo thanks to Paul, as she participated in a Q&A with fans on Instagram. When one follower asked how the lovebirds met, Olivia responded: 'I love the story of how we met so I'm happy to answer. 'It was out at a bar in Melbourne. My stylist Paul spotted him on the dance floor and went over. 'He said, ""You're handsome, are you single? I have the perfect girl for you."" Then told him to stay there. 'P came and grabbed me, pulled me over and put me in front of him. 'And the way Paul describes it, ""There were love hearts popping in the sky all around you both."" So Paul is the ultimate wingman.'"

1BD6665C18CF7CD3EE1CE57CCDA8C71E,2025-07-17 07:22:00,en,PRINT,"  When Ronald Galotti was running magazines at Condé Nast, he was used to entertaining the likes of Linda Evangelista and Gianni Versace. That was then. Now, the company he keeps is a little different. One recent morning, he and his wife, Lisa Galotti, woke up at their farmhouse in North Pomfret, Vt., to find an unexpected guest fluttering around their fireplace. ''It's a baby hawk,'' Mr. Galotti said to his wife. '' He must have come down the chimney. Get me a towel.'' So she did. At which point, he pulled the bird out of the fireplace, let out a choice expletive as it tried to take a bite of his index finger, and continued with a tour of the property. In the 1990s, Mr. Galotti was arguably the best-known magazine publisher in America, the guy who had helped build up Vanity Fair and Vogue. Granted, that role does not generally bring the same fame as editing those titles can, but it was not as if Graydon Carter had served as the inspiration for Mr. Big, the highflying, limousine-riding, sometime paramour of Carrie Bradshaw in ''Sex and The City.'' Mr. Galotti had. Then, in 2003, Mr. Galotti, at the age of 54, and serving as the publisher of GQ magazine, was fired by his bosses at Condé Nast. In 2004, he announced in New York Magazine that he was moving 270 miles away to a giant plot of land up a dirt road. He was going to fish and hunt and cut down trees and raise chickens and even join the volunteer fire department. His friends, his enemies, New York media watchers of the '90s and 2000s were all certain: There was no way Mr. Big would last up there. But it's been more than 20 years. And he did not come crawling back to civilization or try to rescale the heights of a media empire that has since receded. That empire -- or its heyday at least -- has ignited a curious flurry of interest lately. ''When the Going Was Good,'' Mr. Carter's memoir about (among other things) working as the editor of Vanity Fair, was a recent best seller. '' Empire of the Elite: Inside Condé Nast, the Media Dynasty That Reshaped America,'' by Michael Grynbaum, a New York Times media reporter, comes out later this month. And Anna Wintour recently announced she would give up her role as editor in chief of American Vogue, signifying the end of that particular job title, and an era. It's a moment that seems to affirm Mr. Galotti's retreat. ''I'm not sitting in the chair anymore,'' he said. '' But it seems like the destiny is not good.'' A Jacuzzi in Manhattan, via Peekskill Where magazine editors might pride themselves on being erudite, publishers are a little like gangsters by way of Madison Avenue. A story Mr. Galotti takes great pride in telling involves going to see S.I. Newhouse Jr., the billionaire owner of Condé Nast, sometime in the late '90s or early 2000s. At his apartment near the United Nations, he found a Damien Hirst sculpture containing a cow's head dripping in formaldehyde. ''I said, 'How much did you pay for that?''' Mr. Galotti said, sitting in the living room on the ground floor of his house, wearing what he usually wears these days -- loose Levis and a red flannel shirt with chest pockets. '' He said something like $1.2 million. I said, 'For that price, I could have just taken the client's head and put it in there for you.''' Mr. Galotti was born in the Bronx, which you can still hear in his voice, telling his origin story, even after several decades in Vermont. He grew up in Peekskill, N.Y. His parents ran a liquor store together. When he was 9, his father died of a heart attack. Mr. Galotti recalls being a mediocre student, but he worked hard at a farm, where he tended to the horses and the chickens. During Mr. Galotti's senior year, the principal informed his mother that he had skipped too much school and would not graduate with his class. In Mr. Galotti's memory, an arrangement was worked out by which he would enter the Army. In exchange, he would receive his diploma. It was then the time of the Vietnam War and he went to the Philippines, with the Air Force. During his time in the service, he got married. When he returned to the states, he and his first wife moved to Cocoa Beach, Fla., where he worked as a waiter, and then started a heating and cooling business. After that enterprise went under, Mr. Galotti moved back to New York, where he and his wife lived in her mother's basement. He said his mother became involved with a guy who ran a trade publishing company. Mr. Galotti went to work for him, selling ads in the highly specialized area of sewing goods. In 1970, Mr. Galotti and his first wife had a little boy. He died in a car accident at age 4. Mr. Galotti was at the wheel. The marriage, he later said, was quickly over, and Mr. Galotti plunged further into the work of selling...."

À la fois adorées et critiquées, jugées tour à tour kitsch ou futuristes… les chaussures transparentes signent cet été un retour en grande pompe. Véritable madeleine de Proust pour les amateurs de mode des années 2000 et 2010, elles s'imposent à nouveau comme les it-shoes de la saison, portées avec aplomb par des célébrités comme Hailey Bieber, Alexa Chung ou encore Amal Clooney.

Conçues en vinyle, PVC ou mesh, les chaussures transparentes ne cherchent plus à se faire discrètes : elles revendiquent une esthétique épurée, presque futuriste, et s'imposent comme de véritables accessoires de style. Chez Versace, elles prennent des allures sculpturales avec un talon qui évoque une goutte d'eau en suspension.

So, I went on a rampage buying the highest rated, budget friendly fragrances on Amazon. Unfortunately I do not like any of them except for Sweet Tooth by Sabrina Carpenter. It's a very light, clean scent, but doesn't last. The Bellavita Senorita is a stronger version of Versace Bright Crystal which I already own and don't particularly care for. If you like that scent, then that one is definitely worth buying. The rest of them smell like a substitute teacher from the 90's. Very powdery and overpowering. Also, none are reminiscent of any gourmand scent I've tried. A disappointing hall to say the least. Don't make the same mistake I did.

mov_5A2B4EAC2AF8A5C7A575B0691465F0B8,2025-07-18 09:31:37,en,WEB,"  It was a special evening at Worcester for Jamie Brace and Stephen Allen as the pair combined to win the 2m7f handicap chase with Grillon De Monty. It marked Brace's return to the saddle following a 12-week injury layoff, while 70-year-old trainer Allen was overcoming a long spell between visits to the winner's enclosure. This was just his second victory under rules – remarkably, 31 years after his first in 1994. His last came with Blue Danube, who won the Vale of Evesham Hunters' Chase at Cheltenham in May 1994. The result was an emotional for both. Brace said: “The win brought a tear to Stephen's eye. I promised him after the injury that I'd ride him a winner, and I've done that now. He was absolutely over the moon. “The last winner I gave him was in a point-to-point, so to do it under rules makes it even more special.” He added: “Looking at his form, he ran well when finishing second at Warwick, but hadn't quite followed up on that. It's always great to get a winner – especially for Stephen, who supported me even when I was point-to-pointing.” Brace was injured on April 25, when he was riding High Treason for Nigel Twiston-Davies in a handicap chase and fell. He broke his T9 and L1 vertebrae but has made a remarkable recovery, returning to race riding in just under 13 weeks. Reflecting on his injury and recovery, he said: “From when I did it to when I came back four days later they couldn't understand why I wasn't in pain, even after MRI scans and x-rays. “I've got a 30-degree compression in my spine. There was talk of an operation, but because I had no pain and and was going through the exercises with no effort, I didn't need one.” Now back in the saddle, Brace is looking to build momentum. “I probably came back quicker than I should have. I'm very lucky in that respect,” he added. “You're always a bit nervous getting on that first horse back, especially going straight over fences again. But once you're over the first, everything goes out [of] the window. At the end of the day, it's your job, isn't it? “It doesn't happen very often, coming back from a long injury and bouncing back with a winner like that.” Looking forward, Brace said: “I've got a couple of rides booked – I'm at Stratford on Sunday riding Versace Twentyone for Sheila Lewis, who I've won on before, so hopefully it'll be another nice, straightforward one.” Grillon De Monty joined Allen's yard from Dan Skelton in December 2024 and had been winless in eight starts since then before this breakthrough. The ten-year-old is one of just six horses to run under rules in the last five years for Allen, who is based in Oxfordshire and trains primarily for point-to-point racing.

Es war die Rückkehr von Brace zum Sattel nach einer 12-wöchigen Verletzungsentfernung, während der 70-jährige Trainer Allen einen langen Zauber zwischen den Besuchen des Gewinners des Gewinners überschritt. Dies war nur sein zweiter Sieg nach Regeln – bemerkenswerterweise 31 Jahre nach seinem ersten 1994. Sein letzter kam mit Blue Danube, der im Mai 1994 in Cheltenham das Vale of Evesham Hunters 'Chase gewann. Das Ergebnis war für beide emotional. Brace sagte: „Der Sieg brachte Stephens Auge eine Träne. Ich versprach ihm nach der Verletzung, dass ich ihm einen Gewinner fahre, und das habe ich jetzt getan. Er war absolut überglücklich. “Der letzte Gewinner, den ich ihm gegeben habe, war in einem Punkt zu Punkt, so dass es noch spezieller ist, dies unter Regeln zu tun.” Er fügte hinzu: “Als er sich seine Form ansah, lief er gut, als er in Warwick den zweiten Platz belegte, aber es hatte nicht ganz nachgedacht. Es ist immer großartig, einen Gewinner zu bekommen-besonders für Stephen, der mich auch bei Spitzanzügeln unterstützte.” Brace wurde am 25. April verletzt, als er in einer Handicap-Verfolgungsjagd für Nigel Twiston-Davies mit einem Hochverrat fuhr und fiel. Er brach seinen T9- und L1 -Wirbel, hat sich aber bemerkenswert erholt und kehrte in knapp 13 Wochen zum Rennen zurück. Als er über seine Verletzung und Genesung nachdachte, sagte er: „Von als ich es tat, als ich vier Tage später zurückkam, konnten sie nicht verstehen, warum ich selbst nach MRT-Scans und Röntgenstrahlen keine Schmerzen hatte. “Ich habe eine 30-Grad-Komprimierung in meiner Wirbelsäule. Es wurde von einer Operation gesprochen, aber weil ich keine Schmerzen hatte und die Übungen ohne Anstrengung durchlief, brauchte ich keine.” Jetzt im Sattel will Brace dynamisch aufbauen. “Ich bin wahrscheinlich schneller zurückgekommen als ich sollte. Ich bin sehr glücklich in dieser Hinsicht”, fügte er hinzu. „Du bist immer ein bisschen nervös, wenn du auf das erste Pferd zurückkommst, besonders wieder direkt über Zäune. Aber sobald du die erste bist, geht alles aus [of] das Fenster. Am Ende des Tages ist es dein Job, nicht wahr? “Es kommt nicht sehr oft vor, kommt von einer langen Verletzung zurück und hüpft mit einem solchen Gewinner zurück.” Auf die Zukunft sagte Brace: “Ich habe ein paar Fahrten gebucht – ich bin am Sonntag in Stratford. Fahren Sie mit Versace Twentyone für Sheila Lewis, die ich zuvor gewonnen habe. Hoffentlich wird es eine weitere nette, unkomplizierte.” Grillon de Monty schloss sich im Dezember 2024 Allens Hof von Dan Skelton an und war seitdem in acht Starts vor diesem Durchbruch gewonnen.

But every July like clockwork, I swear off denim trends indefinitely. Not even Lawrence's baggiest of baggy jeans could replace my lightweight lace-trimmed bottoms. Turns out, my denim antidote agrees with the celebrity style calendar. Lace-trimmed skirts and shorts have won over my favorite fashion muses for summer 2025, even Lawrence herself. Why now? ""They're the perfect mix of comfortable and polished for summer: lightweight, breathable, and effortlessly feminine,"" Micaela Erlanger, celebrity stylist to Kelly Clarkson and Lupita Nyong'o, tells me over email. Erlanger credits lace's popularity to the revival of '90s nostalgia. ""It's all about softness, texture, and ease,"" three themes still dominating '90s-esque minimalism today. ""Zoë Kravitz and Jennifer are embracing more fluid, expressive pieces, and lace adds a subtle, elevated touch without trying too hard,"" the expert adds. You may like This slow but steady rise began in the mid-2010s, when lace-trimmed everything was synonymous with Phoebe Philo's Céline era. The designer's Spring/Summer 2016 collection has stood the test of time, echoing in Spring 2025 designs from Versace, The Row, Saint Laurent, and Dries Van Noten. A Spring 2016 Celine collection kicked off a lace-trimmed obsession that's still echoing throughout fashion today. (Image credit: Launchmetrics) A model wore a lace-trimmed skirt on the Dries Van Noten Spring 2025 runway. (Image credit: Launchmetrics) The key here is ""vintage charm."" If your mom would've worn the lace-trim look as an underskirt back in the day, you're on the right track. Lawrence and Kravitz are loyal to skirts, but stars like Bel Powley are giving lacy shorts a go. At Glastonbury, the actor's lace barely peeked out from underneath an oversize band tee, a tomboy-ish duo beloved by fashion girls everywhere. While the trends are similar, Erlanger says shorts versus skirts give off totally different energies. ""Shorts are more playful and cool, with that off-duty, easygoing vibe, while skirts feel romantic and polished."" So, be sure to style accordingly. Wearing a skirt? Erlanger recommends a button-down and strappy heels to ""keep it crisp."" For shorts, follow Powley's lead with a vintage tee and sleek sandals. Ahead, see which celebrities are leading the lace-trimmed charge this summer. If inspiration strikes, shop their styles while you're at it. Get exclusive access to fashion and beauty trends, hot-off-the-press celebrity news, and more. Jennifer Lawrence's Slip Skirts In June, Jennifer traded jeans for a lace-trimmed skirt and a matching tunic. (Image credit: Backgrid) Since J.Law styled a lace-trimmed skirt with a matching tunic in June, I've copied the combo three times (and I'm not done yet). Her vintage graphic tee would look just as chic with shorts, so maybe she'll swap out her skirt soon. To finish, Lawrence's Manolo Blahniks tapped into the toe-ring sandal trend with ease.

She's a walking ad for the brand, so her skirt (unsurprisingly) sold out in minutes. Luckily for me, there are similar styles on the market.

It's a thriller that has high stakes, it's tense and violent at times, but at the same time, there's always this dark humour that underlies it. ""The character moments, the central relationship, and those beats of dark humour and wit are exciting and really attracted me to the project."" Gina Gershon takes on the role of Marie, with Gerald Kyd featuring as Luka. At 63, Gina Gershon is an American actress and songstress celebrated for her roles in Showgirls, Killer Joe, and House of Versace. Gerald Kyd brings his half-Greek, half-Scottish heritage into play as the actor known for portraying Sean Maddox in Casualty. The character Kayla is brought to life by Shalom Brune-Franklin, while Devon Terrell steps into the shoes of Kayla's brother Ezra. Brune-Franklin, a British-Australian talent, has shone in Our Girl, The Tourist, and The State. Australian actor Devon Terrell is recognized for his portrayal of a young Barack Obama in the 2016 biopic Barry. How many episodes make up The Assassin? The series is made up of six episodes, which will all be available to watch at the same time. The series kicks off with the complex history between Julie and Edward, culminating in a finale where Julie faces the fallout from her past actions. Currently, it remains uncertain if the show is a limited series or if a second season is in the cards. Catch The Assassin streaming on Prime Video come July 25."

After all, it's FRIDAY and the sun is just sitting there in the sky, waiting to be worshipped. The Fashion Inspiration for 'The Gilded Age' Wedding Scene Was the Princess Diana of Her Time  Gladys Russell's show-stopping wedding gown was designed by a worldwide team of artisans—and nodded to a real-life heiress. On the fashion front, Gladys's long-sleeved, rosette-covered wedding gown is straight out of a fairytale, making her less-than-happy ending all the more tragic. So, too, was the opulent guest attire, bridesmaid gowns, and historically accurate suiting worn by the rest of the cast. Naturally, Costume designer Kasia Walicka-Maimone, who's worked across the show's three seasons, went fully custom for the big wedding scene. Using “a combination of historical research, paintings, and fashion references” as inspiration, she tapped a global village of makers and artisans to bring the vision to life. “Producing the bridesmaid dresses, wedding guests, and clergy took an extraordinary amount of assistant costume designers, shoppers, costumers, makers, milliners, and fitters,” she explains. Hannah Waddingham has described upcoming Ted Lasso season 4 as a 'beloved dog that was buried'  Apple TV+'s top football comedy series is coming back. “It feels like it was the most beautiful, beloved dog that was buried, and now we've exhumed it, and I am here for it,” Hannah told Variety at the Smurfs premiere in Los Angeles, adding that her character has been in her thoughts for a while. “I was hankering and hankering and hankering and hankering to see where Rebecca had gone, where she was going to. She's my girl. She's in my bloodstream, so I'm thrilled that it's been exhumed.” Bohemian rattan bed frames are sweeping across Instagram   Rattan bed frames aren't exactly new on the interiors scene – if your Pinterest board's anything like ours, it's likely been populated with natural rattan and woven headboards for the best part of a decade – but their hold on our bedrooms is showing zero signs of waning. And in peak sunshine season? The easy, breezy natural texture hits even harder. Lightweight but durable, pretty but practical, these pieces manage to tick every box – in the most laid-back, boujee fashion – and that's before we even get into clever ottoman designs or dreamy French style curves. Hostage is Netflix's female-fronted political thriller that you need to add to your watchlist *now*  Suranne Jones playes the British Prime Minister, whose husband is abducted. Suranne Jones (Gentleman Jack, Doctor Foster) is set to star in and executive produce Hostage, which sees two female politicians forced into both a rivalry and extreme survival situation. Suranne plays the British Prime Minister, whose husband is abducted, and Julie Delpy plays the visiting French president is blackmailed. Will they be able to come together? Netflix's plot synopsis reads as follows: “When the British prime minister's husband is kidnapped and the visiting French president is blackmailed, the two political leaders both face unimaginable choices. Forced into a fierce rivalry where their political futures, and lives, might hang in the balance, can they work together to uncover the plot that threatens them both?” What happened to Amy Bradley? True story behind Netflix series  The mystery of 25 years has gotten the Netflix treatment. Amy Bradley disappeared while on a cruise of the Caribbean with her family in 1998, yet over 25 years later, the case surrounding the 23-year-old still mystifies police. Because a body was never found, many believe that Amy is still alive. In Netflix's latest true crime offering, Amy Bradley Is Missing, we dive headfirst into the unsolved case, hearing from Amy's friends and family along with the officers still trying to solve the mystery of her disappearance and establish whether this was a tragic accident or crime. So what actually happened to Amy Bradley? Bored of Summer Pastels? Molten Chrome Nails Are the Bold Refresh You Need  Glossy, edgy, and summer-proof   Partly because I'm in beauty journalism, and partly because I just love it, I keep on top of current and emerging nail trends. While one of this season's most popular looks is shell nails, AKA seashell-inspired nail art, another trend that's growing in popularity is molten chrome nails. And yes, they are as cool as they sound. Now, if your preferred aesthetic is a milky nail or beige-based nude, à la lip gloss nails or soap nails, this trend may not be for you. This trend is about bold chrome silver and edgier nail art. In a way, it's a kind of anti-summer nail trend. Put aside any ideas of chrome powder nails of the glazed doughnut era and think molten drips, ovals, or anything that showcases melted chrome. Forget Engagement Rings, The Coolest Girls Are Wearing Diamonds on Their Toes  2001 called, it's time the toe ring made a return   I'll whisper this—to avoid any side-eye—but it's time to invest in your feet. And no, I don't just mean treating yourself to a sleek summer pedicure. I'm talking silver, gold, and maybe even a diamond or two if you're ready to fully embrace the most luxurious trend of the moment: the toe ring. Yes, really. And before you dismiss it, allow me to make my case. At first, it started subtly. Burberry sent models down its Spring/Summer 22 runway with toe rings stacked against minimalist sandals. Then Rihanna stepped out in a rumoured £450,000 pear-shaped toe ring ahead of the 2023 Met Gala—cue the “shine bright like a diamond” jokes—and model Carla Bruni wore not one, but three silver toe rings to the 80th Venice Film Festival. A Layered Necklace Set Will Do Your Styling Work For You – Here Are 15 Of The Best  Nail the art of stacking instantly. There's nothing quite like the nonchalance of a layered necklace. When chains and pendants are stacked 'just so', they manage to look both effortless and perfected at the same time. But layering is trickier to master than you might initially imagine… Link length is the most important factor, as necklaces are best showcased when gradated, but textures are also key – each chain needs to be both different and complementary at the same time. And don't even get us started on the art of seamlessly weaving in this season's favourite beads and pearls, too         30 Expert-Approved Wavy Haircuts That Will Enhance Your Natural Texture   Most wavy hair types can be easily straightened, blown-out, curled, or left natural—and their in-between texture also makes them the perfect foundation for virtually any haircut, including pixie cuts, blunt lobs, short bobs, and even mullets...."

""Britney, us millennials all have a story of a moment, or of years, that you made us want to shine and inspire awe, with strength and joy and immensely hard work. Thank you for your example and your contribution to women telling their stories."" Lively spoke to People on the red carpet ahead of the premiere and was sure to dote on Spears and the iconic gown, mentioning that she thinks it should be in The Smithsonian or The Met, and that she feels so grateful to wear it. In addition to paying homage to Spears' style amid the highly-anticipated premiere, Lively also wore her hair similar to how the songstress styled hers as part of the look over two decades ago. This is not the first time that Lively has attempted to recreate one of Spears' legendary looks. The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants standout sported an all-denim fit during a night out with her co-stars in July, coining the fit, ""It's Britney B****.""

n3wdg9i,2025-07-18 22:32:02,en,REDDIT,"  I'll give you a reason to laugh even harder. When my spouse and I were on a cruise in 2023, said spouse scheduled us to dine in the steakhouse restaurant on the first night. When the restaurant's main course was brought out, I stared in horror not at the steak (which was perfection itself), but at the plate upon which the steak rested. I was expecting at least decent commercial-grade restaurant tableware. What I absolutely was NOT expecting was vintage Gianni Versace entree plates, quite possibly Le Jardin pattern. So there I was, Madame I-Aint-Scared-of-Moms-Havilland-Dishes herself, finally faced with a plate I was soul-horrified to actually use. Meanwhile my husband, who is oblivious to anything as valuable as Versace and had no clue about tableware in general, was busily grinding his knife against his own plate and doing his best to stab through it with his fork."

It's a thousands of years old treatment called apitherapy... Man, it's painful."" We've all heard the saying ""beauty is pain,"" and unfortunately, that sentiment has been way too normalized (especially for women). Way too often, putting yourself through discomfort or injury is praised for the sake of beauty standards — especially in Hollywood. Here are 34 times celebrities took ""beauty is pain"" way too seriously: 1. In 2025, Suki Waterhouse tweeted, ""'suki you never tweet anymore' have you ever considered I wore pants so tight 6 months ago it caused a hernia & I've been too scared to tell you."" She also shared a picture of herself wearing said pants onstage (you can see it here). 2. Sofía Vergara's red carpet looks often cause her to bleed. In 2016, she told Net-A-Porter, ""My body has changed with age. People will often say that I wear the same thing on the red carpet, but I know my body: it's very voluptuous, and I've got the boobs of a stripper. They're a 32DDD, and because they're real, they're everywhere, so I need my dresses to have structure — and under armor. There is so much going on under my dresses that I bleed at the end of award ceremonies. In ten years, I think it would be good to have a reduction. I don't think it's even going to be an option not to have surgery, because I'm going to start having back pains. I wouldn't make them too small – just enough that I don't end up looking like an old stripper."" 3. In 2022, Jennifer Coolidge told Allure, ""For The White Lotus, I didn't want to look like a big, white marshmallow on the beach in Hawaii, so I got a spray tan. I got on the plane, and I started to feel really weird. By the time I got off the flight, I had to go to the emergency room. [During the production], I think we ended up using regular makeup. The minute we stopped filming, I would shower."" 4. In 2016, Gwyneth Paltrow told the New York Times, ""Generally, I'm open to anything. I've been stung by bees. It's a thousands of years old treatment called apitherapy. People use it to get rid of inflammation and scarring. It's actually pretty incredible if you research it. But, man, it's painful."" (Note: According to the BBC, researchers say bee sting therapy is ""unsafe and unadvisable."") 5. In 2022, Zac Efron told Men's Health, ""That Baywatch look, I don't know if that's really attainable. There's just too little water in the skin. Like, it's fake; it looks CGI'd. And that required Lasix, powerful diuretics, to achieve. So I don't need to do that. I much prefer to have an extra, you know, 2 to 3 percent body fat."" The process also impacted his mental health. He said, ""I started to develop insomnia, and I fell into a pretty bad depression, for a long time. Something about that experience burned me out. I had a really hard time recentering. Ultimately they chalked it up to taking way too many diuretics for way too long, and it messed something up."" 6. In 2011, Joan Collins wore a Georges Hobeika dress that was so tight, she had to be rushed from the Vanity Fair Oscars Party to the hospital. In an essay for the Daily Mail, she reportedly wrote, ""Next thing I knew, I was surrounded by some rather attractive firefighters who were asking me questions such as: 'What's your name?' (as if they didn't know) and 'How old are you?' (which I refused to answer).

Madeleine and her DJ husband Andrew Fedyk tied the knot in Santorini, Greece, saying I Do at the Cavo Ventus villa, and it's no understatement to say fans have been hanging off every detail. The day before the wedding, Madeleine posted to say she'd be disappearing from feeds until after the nuptials, only building excitement about what was to come. Madeleine White on her wedding day. Pic: Madeleine White / Instagram The outfits As a fashion influencer, expectations for her wedding dress were high, with several followers even making their own prediction videos of clips, saying they were not-so-patiently waiting for the big reveal. When it finally came, in the form of a viral trend that combines the famous Princess Diaries makeover reveal with Taylor Swift's lyrics, Madeleine had jaws on the floor. Madeleine White and Andrew Fedyk on their wedding day. Pic: Madeleine White / Instagram In a made-for-TikTok origin story, she found her dress, a show-stopping gown from Viktor & Rolf's spring 2023 bridal show, on the app and had saved it in 2022, before Andrew had popped the question. 'I reached out to the Viktor & Rolf team to see if I could go to their offices and try on the dress, since it was no longer being stocked in store,' she told Vogue. ' I put it on my body and knew it was my dress.' Madeleine's followers will know she loves anything with butterflies on, and the designer added 40 hand-appliquéd butterflies to the dress to personalise it for her. What a dream! Madeleine's other wedding looks were also divine, with her kicking off the celebrations in an ombré pink Oscar de la Renta spring 2018 dress, which she found on the resale platform Vestiaire Collective.

Natasha Bedingfield took to the stage to play on the night, with a video showing everyone singing along to Unwritten, which in another nod to the online sphere and further cementing the wedding as 'TikTok's royal wedding', recently went viral. Morgan St. Jean, the couple's friend, also performed on the day and sang Madeleine and Andrew's first-dance song, which was Sure Thing by Miguel. Personal touches Madeleine White's bridesmaids on her wedding day.

Madeleine made her bridesmaids' baby blue corset dresses herself, with each dress taking her around 30 hours to complete, after she couldn't track down anything that fit her vision. Dripping the content Madeleine White and Andrew Fedyk during their wedding weekend. Pic: Madeleine White / Instagram For someone who has made a living out of sharing their life online, Madeleine has always been good at putting the camera away, holding something back from viewers, and is known for signing off her videos with the line 'see you tomorrow', a line she's since turned into the name of her sleepwear company. With her wedding content, Madeleine signed off before the big day, and more cynically to allow her Vogue spread to be published, but has been sharing parts of the celebrations ever since. @madeleine_white Honestly one of my fave vids of the day ♬ original sound - Madeleine Fedyk Mixed in with her glossy professional Vogue photos are less polished TikToks taken throughout the day, such as one video showing her bridesmaids and Andrew trying to hype her up just before she walks down the aisle, and another of her and Andrew taking on the viral hand-holding trend to show their 'fits. With a balance of high-glam and relatable wedding moments (even if the budget of these nuptials might be very out of reality for most of us), Madeleine and Andrew have set the bar for influencer weddings!

(as if they didn't know) and 'How old are you?' (which I refused to answer). Apparently, I had fainted in [her husband] Percy's arms, and he, in a panic, had asked security to call an ambulance — which was roomier than [her sister] Jackie's limo and, thanks to the sirens, much swifter in Hollywood traffic.

mov_2CFE2AEDB3802FBBA8E58367B0629A56,2025-07-19 15:21:57,en,WEB,"  If you've opened TikTok recently, chances are you've seen flashes of Madeleine White's seriously swoony wedding that has been a masterclass in influencer events. Madeleine and her DJ husband Andrew Fedyk tied the knot in Santorini, Greece, saying I Do at the Cavo Ventus villa, and it's no understatement to say fans have been hanging off every detail. The day before the wedding, Madeleine posted to say she'd be disappearing from feeds until after the nuptials, only building excitement about what was to come. As a fashion influencer, expectations for her wedding dress were high, with several followers even making their own prediction videos of clips, saying they were not-so-patiently waiting for the big reveal. When it finally came, that combines the famous Princess Diaries makeover reveal with Taylor Swift's lyrics, Madeleine had jaws on the floor. In a made-for-TikTok origin story, she found her dress, a show-stopping gown from Viktor & Rolf's spring 2023 bridal show, on the app and had saved it in 2022, before Andrew had popped the question. 'I reached out to the Viktor & Rolf team to see if I could go to their offices and try on the dress, since it was no longer being stocked in store,' she told Vogue. ' I put it on my body and knew it was my dress.' Madeleine's followers will know she loves anything with butterflies on, and the designer added 40 hand-appliquéd butterflies to the dress to personalise it for her. What a dream! Madeleine's other wedding looks were also divine, with her kicking off the celebrations in an ombré pink Oscar de la Renta spring 2018 dress, which she found on the resale platform Vestiaire Collective. On her wedding day, Madeleine changed into a backless halter gown by Berta for the meal before slipping into a short pink chain-mail dress from Fendi and Versace's Fendace collaboration for the party. This mini was particularly special because it linked back to Madeleine's early days on TikTok, with her telling Vogue: 'Anyone who's been following me for a long time knows that one of my first viral videos ever was trying to DIY the Versace spring 1999 chain-mail dress. 'It felt like fate when, around a year before the wedding, I got a text from a friend in Toronto that Dawn at Rewind Couture had gotten in this one-off Fendi x Versace collab.' It wasn't just Madeleine's designer outfits that made her wedding a masterclass in influencer weddings, as she also arranged a star musical guest to surprise her loved ones. Natasha Bedingfield took to the stage to play on the night, with a video showing everyone singing along to Unwritten, which in another nod to the online sphere and further cementing the wedding as 'TikTok's royal wedding', recently went viral. Morgan St. Jean, the couple's friend, also performed on the day and sang Madeleine and Andrew's first-dance song, which was Sure Thing by Miguel. Perhaps one of the main reasons Madeleine's wedding day has had so many of us is hooked is because of the delicate balance of extravagant luxury (and who doesn't want to oggle at the grandeur on display?!) and sweet personal touches. Madeleine made her bridesmaids' baby blue corset dresses herself, with each dress taking her around 30 hours to complete, after she couldn't track down anything that fit her vision. For someone who has made a living out of sharing their life online, Madeleine has always been good at putting the camera away, holding something back from viewers, and is known for signing off her videos with the line 'see you tomorrow', a line she's since turned into the name of her sleepwear company. With her wedding content, Madeleine signed off before the big day, and more cynically to allow her Vogue spread to be published, but has been sharing parts of the celebrations ever since. Mixed in with her glossy professional Vogue photos are less polished TikToks taken throughout the day, such as one video showing her bridesmaids and Andrew trying to hype her up just before she walks down the aisle, and another of her and Andrew taking on the viral hand-holding trend to show their 'fits. With a balance of high-glam and relatable wedding moments (even if the budget of these nuptials might be very out of reality for most of us), Madeleine and Andrew have set the bar for influencer weddings!"

Екип шивачи на „Долче и Габана“,  облечени в бели работни дрехи с черни, плетени на една кука яки тип „Питър Пан“ и колани с панделки, разгръща воал от тюл и дантела с хирургическа прецизност. Когато крилато насекомо, прелитащо наблизо, се закачва на деликатната материя, настъпва яростно, но приглушено шушукане на италиански, преди крилатата мравка да бъде внимателно отстранена“. Това е част от репортаж, публикуван в списание „Вог“. Действието се развива в имение в околностите на Милано с тухлена вила от 18 век седмици преди сватбата на годината. В главната роля е Лорън Санчес, която вече е мадам Безос.  Тя се появи на корицата на дигиталната версия на Vogue в сватбена рокля на Dolce & Gabbana – тесен корсет, дълги ръкави, италианска дантела, висока яка, ръчни апликации и 180 копчета, покрити с копринен шифон. Моделът, чието изработване е отнело 900 часа, е базиран на сватбената рокля, която София Лорен носи, за да се омъжи за Кари Грант във филма от 1958 г. „Houseboat“.  „Ще се разплача! “, казва бъдещата Безос.  Ден преди това Лорън и Джеф са били в ателието на Dolce & Gabbana в центъра на Милано за последни проби. Младоженецът помолил да види роклята. „Почти се предадох! Но искам да е изненада. Като остарееш малко, не много неща те изненадват. Нямам търпение да видя лицето му“, казва Лорън. И признава, че това е първата й официална рокля, която е толкова затворена на гърдите. Вдъхновена от София Лорен, консултирана от Доменико Долче Тя започнала да я планира още преди година и половина, по време на вечеря в апартамента на Доменико Долче в Ню Йорк с изглед към река Хъдсън. Двойката Безос се запознала с италианските дизайнери няколко лета по-рано, когато яхтите им били  закотвени в Портофино.  „Разглеждах снимки на булки от 50-те години на миналия век. Видях София Лорен - ръцете й бяха в молитвена поза,  тя беше със затворена до шията дантелена рокля. Казах си: „Това е. Това е роклята. “ По време на тридневното сватбено тържество във Венеция, което се проведе от 26 до 28 юни, Санчес смени 27 тоалета. Една от роклите бе с деколте тип „сърце“ и корсет, вдъхновена от филма „ Гилда“ с Рита Хейуърт. За първото вечерно парти сложи коктейлна рокля на Оскар де ла Рента със 175 000 кристала. Сред тоалетите, с които се показа, бяха черна рокля с едно рамо на Alexander McQueen от 2003 г. и класика на Schiaparelli с ръчно бродирани цветя и корсет, покрит със златни мъниста. А за пижаменото парти облече рокля без презрамки от жоржет на Atelier Versace с бродерия от кристална мрежа, която съчета с халат. На фотосесията за Vogue  Санчес показва и рокля с принт на картината на Каналето „Завръщането на Бучинторо на Възнесение Господне“ върху двулицева коприна тип „херцогиня“, украсена с блестящи кристали Swarovski. Друга рокля - драпирана, с дълбоко V-образно деколте от кадифе в цвят бордо и съчетана с колие с диаманти и турмалин, е вдъхновена от мантиите на венецианските дожи по идея на Доменико Долче – дизайнерът е категоричен, че одеждите трябва да са в хармония с мястото, където се провежда събитието.  Това са детайли от бляскавото събитие във Венеция, което цял свят проследи – не само на звездните гости и лукса, но и на протестиращите граждани, които се възмутиха, че милиардерът искал да купи Венеция.   Гръм от ясно небе в модния свят Но в суматохата се случиха две събития, последствията които отекнаха като гръм от ясно небе в света на модата.  Главната редакторка на „Вог“ и Санчес поддържаха някакви отношения, които биха могли да бъдат наречени приятелски, ако не бяха като между змия и лисица, затворени в обща клетка.  ..."

Troy Reese was 12 years old when his adoptive father, William Reese, 45, was shot dead while at work as a cemetery caretaker at Finn's Point National Cemetery in Pennsville Township, New Jersey, by Andrew Cunanan. Troy Reese pictured with his father, William ReeseSWNS William Reese and his wife, Rebecca ReeseSWNS Andrew Cunanan went on a vicious three-month murder spree in 1997, killing five people, including Italian designer tycoon, Gianni VersaceReuters SWNSTroy Reese and his mother, Rebecca Reese[/caption] An uneasy Reese, now 40, recalled his father's eerie warning to his family, where he urged them to be careful after they had watched an episode of America's Most Wanted. William was supposed to pick up his then 12-year-old son from school on May 12, 1997, but when he failed to show up, his wife, Rebecca, picked him up and went to the cemetery where her husband worked. Rebecca, who died at age 52, searched the caretaker's office and noticed the door ajar and the radio playing but did not find her husband. The concerned wife called the police and when officers arrived, they found William dead from a gunshot wound to the head. Investigators said the pistol Cunanan used to kill William was the same one used to murder his second victim, David Madson, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Cunanan is believed to have murdered William for his 1995 red Chevrolet pickup truck, which investigators said he used to drive to Miami where he would kill the Italian fashion mogul, 50, on July 15, 1997. The large-scale manhunt for Cunanan ended on July 23, 1997, when authorities found his remains in a luxury houseboat in Miami. A caretaker called authorities and reported hearing a gunshot. Investigators determined Cunanan fatally shot himself in the head with the same pistol he used to kill three of his victims, including William and Versace. In the years since Cunanan's horrific murder spree, Troy Reese said he feels frustrated that the killer's other victims, including his father, have been forgotten. “The other victims were forgotten except for Versace – nobody remembers the other victims,” Reese, a caterer, from Sicklerville, New Jersey, said. “It makes me feel frustrated, everyone says 'oh Versace' but they forget about me, they forget about the rest of the victims. “I was a kid when my father was killed. Nobody should ever go through that. “Every day has been a struggle for me, I have no parents, no family – I raised myself.” I was a kid when my father was killed. Nobody should ever go through that.

Just days before his murder, Reese said that his father had warned him that Cunanan was on a killing spree and told him to stay safe. “My dad was watching America's Most Wanted, a few days before his murder he warned us that Andrew Cunanan was on a killing spree,” Reese said. “After my dad's death, my mom was so fearful for my safety. “The serial killer had my dad's car with his wallet and keys. She didn't know whether or not he would come to the house after us.” After stealing William's pickup truck, Cunanan drove down to Miami Beach where he shot and killed Gianni Versace on the steps of his Casa Casuarina mansion. The death of the fashion tycoon was featured in the FX docu-series, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story, which explores Versace's death and Cunanan's other victims. Troy Reese recalled he and his mother being irate when they learned Cunanan took his own life. “Once my mom and I heard about Cunanan's death on the houseboat we were angry,” he said. “Angry that we could never go to court and watch him get sentenced. “In my opinion, Andrew Cunanan was a coward, he took the easy way out – he should have paid for his crimes.” Eight years after his father's senseless murder, Reese lost his mom in May 2005 to pancreatic cancer. Reese said that his dad was a “hard-working man” who cared for everyone he knew. “My father was a hard-working man who loved his family,” he said. “My father adopted me, and he gave me something that I never had. He was a true father for the short time that I knew him. “Sadly, eight years after his death, my mom died, having both of them in my life today would be great. “I wanted my dad to watch me grow up, play soccer with me, and become the man he wanted me to be.” AP:Associated PressAndrew Cunanan took his own life in a boathouse in Miami eight days after he killed Versace[/caption] Finally We wish PressBee provided you with enough information of ( ) Also on site"

Sunday, Jul 20, 2025 L'actualité Skip music » NVIDIA atteint une valorisation de 4 trillions de dollars en raison de la demande d'IA. NVIDIA dépasse les références de valorisation du marché, dépassant celles des grandes entreprises technologiques combinées. La société NVIDIA Corporation a atteint une capitalisation boursière historique de 4 trillions de dollars, marquant une étape historique dans le secteur technologique. Cette valorisation positionne NVIDIA comme la société la plus précieuse au monde, dépassant les valeurs boursières combinées de grands géants de la technologie tels que Meta Platforms, Inc. et Alphabet Inc., tout en excédant la capitalisation boursière totale de Microsoft Corporation. De plus, la valorisation de NVIDIA surpasse la somme d'Apple Inc. et d'Amazon.com, Inc. L'augmentation substantielle de la valeur boursière de NVIDIA a été largement attribuée à la demande croissante pour les technologies d'intelligence artificielle (IA). Les unités de traitement graphique (GPU) de l'entreprise sont cruciales pour les applications d'IA, alimentant la croissance dans plusieurs secteurs, y compris l'informatique en cloud et l'analyse de données. Au cours des derniers mois, NVIDIA a rapporté une croissance significative des revenus tirée de ses produits liés à l'IA, y compris les populaires GPU A100 et H100. Ces produits sont très demandés alors que les entreprises et développeurs investissent dans les capacités d'IA, entraînant une expansion de la clientèle de NVIDIA. Selon des analyses financières, la valorisation de NVIDIA indique son potentiel à réaliser des acquisitions substantielles, suscitant des discussions sur sa capacité à acheter d'autres entreprises dans divers secteurs. Par exemple, sa valorisation boursière pourrait lui permettre d'acquérir des entreprises de premier plan telles que Netflix, McDonald's ou Coca-Cola, tout en conservant suffisamment de capital pour d'autres investissements, y compris des projets de divertissement tels qu'un parc à thème. Dans un contexte plus large de technologie et d'investissement, la valorisation sans précédent de NVIDIA reflète l'importance croissante de l'IA dans l'économie mondiale.

Hey, “let's see how far we can go”! An adult does not go to the airport dress like that. PERIOD!!! Where there is smoke there's fire. Sister was detained for disorderly conduct. Why is this even a story clearly it's obvious what happened. They're probably created a scene and made everything worse for people traveling. This is so dumb. You don't go to the airport and a spandex pair of shorts that don't fit you in a tank top that doesn't fit you in a fake Versace robe and expect to get on a plane, especially when your sister is having a fit. Doesn't make any sense. Happy weekend people. ❤️🫶🏼🇺🇸❤"
