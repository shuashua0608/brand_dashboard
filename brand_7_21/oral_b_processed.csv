mov_BD5D44DBCF2516F7B593EC98232E8DC6,2025-07-14 10:29:38,en,WEB,"  The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has, by an order dated July 08, 2025, imposed a monetary penalty of ? 2.70 lakh (Rupees Two Lakh Seventy Thousand only) on Shriram Finance Limited (the company) for non-compliance with certain provisions of the 'Reserve Bank of India (Digital Lending) Directions, 2025' issued by RBI. This penalty has been imposed in exercise of powers conferred on RBI under clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 58G read with clause (aa) of sub-section (5) of Section 58B of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934. The statutory inspection of the company was conducted by RBI with reference to its financial position as on March 31, 2024. Based on supervisory findings of non-compliance with RBI directions and related correspondence in that regard, a notice was issued to the company advising it to show cause as to why penalty should not be imposed on it for its failure to comply with the said directions. After considering the company's reply to the notice, additional submissions made by it and oral submissions made during the personal hearing, RBI found, inter alia, that the following charge against the company was sustained, warranting imposition of monetary penalty: The company routed the loan repayments through the account of a third-party, instead of the borrowers directly crediting the loan repayments to the company's account. This action is based on deficiencies in regulatory compliance and is not intended to pronounce upon the validity of any transaction or agreement entered into by the company with its customers. Further, imposition of this monetary penalty is without prejudice to any other action that may be initiated by RBI against the company.

1lztelo,2025-07-14 17:54:35,en,REDDIT,"  I'm posting this because -- despite all my ""birth plan"" preparation -- I was not mentally prepared for an unplanned C-section after a failed induction. Now, 6.5 months out from the birth and with a healthy baby (and I'm doing great, too!) , I wanted to share this for others so they may learn from my experience. I compiled this from my notes of the birth and my physician's medical notes on the patient portal. I want folks to know about potential side effects of induction medication -- not to scare you but for you to be informed -- as well as C-section sterilization medication allergies. I never knew some of these things were even (rare) possibilities. **If we have a second, with this knowledge, my doctor says I am not a candidate for VBAC. ** I hope this is helpful! (36 year old FTM) **Born Dec. 24, 2024 at 3:52 a.m.** **Weight:** 6 lbs 15.1 oz (3150 g) – 33rd percentile **Length:** 20 in – 50th percentile **Head circumference:** 36.5 cm – 89th percentile **APGAR scores:** 8 and 9 at 1 and 5 minutes **No circumcision performed** I was admitted to Labor & Delivery on the evening of **Sunday, Dec. 22, 2024**, at **39 weeks and 2 days gestation**, for an elective induction. Before heading to the hospital, we had **Shake Shack. ** My pregnancy was medically uncomplicated but included **advanced maternal age (ancient at 36 haha)**, **history of migraines**, **GERD**, **equivocal rubella immunity**, **PKU carrier status** (partner negative). I tested negative for Group B Strep. Labor induction began with oral **cytotec (misoprostol) every three hours**. Despite multiple doses, my cervix remained slow to respond. On the morning of Dec. 23, I was only 2 cm dilated. We tried a catheter balloon to speed things up but it didn't really help. The first **attempt to break my water** was unsuccessful and very painful -- it was unclear if it had been ruptured since baby was plugging up the exit. :-/ Shortly after, I began experiencing **intense, nearly continuous contractions — later identified as uterine tachysystole, an uncommon side effect of cytotec. We went from zero contractions to these fast, unproductive contractions in a matter of minutes. I tried bouncing on a ball and using a labor comb, but it was sudden fast lightning up my rear-end and shot up my spine and then around my stomach (this may be what some people call ""back labor?"") . My husband offered do affirmations with me, to which I responded, ""F*** the affirmations!"" ** **There was no easing into labor pains or ""ramping up over hours"" as I had been told in my birth classes. Uterine tachysystole is rare and can cause uterine rupture. I had not prepared for such sudden pain or once-a-minute contractions right at the beginning. My doctor later said I had an ""over-achieving uterus,"" which I found pretty funny given my Type A personality (after the fact, of course). ** I requested an **epidural around noon, about half an hour after these once-a-minute contractions started**. It took **two attempts**, and during placement I had to stay still through strong contractions. I found breathing like you do when snorkeling an effective way to manage the pain of the placement while having intense contractions. Unfortunately the initial placement left a **""window"" of pain in my lower right quadrant**, which required additional medication and boluses to manage. My baby's heart rate briefly decelerated during the procedure but recovered once I was able to lie back and be adjusted by the nurse. Despite painful and frequent contractions earlier, they slowed down and became steady. But I didn't progress beyond 5 cm for many hours. I was able to rest intermittently. That afternoon, a **second attempt to rupture my membranes was successful**, though only a small amount of fluid was released. Initially, it looked like there might be meconium in the fluid, but it was later determined that there was **no meconium**—likely just dried blood from the earlier attempt. At **4:30 p.m.**, I was still **5 cm dilated and 60% effaced**. Pitocin was started very slowly that evening to try to augment labor, but my baby had **repeated heart decelerations even with just a little pitocin**, and my cervix continued to stall. I had now been at 5 cm for over **12 hours**, and with the added concern of my baby's **large head size (36.5 cm, 89th percentile)** not fitting well in my pelvis, the idea of a cesarean was re-introduced...."

Combined with Invisalign First™ aligners, Invisalign Palatal Expanders provide doctors with a full early intervention treatment solution, including both skeletal (orthopedic) and dental (orthodontic) arch expansion. MUMBAI, India, July 15, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Align Technology, Inc. (""Align"") (Nasdaq: ALGN) a leading global medical device company that designs, manufactures, and sells the Invisalign® System of clear aligners, iTero™ intraoral scanners, and exocad™ CAD/CAM software for digital orthodontics and restorative dentistry, today announced that Align's Invisalign Palatal Expander System has been approved as a Class B medical device by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) and is now commercially available in India for broad patient applicability, including growing children, teens and adults (with surgery or other techniques). The Invisalign Palatal Expander System is a modern and innovative direct 3D printed device based on proprietary and patented technology. Invisalign Palatal Expanders are intended for use in rapid expansion and subsequent holding of skeletal and/or dental narrow maxilla (upper jaw) with primary, mixed, or permanent dentition during treatment of patients. ""The Invisalign Palatal Expander System exemplifies our commitment to advancing digital orthodontics with innovative solutions that enhance patient treatment experiences,"" said David Carr, Align Technology executive vice president and managing director, Asia Pacific. ""We are excited to extend the availability of the transformative Invisalign Palatal Expander system, Align's first direct 3D printed orthodontic appliance, to even more doctors and their patients markets across the Asia Pacific region."" The Invisalign Palatal Expander System consists of a series of removable devices staged in small increments of movement to expand a patient's narrow maxilla to a position determined by their treating doctor. Each direct 3D printed device is customized to the patient's unique anatomy based on an iTero™ intraoral digital scan. A palatal expansion treatment plan and device design are then developed using Align's proprietary AI-driven orthodontic software. Combined with Invisalign First™ aligners, Invisalign Palatal Expanders provide doctors with a full early intervention treatment solution for Phase 1 treatment, an early interceptive orthodontic treatment for young patients. Phase 1 treatment is traditionally done through arch expanders or partial metal braces, before all permanent teeth have erupted – typically at ages 6 through 10. Invisalign First clear aligners are designed specifically to address a broad range of younger patients' malocclusions, including shorter clinical crowns, management of erupting dentition, and predictable dental arch expansion. ""Phase 1 or early interceptive treatment accounts for 20 percent of orthodontic case starts each year and is growing,"" said Dr. Mitra Derakhshan, Align Technology executive vice president, chief clinical officer, global treatment planning and clinical services. ""Together with Invisalign First aligners, Invisalign Palatal Expanders provide doctors with a solution set to treat the most common skeletal and dental malocclusions in growing children. The addition of mandibular advancement features to Invisalign aligners also provides doctors with more options for treating skeletal and dental jaw imbalances and bite correction for their growing patients during their teenage years.""

176D7799EB71D5F35BA2BC11C8577D6F,2025-07-15 07:19:02,en,PRINT,"  Some 140 miles above France, American astronauts opened a spacecraft hatch and found themselves face to face with cosmonauts from the Soviet Union. ''Glad to see you,'' Col. Alexei Leonov spoke in accented English to Brig. Gen. Thomas Stafford of NASA. ''Ah, hello, very glad to see you,'' General Stafford responded in his own accented Russian. The two men then shook hands. Today, Russian and American astronauts routinely share rides to the International Space Station, no matter the geopolitical conflict that divides their nations. But in the summer of 1975, seeing two men from rival nations greet each other in orbit across a bridge between their docked spacecraft was a powerful and unprecedented gesture witnessed by millions on the world spinning below. The handshake, which occurred 50 years ago this July 17, defined the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first international human spaceflight. That simple symbol of partnership between bitter competitors remains an enduring legacy of the mission. ''It's amazing to think that two diametrically opposed countries with different systems and cultures, essentially ready to destroy each other, can somehow cooperate and do this highly technical, complicated mission,'' said Asif Siddiqi, a professor of history at Fordham University and an expert on Russian space history. A generation after the orbital handclasp, the Soviets and the United States would come together to build the I.S.S. The aging space outpost's days are finite, and there are no immediate plans for Russia and the U.S. to sustain their cooperation in human spaceflight. The U.S. also sees itself as competing with China for dominance in space. But experts like Dr. Siddiqi see reasons for hope on the 50th anniversary of the Apollo-Soyuz mission. ''Whenever people tell me that this would never happen today, I always think, Well, that's what people said in the late '60s,'' Dr. Siddiqi said. 'Androgynous' Dock Early in the space age, as America raced to catch up to the Soviet Union, a partnership in space had been proposed. In September 1963, speaking before the United Nations General Assembly two months before his assassination, President John F. Kennedy floated a joint mission to the moon. ''Why therefore should man's first flight to the moon be a matter of national competition?'' he asked. '' Surely we should explore whether the scientists and astronauts of our two countries -- indeed of all the world -- cannot work together in the conquest of space.'' This dream was deferred, and the U.S. would overtake the Soviets in the moon race with the successful Apollo 11 mission in 1969. Oddly, the American moon landing may have created a new window for cooperation. Public support for the Apollo missions fell, and the program was cut short after the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. That left the U.S. space program without an immediate objective In parallel, both nations' reputations were tarnished abroad, the Soviet Union by its invasion of Czechoslovakia, and America by its involvement in the Vietnam War. That created an additional motivation to jointly reassert each country's status atop the global hierarchy. ''They needed to lift themselves up and cooperate with each other to show the rest of the world: We are as super and as great as ever before. We're doing things which no country can do in a similar capacity,'' said Olga Krasnyak, an associate professor of international relations at the National Research University Higher School of Economics in Moscow. This mutually recognized opportunity for prestige led to tentative talks between the country's officials in 1970. From the get-go, it was clear that the mission faced immense diplomatic, technical and cultural obstacles. There was no smooth glide path to launch. ''How do we communicate with people who speak entirely different languages, and who think differently about engineering and problem-solving?'' Brian C. Odom, NASA's chief historian, said. '' On paper, it seems easy. You launch, we launch, we come together, we shake hands, we go our separate ways. But making that happen, where you don't have five people dying in orbit, is incredibly difficult.'' The sudden switch from enemies to partners, at least in this limited case, caused whiplash for the public and politicians alike (a scenario that was dramatized in the Apple TV alternative history series ''For All Mankind''). Zbigniew Brzezinski, who later served as Jimmy Carter's national security adviser, criticized the Nixon and Ford administrations for the mission, calling it a ''technological giveaway.'' Soviet space officials, who long worked in secrecy, had to overcome wariness about loosening the flow of information to an adversary. The country's diplomats had to ensure that plans could be discussed without divulging anything sensitive to national security. Both sides were suspicious of the safety of the other's flagship spacecraft. The three astronauts selected for Apollo 1 perished in a fire during a rehearsal in 1967, while the three cosmonauts of Soyuz 11 died in space in 1971 when their cabin depressurized. Snipes about the superiority of one side's spacecraft over the other rankled insiders of the mission. American astronauts were used to a much more hands-on guidance system with Apollo, whereas Soyuz was largely automatic and controlled from the ground. The vehicles even used different atmospheres in their interiors. Soyuz simulates the familiar conditions of Earth, with a nitrogen-oxygen air mixture and a pressure equivalent to our planet at sea level. Apollo, in contrast, used a pure oxygen atmosphere at a much lower pressure. This discrepancy was solved by the development of a docking module with airtight hatches at each end. Once the module connected the two craft, crew members from one vehicle could enter, ensuring that both hatches were closed while it pressurized to match conditions of the other side. When that process was complete, the hatch to the other vehicle could be opened, allowing crews to safely enter without risking ''the bends,'' a condition caused by rapid depressurization...."

n39lnyr,2025-07-15 14:25:00,en,REDDIT,"  I'm familiar with the counterarguments and they usually boil down to. ""You're reading it too literally."" ""The science was ahead of its time."" ""There are no contradictions in the Qur'an."" If you have specific counterpoints, I can respond. For now below are some arguments I've run into. I'm also adding Jesus' crucifixion and death which is attested by various historical scholars which the Quran claims did not happen 600 years later. 1. Muslim rebuttal usually “The Torah and Gospel were corrupted but the Qur'an only affirms the original revelations.” My thoughts: Not what Quran says, it explicitly tells Christians and Jews to judge by their scriptures (5:47, 5:68). If they were corrupted, why would Allah command people to follow them without warning of falsification? Also, there's zero manuscript evidence that the Bible was changed globally before Islam. We have Torah and Gospel texts from hundreds of years earlier and they match what we have today. Either the Qur'an is affirming real scriptures and contradicting them, or it's affirming corrupted ones... both are a problem. 2. Scientific Errors A. Embryology Muslim now say “It's metaphorical. It's not meant to be literal biology.” My response: That's not how early Muslim scholars read it because tafsirs like Ibn Kathir and Al-Jalalayn took it literally: clot then lump then bones then flesh. Modern embryology shows bones and muscle form together, not in sequence. The Qur'anic version matches Galen's 2nd-century theory, not actual development. If it's metaphor, it's an inaccurate one but why claim it's a miracle of science if it's just metaphor anyway? B. Semen Origin Muslim rebuttal: “It just refers to the general region of the body or it's just poetic.” My response: The verse (86:6–7) unfortunately literally says semen comes from between the backbone and the ribs. That's anatomically incorrect. We know sperm comes from the testicles. There's no way to stretch the Arabic to make that biologically accurate. Again, early Muslims didn't call it metaphor 3. Historical Error – Haman in Egypt Muslim rebuttal: “It's a different Haman, not the one from the Book of Esther.” My response: There's no evidence for this second Haman in Egypt. The Qur'an describes him as a minister to Pharaoh, building a tower just like in the Tower of Babel story, not Egyptian history. It looks like Muhammad (or his sources) confused biblical figures (again) placing a Persian character 1,000 years earlier into Egypt. 4. Borrowed Stories Muslim rebuttal: “Those were true oral traditions. The Bible just left them out.” My response: But we know where the Qur'an got them from, apocryphal and legendary sources. Jesus speaking as an infant? Found in the Arabic Infancy Gospel, written in the 6th century, long after Christ. The Seven Sleepers wqs Christian legend from the 5th century. Dhul-Qarnayn obviously Mirrors Alexander the Great myths from the Alexander Romance stories...."

1m0nkos,2025-07-15 17:11:40,en,REDDIT,"  Under Dogra rule in Jammu and Kashmir from 1846 to 1947, the Muslim majority endured ritual and familial oppression through a matrix of exploitative fiscal policies. Among the most invasive of these was Zar-e-Nikah, a specific tax levied on Muslim marriages. This was not merely a matter of economic extortion; it symbolized the Dogra state's deliberate intrusion into the personal lives of Kashmiri Muslims. The tax served as a reminder that even the most sacred rituals of Muslim life could be regulated and monetized by the state. Folk memory in Kashmir continues to retain this burden. An oral couplet laments the anxiety that engulfed families during those years: Zamanas manz Musliman Keriyeli yenvol. Seryse! Veryyes Pareshan os asan gobre mol. Kiste Kiste; os horan Zalimas cheti dayar. Os der shedi Muqarar her akis tefsilwar. (Translation: During those times, if a Muslim wanted to get married, the parents of the groom would remain under immense stress throughout the year. They were forced to repay debts in recurring installments to moneylenders. A marriage tax was imposed, and without paying it, no marriage could be solemnized.) Sir Walter Lawrence, appointed as the Settlement Commissioner of Kashmir in 1889, famously remarked, “except air and water, everything in Kashmir that was tangible was liable to tax.” That sentiment was not rhetorical. John B. Ireland, an American who visited Kashmir in 1859, documented that on the birth of every lamb, the owner had to pay one anna, and four annas for every calf. Fishing boats were taxed at four annas a day. Even walnut trees were taxed—ten annas annually for the oil they yielded, and if the crop failed, ghee had to be substituted. Ireland also noted that prostitutes were required to pay a share of their income to the state treasury. Such exhaustive taxation created a suffocating environment, and Zar-e-Nikah fit seamlessly into this regime. Documents from the period explicitly list Zar-e-Nikah as a government-imposed levy. One such compendium titled “Nature of Dogra State” catalogues various taxes and includes an entry stating: “Zar‑e‑Nikah: Tax in marriage. Rs 3 had to be paid as tax for the first marriage and Rs 100 in case of second or third marriage.” The imposition of Zar-e-Nikah was part of a wider fiscal matrix that extended deeply into the lives of women and the marginalized. British records reveal that 15 to 25 percent of the Dogra state's revenue came from taxes on women, including Hanji fisherwomen and those working in prostitution, whose labor was monetized and categorized. Brothels were classified into three tax brackets, ranging from ₹10 to ₹40 per annum. Even child trafficking was legalized, with young girls sold under formal stamp-paper agreements, often under the guise of marriage. Arthur Brinkman, author of Wrongs in Kashmir, wrote that these girls became “slaves for life,” and the state reclaimed their wealth upon death. Within this cruel framework, the Zar-e-Nikah marriage tax stands out not just for its religious discrimination but also as part of a broader, gendered system of monetizing the intimate spaces of Kashmiri life. The tiered structure penalized remarriage disproportionately, reflecting the moral and economic gatekeeping inherent in the tax. According to Dr. Showkat Ahmad Naik in his research paper Kashmir Economy Under The Dogras, “On the marriage, a fee of three rupees was to be paid as tax. Even the butchers, bakers, carpenters, fishermen and coolies who were engaged to carry loads for travelers had to give up half of earnings as tax to the state.” The collection of this tax was institutionalized. During Maharaja Gulab Singh's reign, Zar-e-Nikah was implemented at a standard rate of three rupees per marriage, to be deposited into the state treasury. Kashmiri Pandits were explicitly exempted. The right to collect the tax was auctioned annually, generating an income of around 5,000 rupees per year for the Dogra state. These figures are corroborated by multiple historical sources, including the academic paper “Emergence of Political Consciousness in Kashmir during the Dogra Period (1846–1947)” which states: “The Muslims had not only to pay Mandri and Ashgal but they had to pay marriage tax as Sathrashahi also.” The same paper affirms that Hindus were exempt. Further archival documentation comes from Dr. Ashraf Wani, a community historian who references entries from the Shatrashahi office in Batamaloo, Srinagar. One such record names Molvi Nasir ud-Din as an official tax collector. A receipt dated 15 February 1854 documents the collection of 42,000 rupees from 1846 to 1852, relating to marriages, divorces, and related matters. Wani estimates that under Maharaja Ranbir Singh, annual revenues from such collections may have reached nearly 100,000 rupees, a staggering amount in a region where most families lived in poverty. Zar-e-Nikah was not just a line in an official ledger. It altered how Kashmiri Muslims experienced one of the most sacred rites of passage. Oral testimonies describe families postponing or even canceling marriages due to their inability to pay the tax. In some cases, Nikah ceremonies were secretly held in mosques to avoid detection. Officiating maulvis faced punishment or fines if discovered. These practices gave rise to a climate of anxiety, where the simple act of solemnizing a marriage could become a punishable offence. A story passed down orally recounts a Dogra officer named Mehan Singh, who was tasked with raiding mosques to prevent tax evasion during marriages...."
1m0r2g4,2025-07-15 19:21:47,en,REDDIT,"  I experienced SSHL about eight weeks ago. I woke up feeling slightly dizzy (without vertigo) and thought I was coming down with a cold. As the day progressed, I noticed a strange whirring and ringing, along with a sudden decline in hearing in my left ear—likely due to a virus. I routinely have wax build-ups in my ears that block my hearing and cause ringing. Although this felt different, I was hopeful it was just another one of those [cases.As](http://cases.As) a professional musician who makes music for a living, I didn't hesitate to schedule a visit with an ENT the next morning. At that appointment, I was diagnosed with SSHL. My loss was mild-to-moderate up to 6k and moderately severe from 6k–8k. I also had noticeable tinnitus and diplacusis (which is terrifying for a musician). I immediately began a two-week course of oral prednisone (60mg), with a taper starting around day 10. I didn't notice much change in the first few days, but my follow-up five days later showed small gains across the board. A subsequent follow-up at two weeks showed significant improvement, with deltas between 10–20 dB between my ears. One month later (six weeks after onset), audiometry showed total recovery up to 4 kHz, with small deltas remaining (4 kHz: 15 dB, 6 kHz: 5 dB, 8 kHz: 10 dB). I now believe these deltas to be even smaller. My hearing now seems, for the most part, normal. Stereo listening sounds pretty balanced, and I only notice the asymmetry when isolating my ears. The diplacusis has mostly gone away; my left ear is a few cents flat in the lower frequencies, but I only notice it when isolating. My brain compensates for this when listening in stereo, making it a non-issue in practice. I've been taking at-home tests using various apps and have noticed that healing is not linear from day to day—some days test higher than others—but I've observed an overall upward trend. In these tests, I focus less on dB values and more on the deltas between my ears. One thing I want to share is that mental health and relaxation have been critical to my healing. My worrying made both my hearing and tinnitus feel worse. It's essential to try to trust that your body will heal (I know this is easier said than done). I'm still noticing improvements on my home tests and remain optimistic about a full recovery. The main thing I continue to struggle with is tinnitus in the 4–6 kHz range. I'm hopeful it will resolve, given how small the deltas are and that my hearing is now within a normal range across the board. I also ran home tests up to 18kHz and saw no significant deltas. In addition to prednisone, I've been taking NAC, magnesium, ginkgo biloba, vitamin D, calcium, vitamin E, vitamin B, vitamin C, CoQ10, fish oil with omega-3 fatty acids, and a multivitamin. I've also been using Flonase and Afrin. Additionally, I've eliminated coffee, alcohol, refined sugars, and frozen foods, instead focusing on healthy, antioxidant-rich foods. I'm also doing acupuncture, which has been very helpful in managing anxiety. Eight weeks ago, I thought my life was over. I was terrified I'd have to give up the profession I've trained for over 20 years. I had just won my dream job and moved to start in August. Every night, I would wonder if the whole experience was just some surreal nightmare. But through it all, I began to realize that no matter what, things would be okay. I've met some truly incredible musicians with similar stories—some who maintain wonderful careers using technologies like Widex hearing aids, and others who don't need aids and have learned to adjust to their new normal. I've also come to see how important it is to slow down, give your body time to rest, and tend to what needs attention in both mind and body. Please know you are not alone. No matter what, you *will* get through this and be okay. I write this still feeling afraid that I might have to live with this ringing in my ears for the rest of my life, but I truly believe these words. I hope this story offers hope to anyone who is struggling."

The MoU aims to preserve and revive the traditional instruments of Sufiana Mausiqi, a centuries-old classical tradition central to Kashmir's cultural identity. The event was attended by musicians, students, academicians, cultural workers, and local community members. Speaking on the occasion, MLA Bijbehara Dr Bashir Ahmad Veeri, emphasized the need for global cultural exchange to safeguard and evolve indigenous traditions. ""We, as Kashmiris, need to open up to the world and get away from the notion that only we are the best,"" he said. ""The world is opening up, and so should we. Cultural exchange is essential if we are serious about preserving our Sufiana heritage."" B M Sharma, Principal Secretary, Department of Culture, praised the initiative as timely and important, commending the efforts to preserve Kashmir's unique spiritual and musical traditions. Read AlsoKashmiri Teen Awarded Rashtriya Bal PuraskarWorkshop On Sufiyana Music Concludes At Chadoora""Kashmir has a profound and rich Sufi history that must be cherished and passed on to future generations,"" Sharma said. ""This initiative to preserve the instruments of Sufiana Mausiqi is highly praiseworthy and reflects a sincere commitment to cultural preservation."" The project will create a design archive of rare and endangered musical instruments, explore their cultural and historical contexts, and offer training platforms for students and craftsmen. As part of the collaboration, a two-way knowledge exchange will take place: Kashmiri artisans will travel to Anant University to teach students, while students will immerse themselves in fieldwork in Kashmir, engaging directly with master craftsmen and musicians. Prominent social activist Dr Raja Muzaffar Bhat urged the government to extend institutional support to such efforts. ""This is a great initiative taken by Anant National University, and the J&K government must carry this forward on a larger scale,"" said Dr Bhat. Dr Sukamal Deb, Head of ACDC, noted that the initiative is aligned with ACDC's mission to revive India's endangered crafts by promoting preservation through documentation, archiving, and community collaboration. Anant University's Provost, Dr Sanjeev Vidyarthi, underscored the value of introducing students to India's deep-rooted cultural knowledge systems. ""Preserving a traditional art form is not just about archiving artefacts,"" he said. ""It is about carrying forward centuries-old legacies by introducing them to the young minds who will shape our tomorrow."" The collaboration will include field research, oral history documentation, instrument-making workshops, and academic exchange programs. Tulkul Arts, known for its grassroots work in cultural revival through performance and storytelling, will lead community engagement activities to ensure artisans' voices remain central. The project represents a unique fusion of academic design innovation and indigenous knowledge preservation, rooted in respect for tradition and driven by sustainable development goals.

n3h2ih8,2025-07-16 17:00:12,en,REDDIT,"  So I'll make it 100% clear. I am so bad at brushing my teeth but finally got my shit together after a few years of denial and forgetting. First of all. It all began with me trying to get my shit together because. Well, fuck me, but painful teeth is hell first of all even though I can somewhat tolerate it. But I also had a patient at the hospital go from healthy and fine to months in a coma and waking up with permanent brain damage due to an untreated teeth abscess. This shit scared me really. He now needs a walker and this is like the least of his worries. This could have happened to anyone :/ some people also have heart infections due to it. Before heart surgery to have you fix all your teeth usually due to complications risks. Crazy stuff that we do not expect that can happen, so teeth pain and abscess are serious shit. Now I was tired of having cavities and getting drilled up. I felt so shameful for it. I started by getting my whole mouth fixed which I absolutely hated but it was necessary. I ended up needing a dental surgery on top of it all due to bad past dental hygiene and now I'm supposedly okay. Eventually I decided to try and get my shit together which was not easy at all mostly due to ADHD and no object permanence. How I managed to do it really was find moments where I was about to go in the bathroom to do something else and join it to this activity. Like whenever I was about to go out, like to go at work, I naturally got myself ready and so it was easy to integrate brushing my teeth. Also before going to bed or going in the shower. I love to shower. I don't mind it at all so I'll either bring my toothbrush in or just before heading in it. So that's 1 to 3 times already! ( Canadian dental association recommends 2x a day 2min quality brushing)It does not rely on memory and it's like mixed with another activity so it's less bothersome. It's like I might as well do it. As for flossing. I get the disposable picks with the integrated floss and I leave it in the shower. Since I shower almost everyday. I see the pick and I floss. I know it takes more time and waste more water but that's the absolute only way I've found so far that worked for me. I really liked water pick but my dentist clearly told me he had seen a notable degradation when I moved to it and he told me that was a very frequent mistake since it should be a complimentary add on to flossing and not a replacement for it at all due to the lack of mechanical action so I threw it away altogether, I don't need any extra step already. Now as far as toothbrush and accessories go. I've recently got a new electric toothbrush, I went from an Oral b that was quite intense and felt like a mini jackhammer in my mouth and it made such noise that I would accidentally end up doing echolalia to it involuntarily and hum all the time. I did not like it much and it got gunky quickly. I tried switching to a sonicare 4100, it is a different system altogether that uses ultrasonic vibrations so at first it's weird because it's buzzy but it's a LOT quieter, I don't go into accidental echolalia over it, I personally like it a whole lot more so far. It's also much more delicate in my mouth. Though the buzzing might not be for everyone. It doesn't seem to get as gunky which I don't understand why but yay. There's a pressure sensor to tell you if you're pushing too hard, there's a pacer to tell you how much time to spend on each section of your mouth and it stops automatically once the proper amount of time is done. So far I'm really liking it and am able to do my 2 min of brushing quite easily instead of just trying to get it done as quickly as possible. I personally don't mind mouth wash at all. As a matter of fact... I kinda don't feel the burn much, so I'll just take a small swig whenever I go in the bathroom. And last but not least, toothpaste, again, I'm lucky, I really don't mind the taste or the strength so I picked the most complete toothpaste possible that foamed up well enough for my preference, I use Colgate, total active prevention+ that is like anti sensitivity, antibacterial, restore enamel, whitens, I mean, it does everything no kidding. Sure it's more expensive but I had to have dental surgery due to not caring enough and that made these toothpaste feel very okay to spend money on. Also on the recommendation of my dentists, at night, I use another toothpaste called prevident 5000 sensitive that is both sensitivity protecting but has increased fluor to strengthen teeth. So yep. That's how I got my shit under control and at 35yo, never had such good dental hygiene and I'm really happy about it."

UgydoT3lXDA0t0i9-sd4AaABAg,2025-07-17 02:08:27,en,YOUTUBE,  I have to re forgive my family everyday you don't have to believe in the Bible to be a good person you just have to be spiritual and caring religion is political spirituality is pure at heart cuz my family has abandoned me spread lies about me scared my friends away people tend to believe Rumors in case they're true and this is very common actually domestic violence situations I've talked to other women that were isolated by their families and even their family and in smaller towns they even got the society to attack their whistleblower in the family victim blamed it helped to know I wasn't the only one but I didn't want them to suffer as I did of course though the rumors are not true and though I have a blood bone marrow disorder m e g a b l a s t i c anemia cuz I turned in my uncle to CPS in the cops for being a child molester raped my aunt and domestic violence towards kids and adults and he's been arrested for selling drugs and it's really sad I'm likely to die from this and my family could care less if I live or die. & when you're currently being still abused or neglected then you do have to forgive everyday cuz you're still currently being hurt once I die or get fully I will let go of it to a degree but I still have to forgive every day cuz my family has not changed and will not change the brainwashing has got a hold of them so tightly I tried domestic violence Stockholm Syndrome pamphlets and the cops didn't arrest him and usually according to statistics most people don't stop being brainwashed until the perpetrator is arrested and separated from them and that didn't happen and I mean just knowing that my family is willing to let me die you never the same again after that you just can't look at your family the same feel the same after that but I do have unconditional love for them I know they're not right in the head and they've been abused so I just have to remind myself that everyday when I am in pain and physically and emotionally from being alone and abandoned undying and so I read forgive everyday when it's all over I will fully Let It Go to the point where I move on with my life but there will always be this part of me that's like man they didn't care if I lived or died in the back of my mind but I unconditionally love them will also be in the back of my mind but I set boundaries to protect myself from them forgiveness is not always black and white and perfect and thought they cared about me because they always were there for me before they choose and abuser over me the only person in the family that was trying to protect the little ones and I know their brainwashed to be like that but still you know you would think they would snap out of it for fear of me dying but they won't cuz I have no in-home care I disqualified because you have to have someone already taken care of you to qualify for DSHS to pay for it and the doctor said I can't get better from it without slowly rebuilding my body back up again and I didn't get the chance to do that so I'm deteriorating and losing weight again and my bones have been shrinking before I went into the Hospital during Hospital stay and then illegally prematurely discharged and gaslighted by doctors and I wanted hyperbaric oxygen tank therapy the vitamin IV fluid they gave me help me gain my weight back but it's making my bones shrink it's not making my bones grow and I can't take oral vitamins I even tried patch vitamins and it didn't help my bones grow and it actually made them shrink worse than the doctor says I'm allergic to Vitamins because of the blood disorder and I'm like well I need hyperbaric oxygen tank therapy then and reverses autoimmune attacks against the body and he said that they didn't have it but they actually did he lied I found out after he discharged me illegally cuz you have to be fully stabilized before they can discharge you and not be at risk of dying if you get sent home and or getting medically worse at home and my counselor I saw before I got seriously sick said that the reason doctors Gaslight a lot of patience is cuz they want you to get sicker so you'll keep going back to more appointments making doctors more money so they keep you in the dark what's wrong with you and the more sick you get the more evidence of the treatment the more money they make it's a huge money market and they lied to her about her test results over the phone they said they were negative she requested her test results and paper form turned out she had a full blown skin cancer she did some research and like 90% of the patients at that same medical facility were also getting lied to about their test results and had to go somewhere else for a second opinion they had diabetes eventually diagnosed with thyroid disease and most of them some of them cancer and it's just horrific and I need my family to advocate for me I try to do it on my own none of the federal programs would do anything about the doctors illegal Medical malpractice lawyer would not do short-term help for me to help me get impatient about the hospital they only want long-term cases where they can make tons of money by suing the hospital which won't do me any good and I don't have the energy to Sue and I had a referral to see a hematologist and she said that they don't do bone drilling to test 4 bone marrow disorders unless your blood levels are below 40% because your insurance won't cover it and I said I will pay out of pocket and she refused to help me still and I said is there an alternative test my insurance does cover she lied and said no I found out she could have done a receptacle baby bone marrow red blood test and Medicare does pay for it and I could have been diagnosed and gotten treatment in 2019 and song deteriorating slowly and I have glaucoma now from my skulls shrinking and putting pressure on my brain in my eyes I have lesions and soft spots and it's just heinous with my family and did to me the victim blame me and then abandoned me and I have to forgive them everyday cuz I feel hurt everyday that they have been in me as I slowly die I remember it and it's hard to do so I give her prompts what honestly helped me forgive also is in Buddhism we learned that everything happens for a reason same with Native Americans spirituality wickedness and if you realize the good that comes from the bad and it give the incident purpose like I started volunteering and helping women and kids and that are going through the same thing I'm going through the domestic violence and in the classes they taught us that our Aura that has pain and suffering embedded in it can attract toxic people but in the class they didn't teach you how to purify your aura and I found some chakra healing to help you do that and also if you set boundaries and learn how to protect yourself better build up confidence help others set all can change your aura

TheGovernment of Maharashtra's Minister for Information Technology and Cultural Affairs Shri Ashish Shelar, along with the Chief Secretary of Maharashtra Government Shri Rajesh Kumar Meena and Secretary, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting Shri Sanjay Jaju will remain present amongst the dignitaries on the occasion. Conceptualized and spearheaded by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India, the Bharat Pavilion represents the country's aspiration to be a creative superpower. It is not just an exhibit but an immersive experience that reflects the I & B Ministry's commitment to nurturing the Orange Economy — powered by Content, Creativity, and Culture. Bharat Pavilion: A Landmark Initiative by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting In a celebration of India's timeless storytelling legacy and its dynamic leap into the future of global content creation, the Bharat Pavilion emerged as a centrepiece of the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES) 2025, held at the Jio World Convention Centre, Mumbai. Inaugurated by the Prime Minister of India, Shri Narendra Modi, the Pavilion stands as a tribute to India's cultural soul and its digital transformation from Kala to Code. The Pavilion is curated under the vision of Prime Minister Modi, who stated at the inauguration, “This is the dawn of the Orange Economy in India, and Bharat's stories have the power to connect the world.” The initiative also aligns with the Ministry's larger mission of transforming India into a global hub for media, entertainment, and storytelling innovation. The Bharat Pavilion is divided into thematic zones that trace India's evolution as a storytelling civilization: Shruti – Oral Traditions: From Vedic chants and folk tales to modern podcasts and music streaming, this zone celebrates India's sonic legacy. Kriti – Written Heritage: Showcasing the power of the written word, from ancient manuscripts to the digital age of journalism and publishing. Drishti – Visual Storytelling: Exploring India's influence on performance arts and cinema, from the Natyashastrato Bollywood and OTT platforms. This thematic zones structure exemplifies India's storytelling arc — where ancient wisdom meets modern innovation. The National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) played a key role in the curation and management of Pavilion content and outreach. The Government of Maharashtra, co-host to WAVES 2025, underscored its leadership in the creative industries by facilitating high-level partnerships and infrastructure investments, thereby reinforcing Maharashtra's position as the cultural and cinematic capital of India. The Pavilion served as a magnet for global dignitaries, artists, studios, and technology giants. Companies like Meta, Amazon, Google, Adobe, Dream Foundation, Jio, and over 180 firms participated in collaborative showcases, cementing India's place on the international content map. From community radio stations to cinematic legends, grassroots creators to global tech leaders, the Bharat Pavilion bridged diverse creative worlds. A landmark announcement during the summit included the Pavilion's relocation to the National Museum of Indian Cinema (NMIC), Mumbai, making it a permanent, interactive showcase for India's media evolution. As India embraces the Create in India, Create for the World philosophy, the Bharat Pavilion will continue to amplify indigenous IPs, democratize digital content creation, and foster collaborations through WAVES Bazaar, WaveX, and Creatosphere platforms.

The milestone marks significant progress on the $88 million military construction project, which will expand the Air Force's capacity to deliver world-class dental care and training to thousands of Airmen annually. Capt. Kelsey Liu, project officer and representative from the Defense Health Agency Facilities Enterprise, narrated the event and recognized the partnership and dedication that brought the project to this point. “Today, we celebrate more than a construction milestone,” Liu said. “We honor the collaborative effort that is shaping a facility designed to serve and train those who defend our nation.” Once complete, the 59,609-square-foot facility will house 82 dental treatment rooms—three more than the previous building—and accommodate 180 dental students annually. It will support general and specialty dentistry, radiology, dental labs, logistics, and educational programs including the Advanced Education in General Dentistry (AEGD-2) and the Air Force Oral Hygiene Course. Brig. Gen. Gwendolyn “Fiend” Foster, director of the San Antonio Military Health System and commander of the 59th Medical Wing, delivered remarks highlighting the project's long-term impact. “This new clinic is more than just a building; it's a promise kept,” Foster said. “It's a promise to our service members, their families, and our retirees. The new Dunn Dental Clinic will revolutionize how we deliver dental care to our beneficiaries.” She emphasized that the upgrade from a 1970s-era facility to a state-of-the-art clinic will improve patient flow, reduce wait times and incorporate the latest dental technology—offering higher-quality, more efficient, and more comfortable care. “For our staff, it means working in a world-class facility that gives them the tools they need to provide the best care possible,” she added. “This clinic ensures our dental teams have the best tools available to support the readiness of our forces and maintain the well-being of our community.” Col. Carl Bhend, commander of the 59th Dental Group, also spoke at the ceremony. “The new Dunn Dental Clinic is not only where we'll care for patients—it's where we'll shape the future of military dentistry,” Bhend said. “This expanded facility reflects our commitment to excellence in both care and training.” Following tradition, a small cactus was affixed to the final beam before it was raised into place, symbolizing good luck for the building and its future occupants. Guests also signed the beam before it was lifted. Col. Henry Kiss, chief of the DHA Facilities Enterprise Division, addressed the crowd and thanked the interagency partners who helped bring the project to life, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the 802nd Civil Engineering Group and the Structures Design-Build Team. The new facility is named in honor of Col. Samuel B. Dunn, a pioneer in Air Force dentistry known for innovation and leadership—qualities that Brig. Gen. Foster said continue to shape the clinic's mission. “We're building a facility that reflects that same spirit of service and innovation,” she said. “Today's beam is a symbol of strength and completion, but also a promise: a promise that we will continue to prioritize the health of our beneficiaries and the readiness of our Airmen.” Construction is expected to be completed in the coming months, with operations beginning after outfitting and final inspections.

Dementia Associated with Alzheimer's Disease Overview Dementia is a broad term that refers to a marked decline in cognitive abilities that affects a person's daily functioning. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, responsible for at least two-thirds of cases in people aged 65 and older. AD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that begins gradually and leads to worsening impairments in behavior and cognitive skills such as memory, understanding, language, attention, reasoning, and judgment. Although Alzheimer's itself is not directly fatal, it greatly increases the risk of other complications that can ultimately result in death. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's-related dementia usually requires a thorough evaluation, including medical history, cognitive assessments, physical and neurological exams, and sometimes brain imaging. Physicians first exclude other possible causes of cognitive decline, like vitamin deficiencies or thyroid issues. Cognitive tests evaluate memory, problem-solving, and language to identify patterns indicative of Alzheimer's. Brain scans, such as MRI or CT, help detect structural changes like brain shrinkage. More advanced diagnostic tools, including PET scans or cerebrospinal fluid tests, can reveal specific biomarkers linked to Alzheimer's, offering stronger confirmation. Currently, there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease since brain cell loss cannot be reversed. However, treatments are available to ease symptoms and enhance the quality of life for patients and their caregivers. Cholinesterase inhibitors are medications that help reduce cognitive symptoms such as memory problems, confusion, and impaired judgment by improving communication between brain cells and slowing symptom progression. The three FDA-approved drugs commonly used for Alzheimer's treatment include donepezil (Aricept) for all stages, and galantamine (Razadyne) and rivastigmine (Exelon) for mild to moderate stages.

The date and time for hand-down is deemed to be 10.30am 4th July 2025. I have three applications before me. The first in time is the Claimant's application dated the 11th July 2024 for an order that Reynolds Porter Chamberlain [""RPC""] be disqualified from representing the Defendant; Simons Muirhead & Burton LLP [""SMB""] due to a conflict of interest. RPC deny that there is any conflict of interest. The second application is an application by SMB issued on the 30th July 2024, for an order that the claim against SMB be struck out under CPR r.3.4(2)(a) and/or (b) and/or (c). In the alternative, SMB seek an order for summary judgment and that the claim be dismissed. The third application is an application by the Claimant dated 15th August 2024 for an order compelling SMB to file a Defence which should have been filed and served by 31st July 2024. The Claimant contends that the failure to serve the Defence and the SMB's application are an abuse of process. The Claimant appeared before me in person with the assistance of an interpreter or translator. The Claimant is a Russian citizen and has difficulty in understanding and communicating in English. Mr. Jack Steer, of counsel (instructed by RPC), appeared on behalf of SMB. I am grateful for their submissions. The hearing before me on 15th January 2025 concluded at about 4.40pm and I reserved judgment. The next day the Claimant sent me an email stating that there had been procedural irregularities during the hearing and asking that I direct a re-hearing and defer the handing down of my judgment. The Claimant alleged that although an interpreter was appointed to assist him, the interpretation provided was incomplete and inaccurate, leading to material omissions and distortions of the Claimant's submissions; the interpreter's identity and qualifications were not verified by the Court; the interpreter was not sworn in or affirmed, as required. [1] The Claimant sent a further email on 17th January 2025 to similar effect stating that he intended to obtain a transcript and audio recording to show the shortcomings of the hearing.

Purdenitix has emerged as one of the most talked-about supplements in the dental wellness space — promising stronger gums, fresher breath, and better resistance to oral infections. But does it really work? In this comprehensive review, we will examine everything about purdenitix — from its formulation and scientific backing to customer reviews, pricing, and side effects. Plus, we'll guide you on how to buy the authentic product directly from the official purdenitix website to avoid counterfeit supplements. Let's dive in to see if this trending oral formula is truly worth it. What Is Purdenitix? Purdenitix is a natural dietary supplement formulated to support long-term oral hygiene by strengthening your gums, fighting off harmful bacteria, and promoting an overall healthier mouth. Unlike typical toothpaste or mouthwashes that only offer surface-level solutions, this supplement targets the root causes of oral problems — including bad bacteria overgrowth, inflammation, and nutritional deficiencies. The supplement comes in the form of soft, easy-to-swallow capsules made with 100% plant-based ingredients. Its formulation is designed to be effective yet gentle, making it suitable for adults of all ages, especially those suffering from: How Does Purdenitix Work? The secret behind Purdenitix lies in its scientifically balanced blend of herbal extracts, antioxidants, and essential minerals. These ingredients work together to cleanse your mouth from within, reduce inflammation, and promote tissue regeneration. Here's how the process works: 1. Cleanses the Oral Microbiome The first step is detoxifying your mouth from harmful bacteria, fungi, and toxins. The ingredients in Purdenitix inhibit the growth of Streptococcus mutans, the bacteria responsible for cavities and gum disease. 2. Soothes Inflammation and Swelling Gum disease is often rooted in chronic inflammation. The formula includes potent anti-inflammatory compounds like turmeric, milk thistle, and berberine to reduce redness, swelling, and discomfort. 3. Strengthens Gum and Tooth Structure Minerals such as calcium, zinc, and magnesium help reinforce the structure of your teeth and gums, preventing further decay or receding. 4. Neutralizes Bad Breath By restoring microbial balance and removing harmful toxins, Purdenitix eliminates the root cause of halitosis (bad breath) instead of masking it. 5. Boosts Saliva Production and Oral Immunity A balanced oral microbiome boosts natural saliva production, which is your mouth's first line of defense against infection and acidity. Ingredients in Purdenitix – What Makes It Work? Purdenitix uses a synergistic formula of herbal extracts, plant compounds, and essential nutrients. Here's a look at the top ingredients and their oral health benefits: ✅ Milk Thistle ✅ Berberine ✅ Turmeric ✅ Artichoke Leaf Extract ✅ Beetroot Extract ✅ Dandelion Root ✅ Chicory Root ✅ Zinc & Calcium ✅ Key Benefits of Using Purdenitix Purdenitix is designed to provide all-around oral health benefits. Here's what you can expect: ✔ Stronger, Healthier Gums Users often report less bleeding and more resilient gums within weeks. ✔ Elimination of Bad Breath By targeting the root causes of odor — bacteria and toxins — your breath becomes fresher naturally...."

AML remains a significant clinical challenge, particularly for older or unfit patients who are not eligible for intensive chemotherapy. ""Receiving FDA orphan drug designation for ICT01 is a significant recognition of ICT01's innovative therapeutic potential to meet the urgent unmet medical needs of AML patients,"" said Stephan Braun , MD, PhD, Chief Medical Officer of ImCheck Therapeutics . ""This important regulatory milestone reinforces our confidence that ICT01 will become the first immunotherapy for AML patients and supports our goal of rapidly advancing ICT01 into pivotal studies based on the unprecedented results observed in the clinic to date."" In an oral presentation at the 2025 ASCO Annual Meeting , ImCheck reported results from the Phase I/II EVICTION study, evaluating ICT01 in combination with azacitidine and venetoclax (Aza-Ven) in newly diagnosed AML patients unfit for intensive chemotherapy. Remarkably high remission rates and a positive overall survival signal were observed across a broad range of molecular subtypes, in particular those that are typically less responsive to Aza-Ven. The combination demonstrated a clinically well-manageable safety profile, with Grade ≥3 adverse events consistent with the expected hematological toxicity of Aza-Ven and AML itself. ""Orphan drug designation is a catalyst,"" added Pierre d'Epenoux , Chief Executive Officer of ImCheck Therapeutics. ""It validates our regulatory strategy, de-risks and supports clinical development acceleration, and sends a strong signal about the unique potential of ICT01 to transform AML treatment as well as other solid tumor indications."" The FDA's orphan drug designation is granted to drugs and biologics intended for the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of rare diseases affecting fewer than 200,000 people in the United States. The designation is designed to encourage the development of therapies for underserved patient populations and offers benefits including tax credits for clinical trials, exemption from certain FDA fees, and up to seven years of marketing exclusivity upon approval. Additionally, the designation gives access to regulatory assistance for the drug development process. About the medical need in AML Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) remains a significant clinical challenge, particularly for older or unfit patients who cannot tolerate intensive chemotherapy. While the combination of venetoclax and azacitidine has become the standard non-intensive regimen, it is not curative and relapse rates remain high. Most patients are not eligible for stem cell transplantation, often due to age, comorbidities, or insufficient response, and face limited treatment options and poor overall survival. Despite AML's known sensitivity to immune-mediated control, current immunotherapies targeting PD-1, TIM-3, or CD47 have not delivered meaningful clinical benefit. This underscores the urgent need for novel immuno-oncology approaches. Recently, γ9δ2 T cells, with their cytotoxic activity and unique dual role in both innate and adaptive immunity, have emerged as promising immune modulators. Their association with reduced relapse and prolonged survival, particularly in the post-transplant setting, suggests that enhancing their anti-leukemic potential could offer a meaningful new treatment option for high-risk AML patients. About ICT01 ICT01 is a humanized, anti-BTN3A (also known as CD277) monoclonal antibody that selectively activates γ9δ2 T cells, which are responsible for immunosurveillance of malignancy and infections. The three isoforms of BTN3A targeted by ICT01 are overexpressed on many solid tumors (e.g., melanoma, urothelial cell, colorectal, ovarian, pancreatic, and lung cancer) and hematologic malignancies (e.g., leukemia and lymphomas) and also expressed on the surface of innate (e.g., γδ T cells and NK cells) and adaptive immune cells (T cells and B cells). BTN3A is essential for the activation of the anti-tumor immune response of γ9δ2 T cells. As demonstrated by data presented at past AACR, ASCO, ASH, ESMO and SITC conferences, ICT01 selectively activates circulating γ9δ2 T cells leading to migration of γ9δ2 T cells out of the circulation and into the tumor tissue and triggers a downstream immunological cascade through secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including but not limited to IFNγ and TNFα, further augmenting the anti-tumor immune response. Anti-tumor activity and efficacy of ICT01 have been shown in patients across several cancer indications. About IMCHECK THERAPEUTICS ImCheck Therapeutics is developing a new generation of immunotherapeutic antibodies targeting butyrophilins, a novel superfamily of immunomodulators. By unlocking the power of γ9δ2 T cells, ImCheck's innovative approach has the potential to transform treatments across oncology, autoimmune, and infectious diseases. The lead clinical-stage program, ICT01, has been advancing to late-stage trials, demonstrating a unique mechanism of action that modulates both innate and adaptive immunity. These""first-in-class"" activating antibodies may deliver superior clinical outcomes compared to first-generation immunotherapy approaches, in particular in rationale combinations with immune checkpoint inhibitors and immunomodulatory anti-cancer drugs. Additionally, ImCheck's pipeline compounds are progressing toward clinical development for autoimmune and infectious diseases. The company benefits from the pioneering research of Prof. Daniel Olive (INSERM, CNRS, Institut Paoli Calmettes, Aix-Marseille University), a global leader in γ9δ2 T cells and butyrophilins, as well as the expertise of a seasoned management team and the commitment of leading U.S. and European investors.

The Supreme Court has said money cannot be recovered by filing an FIR and seeking help of police as it quashed a cheating case against the producer of Bollywood movie ""Tanu Weds Manu"". New Delhi, Jul 18 (PTI) The Supreme Court has said money cannot be recovered by filing an FIR and seeking help of police as it quashed a cheating case against the producer of Bollywood movie ""Tanu Weds Manu"". A bench of Justices J B Pardiwala and R Mahadevan expressed displeasure over the approach of the Allahabad High Court in dealing with the petition of producer Shailesh R Singh for quashing of the FIR against him by complainant Kunal Jain. ""Money cannot be recovered, more particularly, in a civil dispute between the parties by filing a first information report and seeking the help of the police. This amounts to abuse of the process of law,"" the bench said. Singh was one of the producers of the 2011 film starring R Madhavan and Kangana Ranaut. Advocate Sana Raees Khan, appearing for Singh, said the complainant got the FIR registered by dragging a civil dispute into criminal case. The court, Khan said, must ensure criminal prosecution was not used as an instrument of harassment to pressurise the accused. She said the high court directed the petitioner to undergo mediation and deposit Rs 25 lakh to the complainant upfront before the mediation which would prejudge the outcome and defeat the very purpose of filing the quashing petition. While noting Khan's submissions, the bench said Jain might have parted with some money in accordance with the oral agreement and it could be that Singh owes a particular amount to him. ""We are quite disturbed by the manner in which the high court has passed the impugned order. The high court first directed the appellant to pay Rs 25,00,000 to respondent 4 (Jain) and thereafter directed him to appear before the Mediation and Conciliation Centre for the purpose of settlement,"" it said. The order went on, ""That's not what is expected of a high court to do in a writ petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution or a miscellaneous application filed under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 for quashing of FIR or any other criminal proceedings."" Whether a prima facie offence of cheating was committed by Singh was the question, the court said. “How many times the high courts are to be reminded that to constitute an offence of cheating, there has to be something more than prima facie on record to indicate that the intention of the accused was to cheat the complainant right from the inception,"" it said. The plain reading of the FIR does not disclose any element of criminality, it added. The top court referred to its 2024 verdict in case of Delhi Race Club v. Uttar Pradesh which it said ""exhaustively explained"" the law on what constitutes cheating and criminal breach of trust. The bench said instead of looking into the matter on its merits, the high court thought it fit to direct Singh to go for mediation and that too after paying Rs 25 lakh to Jain. ""We fail to understand why should the high court undertake such an exercise. The high court may either allow the petition saying that no offence is disclosed or may reject the petition saying that no case for quashing is made,"" the top court noted. The bench continued, ""Why should the high court make an attempt to help the complainant to recover the amount due and payable by the accused? It is for the civil court or commercial court as the case may be to look into in a suit that may be filed for recovery of money or in any other proceedings, be it under the Arbitration Act, 1996 or under the provisions of the IB Code, 2016."" The top court wondered why the high court was unable to realise the dispute was of civil nature. If Jain had to recover a particular amount, the bench said, he could either file a civil suit or seek other appropriate legal remedies but ought not be allowed to take the recourse of criminal proceedings. ""What is expected of the high court is to look into the averments and the allegations levelled in the FIR along with the other material on record, if any. The high court seems to have forgotten the well-settled principles as enunciated in the decision of this court…,"" the bench said and quashed the FIR against Singh.

Gürtel, Púnica, Kitchen y más de veinte causas judiciales sitúan al PP de Feijóo ante la mayor ola de corrupción El Partido Popular liderado por Feijóo se enfrenta a 28 procesos judiciales por corrupción con más de 150 cargos implicados El PP acumula 28 juicios por corrupción bajo la dirección de Feijóo con implicaciones históricas para la política española Estos incluyen las macrocausas más mediáticas como Gürtel, Púnica, Lezo, Kitchen, Erial, Novo Carthago, el Campus de la Justicia de Madrid o la desaladora de Escombreras en Murcia, así como otros procedimientos menores. En conjunto, los tribunales han puesto en evidencia la magnitud de la trama: más de 150 cargos públicos del PP están implicados en estos sumarios. Entre ellos figuran ex altos cargos populares como el expresidente Mariano Rajoy (implicado en la llamada Operación Cataluña), el exvicepresidente Rodrigo Rato, la exministra Ana Mato, el exministro de Interior Jorge Fernández Díaz, el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana y varios líderes regionales, como el expresidente murciano Pedro Antonio Sánchez o el exmandatario de Murcia Ramón Luis Valcárcel. La cuantía de las penas solicitadas es enorme: por ejemplo, la Fiscalía pide décadas de cárcel para Rato por fraudes económicos. Calendario judicial de las macrocausas pendientes El calendario judicial de estos procesos se extiende a lo largo de varios años. Entre los hitos ya conocidos destacan: Caso Rato (Audiencia Provincial de Madrid): El exministro Rodrigo Rato fue juzgado entre diciembre de 2023 y mayo de 2024 por delitos fiscales (caso Bankia) y uso indebido de tarjetas (tarjetas Black). Cumplió condena por estas tarjetas y tiene pendiente un juicio por un presunto fraude en la salida a bolsa de Bankia. Caso Erial (Audiencia Provincial de Valencia): En octubre de 2024 se dictó sentencia no firme contra el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana, condenado a 10 años y 5 meses de prisión por blanqueo, cohecho, falsedad documental y prevaricación en la adjudicación de estaciones de ITV (pelotazo de las ITV). Aún puede recurrirse este fallo ante el Tribunal Supremo. Operación Púnica (Audiencia Nacional, Madrid): La pieza principal del caso –el supuesto amaño de contratos de eficiencia energética a la empresa Cofely– tiene fecha de juicio: la vista oral empezará el 7 de abril de 2025 y durará hasta mayo. Se sentarán 37 acusados en el banquillo, incluidos nueve exalcaldes (siete del PP) de Madrid y Extremadura, por la adjudicación irregular de contratos municipales de más de 224 millones de euros. Además de esta pieza, otras diez piezas separadas de Púnica siguen pendientes de juicio. Operación Kitchen (Audiencia Nacional): El tribunal fijó el juicio para mayo-junio de 2026. En este caso se enjuiciará a los exministros del Interior Jorge Fernández Díaz y Francisco Martínez, así como a varios comisarios de Policía por la trama policial ilegal montada en 2013 para espiar al extesorero Luis Bárcenas. La Fiscalía solicita 15 años de cárcel para Fernández Díaz y Martínez. Caso Novo Carthago (Murcia): El proceso por la urbanización ilegal de Novo Carthago, en el que están imputados exconsejeros murcianos, sufrió un aplazamiento judicial. Debido a una huelga de letrados se ha pospuesto la vista oral hasta 2025. Caso Campus de la Justicia (Audiencia Nacional): En septiembre de 2024 la Audiencia Nacional condenó a 7 años de prisión a Alfredo Prada, exconsejero de Justicia de la Comunidad de Madrid en el Gobierno de Esperanza Aguirre, por prevaricación y malversación en contratos amañados del proyecto del Campus Judicial. Cuatro exdirectivos del proyecto recibieron penas menores (3,5 años). Caso Desaladora de Escombreras (Audiencia Provincial de Murcia): El expresidente murciano Ramón Luis Valcárcel enfrenta en julio de 2024 una vista de conformidad que podría evitar el juicio oral. Se le investiga por presuntos delitos de malversación, prevaricación y fraude en la construcción y rescate de la desaladora de Escombreras. La fiscalía pide 11 años de cárcel y fuertes inhabilitaciones. La jueza instructora ordenó en 2023 juicio oral contra Valcárcel tras advertir indicios de delito. Caso Gürtel: Varias piezas de esta trama originada hace años siguen su curso. Por ejemplo, en la pieza 5 (pelotazo Orange Market de los contratos de la Generalitat Valenciana) están pendientes sentencias próximas contra figuras como Francisco Camps. Asimismo, el Supremo debe resolver recursos contra la sentencia de la denominada caja B del PP, que condenó al extesorero Bárcenas. En la Comunidad de Madrid hay otra caja B investigada en una pieza separada del caso Púnica. En conjunto, quedan al menos cuatro causas Gürtel pendientes en distintas fases. Otros casos pendientes: El caso Lezo (gestión de Canal Isabel II) mantiene varias piezas con exconsejeros procesados, aunque aún no se ha fijado fecha de juicio definitiva. También continúan las investigaciones por las irregularidades en las cajas de ahorros (casos Caja B y Bankia) y el rescate de las autopistas radiales, con procesos judiciales abiertos donde el PP figura como responsable civil. Los magistrados Enrique López y Concepción Espejel han sido apartados de varios tribunales debido a sus acusados vínculos con el PP. Estos jueces, que llegaron a ser elegidos con el apoyo popular, habían sido recusados por la Fiscalía y la acusación popular por su “afinidad” al partido. El caso más reciente fue su relevo en el juicio de la financiación ilegal (caja B) del PP. Este tipo de recusaciones ha alimentado críticas de que existe una “instrumentalización de la justicia” con motivaciones políticas. Incluso el presidente Pedro Sánchez denunció públicamente casos de “lawfare” (uso político de la justicia), citando la Operación Kitchen como ejemplo de persecución política contra el PP.

En conjunto, los tribunales han puesto en evidencia la magnitud de la trama: más de 150 cargos públicos del PP están implicados en estos sumarios. Entre ellos figuran ex altos cargos populares como el expresidente Mariano Rajoy (implicado en la llamada Operación Cataluña), el exvicepresidente Rodrigo Rato, la exministra Ana Mato, el exministro de Interior Jorge Fernández Díaz, el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana y varios líderes regionales, como el expresidente murciano Pedro Antonio Sánchez o el exmandatario de Murcia Ramón Luis Valcárcel. La cuantía de las penas solicitadas es enorme: por ejemplo, la Fiscalía pide décadas de cárcel para Rato por fraudes económicos. Calendario judicial de las macrocausas pendientes El calendario judicial de estos procesos se extiende a lo largo de varios años. Entre los hitos ya conocidos destacan: Caso Rato (Audiencia Provincial de Madrid): El exministro Rodrigo Rato fue juzgado entre diciembre de 2023 y mayo de 2024 por delitos fiscales (caso Bankia) y uso indebido de tarjetas (tarjetas Black). Cumplió condena por estas tarjetas y tiene pendiente un juicio por un presunto fraude en la salida a bolsa de Bankia. Caso Erial (Audiencia Provincial de Valencia): En octubre de 2024 se dictó sentencia no firme contra el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana, condenado a 10 años y 5 meses de prisión por blanqueo, cohecho, falsedad documental y prevaricación en la adjudicación de estaciones de ITV (pelotazo de las ITV). Aún puede recurrirse este fallo ante el Tribunal Supremo.

En este caso se enjuiciará a los exministros del Interior Jorge Fernández Díaz y Francisco Martínez, así como a varios comisarios de Policía por la trama policial ilegal montada en 2013 para espiar al extesorero Luis Bárcenas. La Fiscalía solicita 15 años de cárcel para Fernández Díaz y Martínez. Caso Novo Carthago (Murcia): El proceso por la urbanización ilegal de Novo Carthago, en el que están imputados exconsejeros murcianos, sufrió un aplazamiento judicial.

Cuatro exdirectivos del proyecto recibieron penas menores (3,5 años). Caso Desaladora de Escombreras (Audiencia Provincial de Murcia): El expresidente murciano Ramón Luis Valcárcel enfrenta en julio de 2024 una vista de conformidad que podría evitar el juicio oral. Se le investiga por presuntos delitos de malversación, prevaricación y fraude en la construcción y rescate de la desaladora de Escombreras. La fiscalía pide 11 años de cárcel y fuertes inhabilitaciones. La jueza instructora ordenó en 2023 juicio oral contra Valcárcel tras advertir indicios de delito. Caso Gürtel: Varias piezas de esta trama originada hace años siguen su curso. Por ejemplo, en la pieza 5 (pelotazo Orange Market de los contratos de la Generalitat Valenciana) están pendientes sentencias próximas contra figuras como Francisco Camps. Asimismo, el Supremo debe resolver recursos contra la sentencia de la denominada caja B del PP, que condenó al extesorero Bárcenas. En la Comunidad de Madrid hay otra caja B investigada en una pieza separada del caso Púnica. En conjunto, quedan al menos cuatro causas Gürtel pendientes en distintas fases. Otros casos pendientes: El caso Lezo (gestión de Canal Isabel II) mantiene varias piezas con exconsejeros procesados, aunque aún no se ha fijado fecha de juicio definitiva. También continúan las investigaciones por las irregularidades en las cajas de ahorros (casos Caja B y Bankia) y el rescate de las autopistas radiales, con procesos judiciales abiertos donde el PP figura como responsable civil. Los magistrados Enrique López y Concepción Espejel han sido apartados de varios tribunales debido a sus acusados vínculos con el PP. Estos jueces, que llegaron a ser elegidos con el apoyo popular, habían sido recusados por la Fiscalía y la acusación popular por su “afinidad” al partido. El caso más reciente fue su relevo en el juicio de la financiación ilegal (caja B) del PP.

n3x6evj,2025-07-19 01:23:55,en,REDDIT,"  I just had a horrific eczema experience this year. I'm able to say now that I am almost completely eczema free, currently healing. They are all dried up and flaking off. The first few months I had it was after a bad panic attack next to a moldy toilet, post quitting smoking cannabis. My body was covered in it and my elbow crease was so bad that it got infected. Being stubborn about not going to the doctor for antibiotics, I eventually had to go to the hospital. Right there they gave me intravenous steroid and a topical that had 3 ingredients containing an antibiotic, antifungal and corticosteroid. They also prescribed me oral corticosteroid and antibiotic. Prior to hospital I was on week 3 of another antibiotic from an online doctor (clearly didnt work). These things seemed magical with how fast they worked. But as soon as I was done with the prescriptions, the eczema came back with a vengeance! It was covering my body worse than before. My face and neck were red and swollen and painful. I really should have rejected the steroid and only took antibiotic since it was necessary for infection. But these definitely made things worse in my case. But this led me to want to target the problem on my own with some trusted holistic sources and I had to tackle it from all angles with a lot of research being done. And I gotta say this worked for me. First off, limit your diet. At least until the problem subsides. All allergen free, especially dairy, gluten, and limit sugar, caffeine, produce with salicylates, nightshades. Eat Whole Foods, and lots of omega 3s. I've been eating a lot of salmon and seaweed. The seaweed chips are good to snack on. I also went intermittent fasting to help the body go into its repair mode. I would eat as much as I could between 2 pm and 7pm then fast for 19 hours. At night I liked drinking teas like dandelion, burdock root, nettle. . there's quite a few good for the skin. Supplementation - I used a full spectrum binder by codeage to rid of some mycotoxins and heavy metals that could be junking up the liver (this needs to be taken within its own 2 hour window and with lots of water). Organic msm sulfur crystals to help with detoxification. Magnesium, zinc, c, d and b vitamins, are essential (be mindful of quality). And a skin probiotic called skinesa (claims to clear 90% of problems in 3 months). The goal with these is to get the taxed liver and gut working again so your body doesn't send the toxic excrements through the skin. Topical - I really liked this line of products I found on yum.naturals created by a naturopathic doctor. There's instructions for each product. A calendula and chickweed lotion with DMSO (this can be quite intense as it pulls out the toxins that sit underneath the eczematic skin) and I personally use it every other day if that but you'll be amazed at what comes out. A clove pure relief antifungal which absolutely kept infections away this time and helped with the itch ( also contains colloidal silver making it antibacterial as well) . A jewel weed anti itch salve that kept spots moisturized and I liked spackling my cracks with it. All of these items contain 100% all natural ingredients, nothing lab made. Just be very mindful in using the lotion with dmso because it will bring any ingredient it touches deeper into your body. And also, DONT STRESS and do your best to relax. Stress triggers flare ups too. Some nights I'd get the itch real bad and the best method I found was to put 2 pairs of soft socks on my hands than tape them to a long sleeve so I couldn't unconsciously take them off at night. Within a month after the steroid, my skin has already lightened up and I'm very close to being eczema free. Now my mom can stop bothering me about going to the doctors. Hope this helps you or anybody out there struggling! I feel for you all that have to go through this and that this will be a distant memory one day. :)"

La cuantía de las penas solicitadas es enorme: por ejemplo, la Fiscalía pide décadas de cárcel para Rato por fraudes económicos. Calendario judicial de las macrocausas pendientes El calendario judicial de estos procesos se extiende a lo largo de varios años. Entre los hitos ya conocidos destacan: Caso Rato (Audiencia Provincial de Madrid): El exministro Rodrigo Rato fue juzgado entre diciembre de 2023 y mayo de 2024 por delitos fiscales (caso Bankia) y uso indebido de tarjetas (tarjetas Black). Cumplió condena por estas tarjetas y tiene pendiente un juicio por un presunto fraude en la salida a bolsa de Bankia. Caso Erial (Audiencia Provincial de Valencia): En octubre de 2024 se dictó sentencia no firme contra el expresidente valenciano Eduardo Zaplana, condenado a 10 años y 5 meses de prisión por blanqueo, cohecho, falsedad documental y prevaricación en la adjudicación de estaciones de ITV (pelotazo de las ITV). Aún puede recurrirse este fallo ante el Tribunal Supremo. Operación Púnica (Audiencia Nacional, Madrid): La pieza principal del caso –el supuesto amaño de contratos de eficiencia energética a la empresa Cofely– tiene fecha de juicio: la vista oral empezará el 7 de abril de 2025 y durará hasta mayo. Se sentarán 37 acusados en el banquillo, incluidos nueve exalcaldes (siete del PP) de Madrid y Extremadura, por la adjudicación irregular de contratos municipales de más de 224 millones de euros. Además de esta pieza, otras diez piezas separadas de Púnica siguen pendientes de juicio. Operación Kitchen (Audiencia Nacional): El tribunal fijó el juicio para mayo-junio de 2026. En este caso se enjuiciará a los exministros del Interior Jorge Fernández Díaz y Francisco Martínez, así como a varios comisarios de Policía por la trama policial ilegal montada en 2013 para espiar al extesorero Luis Bárcenas. La Fiscalía solicita 15 años de cárcel para Fernández Díaz y Martínez. Caso Novo Carthago (Murcia): El proceso por la urbanización ilegal de Novo Carthago, en el que están imputados exconsejeros murcianos, sufrió un aplazamiento judicial. Debido a una huelga de letrados se ha pospuesto la vista oral hasta 2025. Caso Campus de la Justicia (Audiencia Nacional): En septiembre de 2024 la Audiencia Nacional condenó a 7 años de prisión a Alfredo Prada, exconsejero de Justicia de la Comunidad de Madrid en el Gobierno de Esperanza Aguirre, por prevaricación y malversación en contratos amañados del proyecto del Campus Judicial. Cuatro exdirectivos del proyecto recibieron penas menores (3,5 años). Caso Desaladora de Escombreras (Audiencia Provincial de Murcia): El expresidente murciano Ramón Luis Valcárcel enfrenta en julio de 2024 una vista de conformidad que podría evitar el juicio oral. Se le investiga por presuntos delitos de malversación, prevaricación y fraude en la construcción y rescate de la desaladora de Escombreras. La fiscalía pide 11 años de cárcel y fuertes inhabilitaciones. La jueza instructora ordenó en 2023 juicio oral contra Valcárcel tras advertir indicios de delito. Caso Gürtel: Varias piezas de esta trama originada hace años siguen su curso. Por ejemplo, en la pieza 5 (pelotazo Orange Market de los contratos de la Generalitat Valenciana) están pendientes sentencias próximas contra figuras como Francisco Camps. Asimismo, el Supremo debe resolver recursos contra la sentencia de la denominada caja B del PP, que condenó al extesorero Bárcenas. En la Comunidad de Madrid hay otra caja B investigada en una pieza separada del caso Púnica. En conjunto, quedan al menos cuatro causas Gürtel pendientes en distintas fases. Otros casos pendientes: El caso Lezo (gestión de Canal Isabel II) mantiene varias piezas con exconsejeros procesados, aunque aún no se ha fijado fecha de juicio definitiva. También continúan las investigaciones por las irregularidades en las cajas de ahorros (casos Caja B y Bankia) y el rescate de las autopistas radiales, con procesos judiciales abiertos donde el PP figura como responsable civil. Los magistrados Enrique López y Concepción Espejel han sido apartados de varios tribunales debido a sus acusados vínculos con el PP. Estos jueces, que llegaron a ser elegidos con el apoyo popular, habían sido recusados por la Fiscalía y la acusación popular por su “afinidad” al partido. El caso más reciente fue su relevo en el juicio de la financiación ilegal (caja B) del PP. Este tipo de recusaciones ha alimentado críticas de que existe una “instrumentalización de la justicia” con motivaciones políticas. Incluso el presidente Pedro Sánchez denunció públicamente casos de “lawfare” (uso político de la justicia), citando la Operación Kitchen como ejemplo de persecución política contra el PP. Voces de la oposición recalcan que estas estrategias minan la imparcialidad y exigen garantías de neutralidad en los tribunales. En conclusión, la intensa actividad judicial ha convertido al PP de Feijóo en la formación política con más procesos abiertos por corrupción en España. Los 28 juicios por corrupción del PP previstos hasta 2029 marcarán la agenda política y judicial. El partido lo atribuye a casos del pasado anteriores a la actual dirección, mientras sus críticos lo interpretan como la mayor constelación de casos de corrupción en la historia reciente del país. El tiempo y los tribunales dirán hasta qué punto estas causas consolidan o desafían la credibilidad del PP en el poder"

Entre ellos destacan: • Caso Púnica: juicio oral iniciado en abril de 2025 con 37 acusados, incluidos 9 exalcaldes del PP, por amañar contratos por valor de 224 M €. • Caso Kitchen: juicio fijado para mayo–junio de 2026, con exministros del Interior como Jorge Fernández Díaz y Francisco Martínez, y altos mandos policiales, por el espionaje ilegal a Bárcenas. • Caso Lezo: varias piezas siguen en instrucción y otras están en fase de juicio oral, relacionados con exconsejeros madrileños y el Canal Isabel II. • Caso Erial: Eduardo Zaplana fue condenado en octubre de 2024 a 10 años y medio, pero la sentencia no es firme y está pendiente de recurso. • Caso Gürtel (piezas pendientes): nuevos juicios programados para febrero de 2025, como el de Arganda del Rey (exalcalde Ginés López), junto a recursos por caja B y otras piezas. • Desaladora de Escombreras: el expresidente murciano Ramón Luis Valcárcel está investigado por malversación. • Caso Novo Carthago (Murcia): vista oral aplazada a 2025 por huelga de letrados. • Campus de la Justicia: Alfredo Prada, exconsejero con Esperanza Aguirre, fue condenado a 7 años. • Caja B y financiación irregular del PP: varios recursos siguen pendientes en el Tribunal Supremo. • Presiones judiciales: se investiga la posible influencia del PP en jueces como Enrique López o Concepción Espejel. Novedad, hace muy pocos días ha salido a la luz el caso Montoro: el exministro de Hacienda Cristóbal Montoro ha sido imputado por presunta creación de una red de influences que favorecía a empresas gasistas inyectando fondos (“comisiones”) a su despacho Equipo Económico, cobrando al menos 7–11 M €, y facilitando reformas legales a la carta durante sus años en el Gobierno  ￼ ￼. Además se le atribuye el acceso indebido a datos fiscales confidenciales y participación en una supuesta estrategia continuada de tráfico de influencias, con implicación de otros altos cargos de Hacienda  ￼. Montoro se ha dado de baja del PP, y hay 28 personas más imputadas en la causa  ￼. 🧩 Y en el centro de todo esto, está Isabel Díaz Ayuso, con el caso fiscal de su pareja, Alberto González Amador, que acaba de ser procesado por fraude fiscal y falsedad documental, y contra el que la Fiscalía pide hasta 3 años y 9 meses de prisión por los más de 350 000 €, uso de facturas falsas y una presunta comisión encubierta de medio millón, además de otro expediente por corrupción en los negocios  ￼ ￼. Desde que se conocieron las imputaciones, él ha intentado demorar el paso al juicio recurriendo cada diligencia y reclamando primero un pacto y luego una apelación, lo que ha ralentizado el proceso  ￼ ￼. Mientras tanto, su entorno —incluido Miguel Ángel Rodríguez y la propia Ayuso— ha difuminado la gravedad de los hechos, difundiendo versiones contradictorias y filtrando correos supuestamente privados para desacreditar a los fiscales  ￼. A esto se suma la sombra del hermano de Ayuso, que en su día fue señalado por cobrar de empresas con contratos adjudicados por su Gobierno, lo que generó un conflicto político interno en el PP e investigaciones ante la falta de explicaciones convincentes por parte de la presidenta  ￼. Todo un catálogo de técnicas de encubrimiento, dilación procesal y confusión mediática que acompaña a Ayuso desde hace años y sigue ralentizando y enturbiando la rendición de cuentas Y, aunque es un caso más antiguo, se incluye aquí también a José Juan Cardona, el líder del PP en Ibiza vinculado al caso Scala, condenado por financiar con dinero público fiestas con prostíbulos masculinos, lujo y viajes privados. Su implicación aparece ahora como parte del repaso de todas las tramas del partido, en este periodo de intenso escrutinio. Se estima que al menos 30 causas seguirán abiertas hasta 2030, entre ellas Púnica, Lezo, Gürtel, Erial, Escombreras, Novo Carthago y otros. El Partido Popular no solo fue condenado como organización corrupta (en Gürtel), sino que en pleno verano de 2025 continúa enfrentándose a un aluvión de procesos judiciales históricos y recientes. La aparición del caso Montoro, sumada a las macrotramas en curso, prolonga la sombra de la corrupción hasta bien entrados los próximos años."

mov_E48230D0D9A7BF66AC98DF6736018C51,2025-07-19 13:18:03,en,WEB,"  Reed's 1975 album Metal Machine Music, there's one moment that is undeniably sweeter, more memorable, more perfect than any other. It's when you turn it off. You'll never regret that moment. Not today. Not tomorrow. And not for the rest of your life. The LP was released 50 years ago this week. Its cover is a backlit shot of ; he exudes New York street cool in leather and shades. Only for the first 10 seconds of the actual record, though, is there even a hint that this might be the start of a rock album, picking up perhaps from the howling feedback and distortion that closes European Son, the final track on 1967's . That hope is soon dashed. Metal Machine Music's vinyl grooves contain 65 minutes and three seconds of dissonant noise, screaming in your ear like a hell's-mouth chorus. There's no discernible melody, very little progression, and only at minute 62 and 46 seconds does the suggestion of a rhythm occur. Music magazine Creem reviewed it in a box that simply said, in capital letters, “NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO NO…” (plus a lot more “NOs”). So many fans returned it immediately after purchase that Reed's record company, RCA, withdrew the original vinyl LP within weeks. Remarkably, the album landed less than three years on from the release of Transformer (1972) – the masterful David Bowie and Mick Ronson-produced solo album, which included Vicious, Walk on the Wild Side and Perfect Day (on which Reed was beautifully accompanied by Ronson on piano). That album confirmed Reed as ; audiences adored it. But for the surly Brooklynite, was the problem. “I put out Metal Machine Music precisely to put a stop to all of it,” he declared in Victor Bockris's 1994 biography Transformer: The Lou Reed Story. “It was a giant f--- you. I wanted to clear the air and get rid of all those f---ing a--holes who show up and yell Vicious and Walk on the Wild Side.” It's the sort of truculence that Reed was famous for; his former Velvet Underground bandmate John Cale called him “a twisted, scary monster”. And that 'S' word crops up a lot. Bockris later noted that “it wasn't easy to make Lou a famous pop figure. He was a hard figure to market because the edges were so hard, and he was kind of scary, you know, a scary figure.” That extended to fans and friends alike. In Dylan Jones's oral biography David Bowie: A Life, the rock journalist Allan Jones describes seeing Reed's 1979 concert at London's Hammersmith Odeon, at which the crowd kept “calling out for his old songs… Lou eventually told us all to f--- off, so lo and behold a lot of people did.” When most of the audience had left, Jones added, “he started playing [the Velvet Underground's] Heroin, Waiting for the Man, and all the songs they'd been screaming for”. It was after the concert, though, that the writer was told by a press officer that Reed had left with Bowie, and he was invited to join them for dinner. Jones was seated at an adjacent table, he recalled, “and suddenly there was this kind of explosion, smashing glasses and Lou was dragging Bowie across the table and b---h-slapping him across the face”. He reported Reed screaming, “Don't you ever say that to me!” Eventually they were separated – and soon hugged and made up. But five minutes later, “David was being dragged across the table again, with far more ferocity this time, with Lou screaming, 'I told you not to say that!' This time he really went for it and was raining blows on Bowie's head.” Reed was hustled out of the restaurant, and Bowie left sitting at the table, “head in his hands… sobbing.” Jones suggested that Bowie had offered to produce another album for Reed, “as long as he got himself clean and straightened himself out. Which Lou obviously didn't like.” This for the man who had helped Reed to his only significant chart success – a Top 30 album and a Top 10 hit, for a song about transgenderism, fellatio and casual prostitution, no less. We'll put it down to coincidence that Bowie went into a studio less than six months later to begin recording Scary Monsters (and Super Creeps). (He said he'd got the title from a Cornflakes packet.) Others, though, would go further. When writer Howard Sounes approached the former Velvets' manager Paul Morrissey for his biography of Reed, the director of Andy Warhol's Flesh and Trash suggested that the book should be titled “The Hateful B—h” or “The Worst Person Who Ever Lived”, if it were to reflect its subject truly. As for Jones, who got into a scuffle with Bowie that same evening, when the singer realised he was a “f---ing journalist”, he was at least spared the sort of scorn that Reed regularly directed towards the press, usually delivered in a bored monotone that was at least in part borrowed from Andy Warhol, especially when responding to inane questions. “Would it be right to call your music gutter rock?” he was asked by an Australian journalist on arrival in Sydney in 1974. “Gutter rock?” Reed responds. “Oh yeah.” In the infamous Lester Bangs interview for Creem in 1975, though, it is the writer who appears both rude and petulant, and further takes advantage of having the last (printed) word by launching a tirade of (written) abuse at the artist and his work after the fact. On his 1978 album, Live: Take No Prisoners, recorded at the Bottom Line in New York, Reed let the press have it with both barrels. After giving a shout-out to Bruce Springsteen in the audience, who'd added his voice to the album cut of Street Hassle eight months earlier, Reed turns on critics Robert Christgau of the Village Voice and John Rockwell of the New York Times, mocking the venerable New York newspapers' tradition of calling him “Mr Reed” – “F--- you, I don't need you to tell me that I'm good.”..."

Asimismo, el Supremo debe resolver recursos contra la sentencia de la denominada caja B del PP, que condenó al extesorero Bárcenas. En la Comunidad de Madrid hay otra caja B investigada en una pieza separada del caso Púnica. En conjunto, quedan al menos cuatro causas Gürtel pendientes en distintas fases. Otros casos pendientes: El caso Lezo (gestión de Canal Isabel II) mantiene varias piezas con exconsejeros procesados, aunque aún no se ha fijado fecha de juicio definitiva. También continúan las investigaciones por las irregularidades en las cajas de ahorros (casos Caja B y Bankia) y el rescate de las autopistas radiales, con procesos judiciales abiertos donde el PP figura como responsable civil. Los magistrados Enrique López y Concepción Espejel han sido apartados de varios tribunales debido a sus acusados vínculos con el PP. Estos jueces, que llegaron a ser elegidos con el apoyo popular, habían sido recusados por la Fiscalía y la acusación popular por su “afinidad” al partido. El caso más reciente fue su relevo en el juicio de la financiación ilegal (caja B) del PP. Este tipo de recusaciones ha alimentado críticas de que existe una “instrumentalización de la justicia” con motivaciones políticas. Incluso el presidente Pedro Sánchez denunció públicamente casos de “lawfare” (uso político de la justicia), citando la Operación Kitchen como ejemplo de persecución política contra el PP. Voces de la oposición recalcan que estas estrategias minan la imparcialidad y exigen garantías de neutralidad en los tribunales. En conclusión, la intensa actividad judicial ha convertido al PP de Feijóo en la formación política con más procesos abiertos por corrupción en España. Los 28 juicios por corrupción del PP previstos hasta 2029 marcarán la agenda política y judicial. El partido lo atribuye a casos del pasado anteriores a la actual dirección, mientras sus críticos lo interpretan como la mayor constelación de casos de corrupción en la historia reciente del país. El tiempo y los tribunales dirán hasta qué punto estas causas consolidan o desafían la credibilidad del PP en el poder"

I own an Oral B iO 8, which I got off Amazon as a review sample - it was listed as RRP £450 or something absolutely ludicrous. I think the iO 10 or iO 11 is the newest one and I remember seeing it launch at somewhere around £600 with the travel case, charger and a couple of packs of spare toothbrush heads. Those toothbrush heads are 100% proprietary too and finding knock-off 3rd party versions is NOT easy. A pack of 6 heads is like £50 from Oral B, or they do 50% off (so £25) at several times during the year. However, what Oral B do, is list them (the brushes) at stupidly high prices, but then have them nearly always on 50%+ discount, to make it seem like a bargain that needs to be snapped-up. This isn't really on Tesco, but on Oral B for dodgy sales practices, although having the discount as Clubcard only is certainly eyebrow-raising."

n48a3vb,2025-07-20 20:57:58,en,REDDIT,"  Just to politely educate the CA1-3 reading along, this is a trap. It's never that simple. Here is how the situation will evolve itself in a classic ABA oral boards scenario: ""The child returns 6 wks later and still has some symptoms what do you do now? If you choose to continue to delay they will continue to come back with symptoms and the parents will get irritated. Eventually as you keep delaying they will develop the abscess and die. If you choose to proceed the child will progress into bronchospasm, laryngospasm and die on the table. The symptoms never fully resolve. The answer is to examine them and determine how severe it is before proceeding. Cancel if the secretions or exudate are visible from orbit, and the rhonci are audible under a jet engine. Otherwise proceed. These kids always come back with URIs. They always have them, and if we just go by the guidelines the case will never proceed. The parents have caught wind and have started denying it despite clear evidence of the crusted runny nose for fear of cancellation. It's very easy for dentists and parents to pressure anesthesiologists into proceeding without understanding what's at stake. When someone does a chart review they will see that the parents denied URI and start wondering what actually happened, but if they see the URI is present they will question why it wasn't cancelled. So you always document a mild URI with discussion of r/b/a and proceeding with extreme judiciousness after parental consent."
n48irw0,2025-07-20 21:43:50,en,REDDIT,"  Agreed! And when we started the methimazole, he was already taking the oral steroid and oral antibiotic, and I couldn't bear one more oral pill twice a day. Plus - at that time I didn't know about pill pockets and was having to fight to push the steroid pill down his throat and half the time he'd spit it out. Pull Pockets changed everything. He loved them! But then developed a chicken-allergy. Now we are using a Limited Ingredient Diet (duck, venison, rabbit, etc - NO CHICKEN) and we have stopped using Pill Pockets (b/c they are chicken) and now use Vetoquinol Pill Wrap (pork based) from Amazon. Plus it's made in the USA."

Ghana is at a crossroads, we either get it right now or end up destroying this beautiful country of ours. We have lived through periods of economic mismanagement by our two main political parties and Ghanaians have bought into your reset agenda. Your government's massive endorsement at the last general elections suggest you are our best bet for a total reset and you cannot afford to fail us otherwise we shall face the full wrath of our teeming unemployed youth who have nothing to lose when mayhem is visited on this country. Corruption and Galamsey are two twin plagues that affect the very foundation of our economy. We want to plead with you to be that voice and conscience to keep prompting and reminding his Excellency of his own promises to Ghanaians. Hon Eric Agbana, the MP for Ketu North, has said only about 4% of those arrested in galamsey are prosecuted and we don't mind whether it happened under NPP or NDC. What we do care about is that it is a failing on the part of government which has successively been controlled by you, the political class. This gives an indication of what actually happens and we are watching. We have been keeping in view occurrences as reported by our Fourth Estate. Meanwhile, NextGen Watch's corruption radar has the following that we are tracking: A. Cases in Court: 1. National Signals Bureau 2. Sky Train B. Cases Under Investigation 1. Chairman Wontumi and Akonta Mining [EOCO/POLICE CID/FINANCIAL INTELLIGENCE CENTRE] 2. Maxwell Kofi Jumah -GIHOC [POLICE CID] 3. Abdul Hannan Wahab & 1other - NAFBCO [ EOCO] 4.
