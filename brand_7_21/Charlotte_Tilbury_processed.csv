Learn more Charlotte Tilbury fans can get $117 worth of full-sized freebies with the summer beauty box(Image: Charlotte Tilbury) Charlotte Tilbury has gained a cult following due to her signature radiant formulas, universally flattering shades, and high-performance skincare. Now, beauty enthusiasts can snag eight of the celebrity makeup artist's products for half off as part of a limited-time deal. The brand has rolled out its Summer Icons Beauty Box, offering a rare opportunity to grab some of Charlotte's most adored makeup and skincare essentials at an almost unheard-of 50% discount. Unlike previous mystery boxes where the content was a surprise, this time Charlotte has disclosed every item in advance, so shoppers know exactly what they're investing in. The Summer Icons Beauty Box is a handpicked collection of Charlotte's most sought-after products, including seven full-size icons and a travel-sized Charlotte's Magic Cream, all neatly packed into a luxurious gift box. Valued at $233, it's priced at $116, meaning each item inside average at $14.50 apiece.

Shoppers will also receive the Hypnotising Pop Shot in Diamond Eyes, a sparkling champagne eyeshadow that adds instant glam. For lips, the Lip Lustre in Blondie provides a glossy, peachy-nude finish perfect for summer days or nights, while the Cheek to Chic blush in Ecstasy offers a radiant, soft-focus glow that flatters all skin tones, reports Liverpool Echo. Summer Icons Beauty Box Charlotte Tilbury Product Description In Charlotte's Summer Icons Beauty Box, discover the beauty icons you will adore – and not just for summer. Charlotte has curated a mystery box of summer beauty secrets with a magical 50% off, giving everyone, everywhere the secret to a gorgeous glow, all year round. The box also includes the Pillow Talk Eyeliner and Push Up Lashes Mascara Eye Kit for definition and lift without smudging - a summer essential for long, hot days. Rounding out the set is Charlotte's Magic Hydration Revival Cleanser, which dissolves makeup while hydrating the skin, and a travel-size Magic Cream, her top-selling moisturizer that plumps and preps your skin with a radiant finish. Mirror writer Beth reviewed Charlotte's Magic Hydration Revival Cleanser when it launched and said: ""The cleanser effortlessly removed makeup and impurities without stripping my skin of its natural moisture, and after rinsing it off, I was pleasantly surprised by how smooth and clear my skin felt."" However, she did note it had a ""sticky texture"", which she was not a fan of. Charlotte Tilbury isn't the only beauty retailer to embrace the new summer season as Sephora has launched its Vacay All Day Makeup Value Set. Worth $125, the kit costs $50 and includes nine must-haves to keep you hydrated and glowing all summer long. Or there's the Black Honey Makeup Vault Set available at Ulta Beauty. Coming in at $138, the four-piece set includes Clinique's cult-classic shade, plus Pink Honey Almost Lipstick all in a clutch. The Charlotte Tilbury edit is a good opportunity for die-hard fans to replenish their collection, or for newcomers to sample the brand's offerings at a significantly reduced price. The only hitch is that the shades are pre-determined, so they might not be your first choice, but generally, they seem to suit most skin tones without any outlandish colors. Now that all items have been unveiled and the price has been halved, shoppers can check out the Charlotte Tilbury summer set here."
mov_DBB09078A48717073FC8B4944E3CE46A,2025-07-14 20:04:27,en,WEB,"  While Amazon Prime Day may have wrapped up, Charlotte Tilbury's summer sale is still going strong and Irish shoppers can snap up some of the brand's most-loved products at huge discounts - including up to 50% off. One of the standout offers is the return of Charlotte's Mystery Boxes, packed with four full-size makeup and skincare favourites. There are two versions to choose from - 'Pretty Pink and 'Cheeky Peach - each tailored to a specific colour palette. Whether you love a rosey glow or a peachy finish, there's something here to suit your style. Each mystery box normally costs €131, but is now on sale for just €65 - or you can grab the duo for €130 (down from €260) if you want to mix and match. As the name suggests, the exact contents are a surprise - but Charlotte Tilbury has given a few hints. Promo images show silhouettes of what look like lipsticks (€37), blush palettes (€44), mascaras (€32) and possibly a skincare treat. And while shades and formulas are kept secret, everything will stick to either the pink or peach theme - great for summer makeup bags. Irish fans of the brand know these mystery drops tend to sell out fast, and previous versions have included everything from the Beautyverse Palette to Magic Cream minis, making them serious value for money. Elsewhere, LookFantastic's July beauty box - worth over €150 - is currently at €20 and contains products from Molten Brown, Avant, This Works and more. And the Boots' Festival Edit Beauty Bag is €55 and worth €190.95. With the likes of Milk Makeup, Too Faced, Kylie Cosmetics and more inside, it's a real treat that'll help cure any festival blues. While the new Charlotte Tilbury Mystery Boxes are a real treat regardless of what's inside, the only nuisance would be receiving a product that is not quite the right shade for the shopper's skin tone or type. If you'd prefer to know exactly what you're getting, there are plenty of other summer offers worth checking out. The Charlotte's Summer Icons Box is down to €117 from €235 and includes seven full-sized favourites, including the Matte Beauty Blush Wand, Pillow Talk eyeliner, Push Up Lashes mascara and a travel-sized Magic Cream. There's also the Hollywood Flawless Filter and Airbrush Flawless Foundation Duo for €52 (usually €104) - a cult combo beloved by makeup artists and influencers alike. Charlotte Tilbury's international shipping means Irish beauty lovers won't miss out, and delivery is available across the country for €3.95 - or free on orders over €59. Whether you're topping up your makeup bag or trying something new, this is a chance to bag luxury products at a fraction of the price.

mov_036EC18E7ACB83CA458E68138F9C7EB3,2025-07-16 05:43:14,en,WEB,"  Balmy evenings call for a touch of golden-hour glamour – AVA WELSING-KITCHER shares 5 must-try makeup hacks for just the right amount of afterglow Go bold with your bronzer Going big on bronzer is a classic vacation look for a reason. Start with an understated formula, such as Charlotte Tilbury's Beautiful Skin Sun-Kissed Glow Bronzer, adding a fingerprint-sized amount inside the hollows of your cheeks, along your jawline and across your chin and temples. For a matte take, add a touch more across your eyelids and the bridge of your nose, before blending everything out with your fingertips. If a spot of shimmer is more your thing, swipe Westman Atelier's Lit Up Highlight Stick in Brûlée where you'd normally apply blusher, starting on the cheeks, just below your hairline and on the bridge of your nose and eyelids. Finish with a bold lip – there's nothing quite like a vibrant coral or crimson shade against bronzed skin to make your skin pop; Gucci Beauty's Odalie Red and Westman Atelier's Le Rouge are both worthy vacation wins. Look to molten eyes Matte eyeshadow and cat-eye liner are just too much on a balmy night – instead, look to metallic finishes that are easily blended with a fingertip should they settle into creases. Hourglass's Eyeshadow Stick in Solstice, a shimmery bronze, sets in mere minutes, so work quickly and on one eye at a time. You can then top lids with a powder metallic eyeshadow in a similar shade, or add a contrasting tone to transform it. Try Sisley's Les Phyto-Ombres Eyeshadow in Sparkling Topaz for a universally flattering copper finish while Charlotte Tilbury's Luxury Palette in Pillow Talk has all your vacation-ready shades in one. To complement the look, swipe a couple of fingers across your chosen shade and mix with a body oil in your hands to pick the hues out across limbs and décolletage; finish with fresh skin and lashings of brown mascara to keep everything soft yet defined. Dial down the base For perfect holiday skin, look for light textures (akin to moisturizers and serums) that offer slight coverage rather than a full on foundation. Charlotte Tilbury's Hollywood Flawless Filter has become a cult product for good reason: its hybrid formula combines the coverage of a tinted serum, the luminosity of a highlighter and the prepping power of a primer to deliver a softly diffused finish. Spot-conceal any blemishes or dark under-eye areas, then add a touch of Sisley's Blur Expert Powder to patches prone to sweat or oiliness. Glow head to toe Make the most of your new tan by adding luminosity to your body care, too, locking in moisture straight out of the shower with a few drops of 111Skin's Rose Gold Radiance Booster mixed into Dr. Barbara Sturm's Super Anti-Aging Body Serum – a beautifully hydrating formula that feels nearly invisible on skin. For extra shine, add the luminizing drops to a body oil – such as Augustinus Bader's velvety formula – instead. Then finish with a full-watt effect by running Hourglass's Vanish Flash Highlighting Stick in Champagne Flash – a luminous gold – or Westman Atelier's Lit Up Highlight Stick in Nectar – a radiant golden-peach – along your shins, collarbones and shoulders before hitting the beach bar. Super-boost your blush If you're sunburnt, you may want to sit this one out, but otherwise, amplify that healthy vacation flush while it lasts with a hit of blusher. Our tip? Opt for warm tones over cool: coral, rosy pink, peach or terracotta work at different intensities across all skin tones. Westman Atelier's Blush Stick in Minette is the perfect suits-all coral, with its melt-in formula for easy reapplication – well worth popping into your clutch for the night. For something punchier, try Clé de Peau Beauté's Cream Blush in Pale Fig, a vivid rose, that truly brings out the warmth in freshly tanned skin. Powder formulas work just as well when layered into skin. We love Hermès Beauty's Rose Hermès Silky Blush Powder in Rose Tan, a golden pink. Press the cream formula onto your complexion straight from the stick or dab the powder with a damp makeup sponge first and take it across cheeks, temples, eyelids and the bridge of your nose to mimic a natural sun flush, before swiping across your lips and adding a balm.

Jergens Natural Glow Firming Self-Tanner Body Lotion so you can gradually buildup a sunkissed glow over the course of a few days, without needing to experiment with any finicky streaking self-tanners. This is formulated with collagen and elastin so your skin can appear firmer and glowier — all for a lot cheaper than competitors or the very expensive spray tan salon. Promising review: ""I'm really impressed with this product. It's very easy to apply, the same way you would any lotion. It absorbs quickly into the skin. There is a very light, pleasant fragrance. I had no issues with the application or streaks. The tanning lotion gives a nice bronze appearance to the skin, which is what I was looking for. The sunless tanner allows you to continue to build the color until you reach your desired look."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $10.47 (available in Fair to Medium, Medium to Deep). 2. A set of DEET-free handy mosquito-repelling bracelets you will be incredibly grateful you have on hand when those bugs start coming out this summer. Powered by essential oils such as citronella, these bands can help repel the pests without the need to douse yourself in bug spray several times a day. No mosquito will dare approach you as you embark on your daily adventures; these bracelets can help keep any creepy-crawlies far, far away! Cliganic is a small business that specializes in all-natural personal care products. Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action. Promising review: ""I moved last year from Southern California to North Carolina. Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD. Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" —Tracey Agopian Get a ten-pack from Amazon for $8.99. 3. And the Bug Bite Thing for those of you trying to enjoy a nice day out, because nothing ruins a good outing like a painful or itchy bug bite. This handy tool sucks up all of the saliva and venom that creepy crawlies leave behind in their wake — reducing any swelling, itchiness, or redness. No smelly creams or chemicals required! Bug Bite Thing is a family-owned small business established in 2017 that specializes in bug bite relief products. This works on mosquitoes, bees, wasps, biting flies, sea lice, and more (seriously where was this on my last hiking trip?) Promising review: ""I bought this because I saw it on TikTok, and have been having issues with mosquito bites. Used it a few times to relieve itchiness and I am convinced it works! Have been recommending it to my family and friends. Read the directions and follow them carefully. Don't use this on your face or neck, or other sensitive areas. Don't do a lot of suction, just a little bit. And do it a few times if needed. Great invention!"" —Joe Get it from Amazon for $9.95 (available in five colors and multipacks). 4. A three-pack of vintage-inspired polarized sunglasses to make you look like you dropped $ on RayBans, but sans the crippling worry of accidentally dropping 'em. No need to fear losing these bad boys while lounging poolside at that fab resort you booked — these glasses are not only super cute but extremely affordable, so you can keep a backup pair (or two) for the days you misplace these at the tiki bar. Promising review: ""I've been buying these for years. They replaced my Ray-Bans that look identical!..."

However, if you're aiming for younger, brighter and healthier skin without emptying your wallet, beauty enthusiasts may have discovered the ideal, budget-friendly cream to incorporate into your skincare regime for that Botox-like effect at less than £10.

This cream, which has taken TikTok by storm due to its anti-ageing prowess, is intended to be used as a night cream, taking your beauty sleep to unprecedented heights. The anti-acne cream is praised for speeding up skin cell renewal while clearing blocked pores and reducing acne formation. Promoting rapid cell turnover also aids in stimulating collagen production beneath the skin, enhancing skin texture and erasing fine lines, lightening skin discolouration, and boosting natural radiance in the complexion. This 2% retinol pomade also works to curb melanin production, which can be a game-changer in the fight against age spots and hyperpigmentation. While boosting collagen production to minimise wrinkles and lines, this retinol cream leaves your skin smoother, brighter and rejuvenated, as if you've turned back the clock, reports the Mirror. One ardent fan of this retinol cream took to TikTok to sing its praises. When quizzed about ""how many units of Botox"" she had, the 36 year old gleefully responded that she ""loves when people ask her this!"" and revealed she ""has never gotten anything done! Zero units of Botox."" Mariel then continued to enthuse, ""I don't think you understand the power of a good retinol. This product has changed my face so much."" She also shared that followers have told her she looks like she's ""ageing backwards."" The ""Botox in a tube"" product she raved about is currently up for grabs on Amazon in this set. It includes two tubes of beauty buffs' favourite retinol cream at the very purse-friendly price of £4.99. You can also snag a three-pack for £7.99 or just the one for £2.99. If the price tag doesn't faze you, you can find this Retinal Supreme MultiCream over at FaceTheory for £39, or pop over to Lookfantastic, where the cult-favourite Medik8 Crystal Retinal 3 Serum is available for £49."

These new tinted lip oils feel like a lip gloss and oil hybrid. They're slick, high-shine and somehow not sticky at all, which makes them ideal for those who don't typically like a lip gloss, but want gleaming, shiny lips. The new lip oil comes in six ""juicylicious"" colors: Pink Watermelon, Strawberry Vanilla, Coconut Water, Cherry Glaze, Pure Peach and Candy Fig. As the names suggest, each oil smells just like its matching fruit essence. Packed with moisturizing hyaluronic acid microspheres and vitamin E, these new Nectar Oils don't just look good on, they also work to plump and hydrate your pout. I got my hands on two shades ahead of the launch (Cherry Glaze and Pure Peach) and can't seem to put them down. Since they have an oil-based formula, they glide on and stay put without that sticky feeling. The colors are subtle and buildable, and the easy-glide gel applicator makes swiping them on a breeze.

Formulated to plump and rehydrate under-eyes, the patches work to revive tired, puffy skin in just 15 minutes, and they're great to use before a special event. Currently on offer at Amazon, a box of 20 pairs is now reduced to £15.96 from £19.95. The Nip+Fab Jelly Patches are formulated with hyaluronic acid to hydrate skin and reduce dryness instantly, tremella (also known as snow mushroom) to tackle fine lines and wrinkles, and polyglutamic acid which holds four times more water than hyaluronic acid. Elsewhere on Charlotte Tilbury, the Hollywood Skin Secrets Immediate Eye Revival Patches, £58, are packed with Bio-Smooth Eye Contour Complex to depuff and hydrate under-eyes in 10 minutes. ESPA Isotonic Hydra Gel Eye Masks are formulated with minerals, antioxidants and natural extracts that help plump, brighten, and soothe tired eyes. Shoppers can get them at Next, where they cost £36.50. Ruth explained that the jelly patches made her fall in love with Nip+Fab and she has even partnered with the brand to test out other products. In a recent post on Instagram, she said: ""I just want to talk to you about this Nip+Fab, I was introduced to this brand by my make-up artist who's using this on me. It's lovely, hydrating jelly eye patches that you might have seen me, on Instagram, the bright green ones under my eyes."" The jelly patches have also gained approval from shoppers on Amazon, earning them an overall 4.4 out of five average star-rating. One said: ""I have super sensitive eyes and wear contact lenses and these don't cause any irritation or stinging, even if very close to the waterline."" A second shared her tip: ""I pop these right at the back of my fridge so they are extra cold, once on they stay cold for at least 20 plus minutes they are also thick but not too thick unlike others I've used are really thin and slip off, my eyes feel refreshed after using these."" However, one questioned the efficacy of the patches and penned: ""Still early days they seem to leave my under eye feeling smooth, however I could only really lie down when applied as they just slide down your face, which if you're busy and multi-tasking, it isn't great."" Another said the masks aren't 'particularly hydrating' and 'slide significantly'. But someone else added: ""Love these eye patches.

It is also now a fantastic 51% off at Amazon. The Shark SmoothStyle heated brush and comb is now just £49.49 in a brilliant price drop down from £99.99. This is saving shoppers a massive 51%. The Shark SmoothStyle is an all-in-one smoothing hot brush and comb for wet and dry hair. The hair tool creates voluminous styles with a smooth, soft finish and is said to be 'perfect for all hair types.' CHARLOTTE TILBURY LIPSTICK: Fans can snap up Charlotte Tilbury's best-selling lipstick for under £3 with this trick PERFECT SUMMER PRIMER: I've found the perfect summer primer that keeps my makeup on all day for just £10 You can dry, volumise, and style with no heat damage with the Shark SmoothStyle, which has two modes in which to style your hair. In wet hair mode, SmoothStyle never reaches heat-damaging temperatures, meaning your hair will be protected. You can also twist to select between three air temperatures, giving you plenty of choice. If you are looking for a different option, Boots is selling the BaByliss Air Style 1000 for £75, while another option is the Revamp Progloss Deepform hair straightening brush for £59.99 from Currys. In dry hair mode with the Shark SmoothStyle you can smooth, align, and shape your hair for weightless bounce. Ideal for refreshing second-day hair, taming unruly bedhead, smoothing out ponytail creases, and more. Thanks to its integrated ceramic-coated comb dry hair is smoothed with lower hair temperatures for a soft, bouncy, healthy-looking finish. Many shoppers have raved about the Shark SmoothStyle. One said: ""Bought another Revlon too in the hope that the difference would be negligible but I must admit the Shark is worth it. Yes it's a little bit heavier, but I dried my hair on a much much cooler setting than with the Revlon and my hair is so smooth I can't stop touching it, and with a lovely wave using the plates, rather than sizzling it with the GHDs which I normally have to do after drying."" Another added: ""Honestly the best hair tool I have used. I've had other very highly rated brands that did a good job but this shark smooth style is another level."" A third said: ""I can't believe how great this product is! Being a long-time user of similar hair tools, I must say this one exceeds all my expectations. It's incredibly easy to use and takes all the fuss out of tidying and smoothing hair."" One person said the brush was too heavy, they said: ""Had to return this , it was very well made but just too heavy."" Another option for a hot air styler is John Lewis for the BaByliss Air Power Volume hot air styler for £54.40."
n3nbofe,2025-07-17 15:31:43,en,REDDIT,  I've only used the charlotte tilbury but I really love it. No complaints at all. It's lasted a very long time as well. A great finisher! Doesn't come with a beauty blender thing so I just bought some puffs on Amazon.
1m2c1j1,2025-07-17 16:24:41,en,REDDIT,"  No matter whether I use primer or not, moisturize or not, use a powder concealer or cream concealer, set with powder or not, use a little or cake it on, use a brush or blender; my nose is always nice & even for about two hours before it separates and looks like that :( I've used Makeup Forever, Charlotte Tilbury, Estée Lauder, Tarte & KIKO Milano's concealers. As for powders, I've used Laura Mercier, Flower Knows and a Korean brand called seven7een. I've tried Too Faced's primer & Charlotte Tilbury's. I gave Elf's power grip a try but I couldn't keep it on long enough to see if it had a significant effect, it felt horrible on my face and I couldn't keep it on, felt suffocated, gave it away. I've seen people recommend LA girl's pro concealer but I can't get that here and Amazon's delivery fees are crazy so I don't want to get it if I'm not sure it'll work for me. Honestly the only thing I've noticed making a significant difference is Flower Knows' powder but that still doesn't prevent the separation. I've also tried putting on some Vaseline before putting the concealer on and it helps a bit but again, it's so heavy on the face. I understand that no matter what, makeup won't look perfect after a while but my nose makeup separates so quickly! If there's no other solution for me but using heavy primers like Vaseline or power grip then I understand, I just wanted to see if anybody else had a better suggestion for a girl that struggles with sensory issues :("

Here she talks us through her typical working day… By Nana Acheampong Save To My Favourites Image: @tobi. asare All products on this page have been selected by our editorial team, however we may make commission on some products. Borough Market 4.18am This is the exact time that my alarm goes off. I've calculated that gives me exactly enough time to be ready for the gym. I am woken up either by my phone alarm or my Whoop band. The first thing I do when I wake up is check my phone. It's bad, I know, but I need to check that there have been no disasters overnight that need my attention. I then brush my teeth and put on some SPF. Garnier Ambre Solaire SPF 50+ Sensitive Advanced Sun Cream Face & Body is my current go-to. My morning soundtrack is anything by Beyoncé, I love the latest album even more after seeing her live. I also take a shot of Symprove before I leave. 4.50am My gym is only a six-minute drive from my house. In summer I wear shorts and a bra top to work out in. Most of my kit comes from lululemon, Oner Active and Sweaty Betty. I work out a minimum of five times a week, mixing it up with cardio, strength training and PT sessions. When I am strength training, I wear Nike Metcons and for running, I wear Nike Journey. 6am I have my protein shake as soon as I get back from the gym. It's a mixture of protein powder, collagen and creatine with water. I then go and give my children a cuddle before heading into the shower. My favourite body wash is Naturium The Glow Getter  Body Wash  followed by the body butter. I go in quickly with a spritz of my favourite scent, Encelade by Marc-Antoine Barrois. On my face, I use Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Exfoliant followed by Koba moisturiser. Make-up starts with Danessa Myricks Beauty Yummy Skin Blurring Balm Powder and I always use Fenty's  foundation – it's the best. I use the By Terry eye liner and I mix blushers from Merit and NARS. Finally, I set everything with Charlotte Tilbury's setting spray and in the evenings, I use the one from ONE/SIZE. 7am I'm definitely a magpie but my style is also defined by clean lines. I find Lisa Ing Marinelli's take on fashion really inspiring – she's someone who also has a corporate job but embraces her personal style. If I had an endless budget, I would go to Tove every season. I just bought one of my favourite summer dresses from the brand. I'm also a big fan of Rejina Pyo. On the high street, I love COS and Massimo Dutti. I only give myself about ten minutes to get dressed before I have to leave the house – either to get the kids to school or catch the train to work...."

mov_2F38876B03DA981E074B56DEB6BD6AC6,2025-07-19 16:01:02,en,WEB,"  But if you did, then you should know that this $7 alternative to the $25 Black Honey lippie and this $4 alternative to the $65 Pink Sugar perfume are soooo worth the hype. 1. A tinted lip balm that's eerily close to the same magic as ""Black Honey,"" TikTok's beloved $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique, that it will genuinely startle you — especially when you see the price. This is a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lippie that's just a step above the ""no makeup makeup"" look, giving the perfect subtly polished effect. I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference! Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (also available in the pink honey version, and in a two-pack that mixes both!) . 2. Gold Bond's firming neck and chest cream your skin will be SO happy to soak up — this is formulated with aloe, salicylic acid, and jojoba oil to help hydrate, tighten, and gently exfoliate your skin so effectively that you should be able to see early results in two weeks. Reviewers especially love how affordable this is compared to creams that often cost three times this $12 price tag (or more)! Promising review: ""I am a lotion user every single day. I use face moisturizers that I love. I am over the moon by how good this is. I mainly use it on my neck, hands and forearms. The difference is amazing. My skin actually feels so good. I wish I could but larger containers of it."" —Kimberly P. Get it from Amazon for $11.97. 3. A TikTok-beloved ""Soft"" perfume rollerball that honestly has no right smelling so delectable and layering so well considering it's only five cash dollars. Reviewers are obsessed with the scent's warm sweetness with a hint of citrusy zest, comparing it to waffle cones, lemon pound cake, and warm vanilla scones ... and this $65 bottle of Pink Sugar  . Promising review: ""Like so many, I found this scent on TikTok. I was a bit skeptical at first but finally got around to trying it. First off, this scent smells amazing! Almost every time I've worn it, I receive compliments. It has a sweet smell, almost like warm cake or sugar cookies with a hint of lemon. With such an affordable price, I would definitely recommend this to anyone curious about trying it."" —Chrissy Get it from Amazon for $4.16. 4. An easy-to-apply one-hour (!!) self-tanner so much cheaper and more effective than its competitors (like the $46 St. Tropez) that your medicine cabinet will laugh at the old versions you used. This vegan blend is easy for beginners to use without streaking or uneven patches, and although the tan is instant, the fade is nice and gradual. Promising review: “If you use St. Tropez tan products or any fake tanner, do yourself a favor and try this. This stuff is AWESOME. Dries quickly, lasts longer, does NOT make your skin stinky, applies evenly, and you get a fair amount of product!! Other tanners I've used become VERY noticeable when they start fading. Gross hand lines, patchy white spots, etc., but not this stuff. The best one-hour tan I have ever used!” —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $9.97 (available in 16 styles)...."
1m45eit,2025-07-19 19:55:00,en,REDDIT,"  Okay, beauty lovers — storytime because this one's a journey. So I've been super tanned lately (hello, summer ☀️) and my usual holy grail Charlotte Tilbury powder just isn't cutting it shade-wise right now. Guerlain isn't even on Sephora here yet (why do they do us like this? 😩) , so I thought, “Let's try something new!” and picked up the Saie translucent powder. At first, it looked cute… lightweight, natural, all the things. But then — days later — out of nowhere… breakouts. And not just the occasional bump, but itchy, irritated little spots that had me questioning my whole life. I never break out from powders, so this was a shock. Bless Sephora's return policy and the sweetest SAs ever. They saw the situation and immediately recommended Make Up For Ever to help cover what Saie left behind lol. Just tried it and fingers crossed my skin behaves this time. The moral of the story? Not every “clean girl” powder is gonna love you back — but there's always a return counter and a new product to try. ♀"

mov_C6BC05C5A05E2D13A12D7E58D6B4C2E5,2025-07-20 07:09:53,en,WEB,"  Now I have so much more room in my suitcase. As a travel editor, I'm always eagerly trying to plan my next trip so I can test new gear and debunk viral hacks. The biggest packing lesson I've learned in my decade of travel? Never underestimate your toiletry bag. This became abundantly clear on my last trip to London, when my poorly packed toiletry bag single-handedly ruined my experience abroad. I'd foolishly stuffed and stashed as many toiletries, skincare jars, and makeup products as I could into my small bag, which subsequently ripped mid-way through the trip from the constant tugging, squishing, and pushing it endured with every use. In addition to leaky toiletries and hogging precious luggage space, the overstuffed toiletry bag also got me flagged on my return flight to New York. Since it exceeded England's liquid carry-on limit, I had to exit the security line and toss $200 worth of beloved products from Charlotte Tilbury, Armani Beauty, and other pricey brands, resulting in a mad dash through the security line and the airport to make it to my gate. Now, you won't catch me holding up TSA or wrestling with a toiletry bag that's bursting at the seams, and it's all thanks to these genius packing tips. Keep scrolling to find out which products you need to hack your toiletry bag. Related: I'm a Pro Packer, and I Still Use These 12 Old-school Tricks to Fit Everything in a Carry-on Best Toiletry Bag Travel Essentials Hack: Upgrade your toiletry bag These tips are useless if you don't have the proper toiletry bag. When I went abroad, I was toting around a bulky pouch with no pockets or organizational features that quickly took up room in my carry-on. Now, I travel with the Béis Dopp Kit, which includes a space-doubling zippered compartment and plenty of thoughtful slip pockets to keep everything organized and compactly stored. Over at Amazon, travelers have a great deal of toiletry bags and Dopp kits to choose from. If you're prone to overpacking, I recommend starting with the Eachy toiletry bag, while the Bagsmart Dopp Kit is great for weekend trips and long vacations that require shampoo, conditioner, and other toiletries. Recently, I learned that compression packing cubes also make suitable toiletry bags. Try the smallest compression cube from Bagail's top-rated set; you can suck the air out of it to free up extra space in your personal item or carry-on. Hack: Put everything in a travel bottle Even if your go-to toiletry or skincare product comes in a tiny package, you still want to transfer it to a travel bottle. This way, you're only bringing what you need and definitely staying within the carry-on liquid requirements. Plus, they're made for travel, so you don't have to worry about anything leaking, breaking, or awkwardly fitting in your toiletry bag. Over at Amazon, you can score all-in-one value sets, like the MrsDry eight-pack set and Morfone 16-piece set that comes with travel-sized jars for lotion, moisturizer, and hair creams, or the 18-piece Tocelffe set that includes tiny jars for liquid foundation, concealer, and more if you're tight on space. Whenever I go on a weekend trip, I use my Depoza travel bottle set, which I love for the travel-sized sprayer that fits my Rôz Air Thickening Leave-in Spray and other hair care essentials inside its compact clear bag. Hack: Stock up on travel-sized products When transferring your toiletries and beauty products into travel bottles isn't an option, you'll want to make sure that you've got them ready to go in TSA-approved, travel-sized containers. Luckily, almost every product comes in a travel-friendly mini version (which is great if you've been wanting to try a product but don't want to pay full price). At the top of my travel-sized must-haves is the Ilia Base Face Milk, which adds extra hydration to your skin when you're on the go (whether you're doing your nighttime routine after a long day in the sun or need to get rid of dryness before putting on your makeup). Speaking of hydration, the Epicuren Papaya Pineapple After Bath Body Lotion is another toiletry non-negotiable that happens to be a celeb-loved product (Kim Kardashian is a longtime fan); it hardly takes up any space in your toiletry bag, and it performs way better than the hotel-provided hand and body lotion. Don't forget about the makeup minis: I always keep a tiny bottle of Charlotte Tilbury's Hollywood Flawless Filter in my toiletry bag because, when it's on, I don't need foundation (thus simplifying my packing list). Another pro tip: palettes are your best friends, especially when they come in travel sizes. The Natasha Denona Mini Bronze + Glow palette is like packing three makeup products in one; it covers bronzer, highlight, and eyeshadow if you put a little bit of both products on your eyes. Hack: Utilize your pill organizer Nothing fills up a toiletry bag faster than pill bottles. I usually travel with probiotics, melatonin gummies, and my daily medications—plus Ibuprofen, Benadryl, Dramamine, Pepcid, and other important ""just in case "" medications depending on where I'm traveling. Instead of jamming multiple bottles and jars into my toiletry bag, I opt for the Holli pill organizer for small trips and the Bexeen pill organizer for longer ones (it has eight compartments that are perfect for everything I'd need). Those with routines to follow will want to check out the slim, weekly pill organizer from Vaydeer, and the Fyy Daily Pill Organizer is also great for organizing multiple medicine shapes, sizes, and quantities without taking up too much space. Pro tip: Use the unused compartments in your pill organizer for tiny things like jewelry, Q-tips, cotton rounds, nail clippers, and more, so you don't need another travel case for them. Hack: Downsize your tools Your skincare routine isn't the only part of your packing list that should be downsized. For extra space, I've learned that traveling with mini versions of my go-to tools can help free clutter from my toiletry bag. For example, I always had the tendency to bring my full-sized brush with me on every trip. Now, I bring the mini Emi Jay Boar Bristle Hair Brush (it's compact enough to fit in a toiletry bag or in your carry-on's unsuspecting pockets if you don't have the toiletry bag space). The same goes for my toothbrush; instead of being weighed down by my bulky electric toothbrush and its charging base, I bring the Philips Sonicare Electric Toothbrush that runs on batteries and comes with a small travel case. You can also save space by bringing a mini hair straightener instead of a full-size version. Hack: Simplify your routine The most effective way I've found to stop overpacking my toiletry bag is to simplify my getting-ready routine. This is not easy, especially if you're someone who likes to have a specific product for everything. To ensure that there are no holes in your travel routine, opt for products that multitask. For example, the IT Cosmetics CC+ Cream covers your sunscreen and foundation, so you don't need to pack a separate SPF and coverup. Similarly, you can reduce the products in your hair care routine by packing the R+Co Cool Wind Air Dry Hair Cream, which doubles as a leave-in conditioner and a styling product (you don't even need a hair dryer!)..."
