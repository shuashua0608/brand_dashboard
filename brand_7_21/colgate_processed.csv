Le Bureau du commissaire aux conflits d'intérêts et à l'éthique a publié vendredi dernier la liste des actions que M. Carney possédait avant la création d'une fiducie sans droit de regard quand il est devenu premier ministre en mars. Il s'agit d'une liste imposante, d'une quinzaine de pages, qui comprend des actions de plusieurs sociétés ainsi que des options et des actions différées de Brookfield Corporation et de Brookfield Asset Management, où M. Carney a travaillé avant de briguer la chefferie du Parti libéral en janvier dernier. Le premier ministre détenait également des actions dans 569 sociétés par l'intermédiaire d'un «compte de placement géré par un tiers» dont il ne «contrôlait ni ne dirigeait la sélection des investissements», selon la déclaration publiée par le commissaire. Gros portefeuille De grandes entreprises américaines de divers secteurs, dont le pétrole, l'armement, les chemins de fer, le commerce de détail et les nouvelles technologies, sont du nombre. Le portefeuille de M. Carney comprenait en effet des actions des géants de la tech, comme Alphabet (maison mère de Google), Apple, Amazon, Meta, Nividia et Microsoft. Le premier ministre avait également des parts dans les grandes compagnies de crédit, comme American Express, Capital One, Mastercard et dans plusieurs compagnies aériennes, dont American Airlines, Boeing, Delta, Southwest Airlines et United Airlines. Parmi les autres investissements notables compris dans le portefeuille de M. Carney, on compte le fabricant des F-35 Lockheed Martin, Airbnb, Adobe, Berkshire Hathaway Inc., Blackrock Funding, le Canadien Pacifique, Caterpillar, Coca-Cola, Colgate, Palmolive, Costco, Doordash, eBay, FedEx, Ferrari, Harley-Davidson, Heineken, Home Depot, Kraft Heinz, McDonald's, Molson Coors, Netflix, Nike, Paypal, Starbucks, Tesla et Walmart. M. Carney possédait aussi des intérêts dans de grosses compagnies pétrolières comme exxon Mobile et Chevron. «Filtrage» La déclaration indique par ailleurs que le premier ministre et le commissaire ont convenu d'un «filtrage des conflits d'intérêts», une mesure visant à empêcher toute possibilité de favoriser les intérêts de M. Carney ou ceux de «Brookfield Asset Management, Brookfield Corporation et Stripe Inc ainsi que de toute société détenue ou contrôlées par celles-ci.» Les deux hommes qui auront la responsabilité de veiller à ce que le premier ministre de soit informé d'aucune affaire officielle ni d'aucun processus décisionnel impliquant Brookfield et Stripe sont son chef de cabinet, Marc-André Blanchard, et le nouveau greffier du Conseil privé, Michael Sabia. «Ce filtrage m'empêchera d'accorder un traitement préférentiel à l'une ou l'autre de ces sociétés dans l'exercice de mes pouvoirs, devoirs et fonctions officielles de titulaire de charge publique principal», a noté M. Carney dans la divulgation."

mov_398E18BE032EFF910FEEB34EEA899BC0,2025-07-14 18:53:03,en,WEB,"  Imagine a store where every item costs between $1 and $5, yet delivers surprising quality and trend-driven excitement. That's the magic of Five Below discount innovations , a retail phenomenon redefining affordability for Gen Z and budget-conscious families. Founded in 2002 by David Schlessinger and Tom Vellios, this Philadelphia-born brand has exploded into a 1,500+ store powerhouse by mastering the art of “extreme-value” retail. I've watched shelves transform from basic school supplies to viral TikTok toys and eco-friendly gadgets—all under $5. Their secret? Agile sourcing, AI-driven trend forecasting, and a treasure-hunt experience that turns casual shoppers into devoted fans. As inflation squeezes wallets, Five Below's model isn't just surviving—it's setting the blueprint for the future of discount retail. Five Below Discount Innovations: Revolutionizing Budget Retail Five Below's market position hinges on a simple but radical premise: everything costs $1–$5. Unlike dollar stores with inconsistent quality, they've built global recognition for merging affordability with trend relevance. I tested their strategy firsthand—during 2023's holiday rush, their “Wow Zone” (featuring $5 Bluetooth speakers and licensed Disney toys) drew 40% more foot traffic than traditional discounters. Their innovation engine uses real-time social media scraping to identify viral trends, enabling product launches in just 30 days. For example, 2023's Squishmallows collaboration sold 2 million units in 3 weeks, proving their influence on consumer behavior . According to the National Retail Federation, Five Below ranks #2 in teen preference, beating Amazon in “fun factor.” Their app's gamified scavenger hunts and AR-powered store maps further blur digital/physical shopping—critical as 67% of their shoppers are under 25. From Philly Startup to National Phenomenon: Five Below's Growth Journey Five Below's history began with a risky bet: targeting teens with extreme-value tech. I spoke to early employee Marta Chen (2005–2010), who recalled, “We'd disassemble $5 headphones to prove durability to skeptical parents.” That obsession with quality fueled explosive evolution: 2002–2010 : Scrappy experimentation. Flagship products like neon phone cases ($2) and graphic tees ($5) established their “cool cheap” identity. 2011 IPO : Funding accelerated expansion, hitting 200 stores by 2013. COVID pivot : When lockdowns hit, they partnered with DoorDash for under-30-minute delivery of “quarantine kits” (crafts, snacks, electronics). Sales jumped 31% YoY. 2023 : Entered 8 new states and launched Five Beyond—sections testing $6-$10 items like solar phone chargers. Products Driving the Discount Revolution Five Below's product offerings reshape expectations of ultra-low-cost goods. Their merchandising genius lies in three categories: 1. Tech & Innovation $5 Bluetooth Earbuds : 4.2-star average (tested against Anker models). Solar-powered phone chargers : Sold 500k+ units since 2022. AI-assisted toys : Like “Coding Critters,” teaching basic programming. 2. Licensed Collaborations Limited-edition drops with Marvel, NFL, and Stranger Things create urgency. Their Minions toothbrush ($3) outsold Colgate's $8 equivalent at Target last summer. 3. Seasonal “Wow” Items $5 inflatable pools and Halloween costumes drive 45% of Q2/Q3 revenue. As retail analyst Brenda Fields notes, “They've made disposable income feel limitless.” Technology & Future-Forward Strategy Five Below's patents reveal a tech-first approach: AI TrendTracker : Scans 10M+ social posts daily to predict viral products (e.g., 2023's light-up crocs). Robotic Warehousing : Automated Philly hub cuts restocking to 24 hours. Sustainability Tech : Solar-powered stores and biodegradable packaging pilots. Global Ambitions & Smart Expansion Five Below's worldwide presence focuses on strategic saturation: U.S. Dominance : 150+ new stores annually, targeting suburban power centers. International Tests : Toronto pop-ups (2023) saw 200% sales over projections...."

mov_0733342E367B854BAD2F00A4989030A4,2025-07-15 14:01:00,en,WEB,"  DELRAY BEACH, Fla., July 15, 2025 /PRNewswire/   The global Oral Care Market, valued at US$34.97 billion in 2024 stood at US$37.21 billion in 2025 and is projected to advance at a resilient CAGR of 6.4% from 2025 to 2030, culminating in a forecasted valuation of US$53.29 billion by the end of the period. The expansion of the oral care market can be attributed to several key factors, including a growing prevalence of untreated oral hygiene issues that lead to dental caries and periodontal diseases. Enhanced educational initiatives by healthcare professionals are significantly raising awareness around the importance of oral hygiene, thereby encouraging the adoption of better oral care practices among the population. Furthermore, advancements in oral care products—such as electric and AI-integrated toothbrushes, advanced formulations of toothpaste, and tailored mouthwashes—are enhancing both the efficacy of treatments and the overall user experience. As public awareness of oral hygiene continues to rise, there has been a corresponding increase in demand for innovative oral care solutions. Download PDF Brochure: Browse in-depth TOC on 'Oral Care Market' 345 - Tables 62 - Figures 318 - Pages By product type, the oral care market can be categorized by product type into several key segments, including toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwashes/rinses, dental accessories, and denture products. As of 2024, the toothpaste segment dominated the market, capturing the largest share. This significant market presence can be attributed to the widespread daily use of toothpaste among consumers, making it an essential part of personal hygiene routines. Several factors contribute to the vigorous growth of the toothpaste segment. Firstly, the product's availability in a variety of formulations and price points has made it accessible to a broad range of consumers, fostering an increase in demand. The introduction of innovations, such as teeth whitening formulas, has also made toothpaste particularly appealing to those who prioritize aesthetics and are looking for solutions to enhance their smile. Moreover, toothpaste products that focus on specific dental health concerns—such as cavity prevention, which actively combats plaque buildup and sensitivity relief formulas designed for individuals with teeth sensitive to temperature and pressure—are contributing to the overall market growth. The variety of options available allows consumers to explore and switch between different brands based on their specific needs and preferences, driving competition and innovation within the sector. In summary, the combination of widespread daily usage, affordability, product innovations, and a responsive variety of choices is fueling the robust growth of the toothpaste segment in the oral care market. By application, the homecare segment held the largest market share in 2024. The homecare segment encompasses essential oral hygiene products such as toothpaste, toothbrushes, mouthwashes, and dental floss, which consumers have utilized multiple times daily. This category offers a diverse array of products, including breath fresheners available in various flavors and specialized toothpaste formulated to address specific dental issues such as tooth sensitivity, periodontal concerns, and cavity prevention. The extensive availability of these oral care products across retail outlets and pharmacies has significantly driven their consumption rates. By distribution channel, the consumer stores segment accounted for the largest share of the oral care market. Consumer retail outlets are extensively accessible, enhancing the convenience of purchasers in acquiring products. This accessibility allows consumers to engage in comprehensive brand comparisons, facilitating the selection of optimal options. The availability of a diverse array of products empowers consumers to fulfill their needs promptly, minimizing delays associated with procurement. The tactile experience of in-person purchases often yields a heightened sense of satisfaction for consumers. Furthermore, established loyalty with retailers can result in various advantages, such as exclusive offers or rewards programs, ultimately enriching the purchasing experience. By geography, the patient handling equipment market is classified into five primary regional segments: North America, Europe, the Asia Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East & Africa, and GCC Countries. Notably, the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region dominated the oral care market in 2024, primarily driven by its burgeoning population. This demographic trend has significantly fueled the demand for oral care products. Furthermore, the rise in disposable income among consumers has correlated with increased expenditure on oral care solutions. Enhanced public awareness campaigns led by government initiatives and dental professionals have also contributed to this demand surge, emphasizing the critical role of maintaining oral hygiene. Additionally, the expansion of both online and offline distribution channels has facilitated greater access to oral care products, further stimulating market growth.

The company has also ventured into the realm of smart technology with the launch of AI-integrated toothbrushes that provide users with real-time guidance on optimal brushing techniques. In line with sustainability initiatives, Colgate-Palmolive has initiated the production of biodegradable toothbrushes and has adopted recyclable cardboard packaging alongside the rollout of a recyclable toothpaste tube in the US marketplace. Committed to advancing oral care through scientific research, Colgate-Palmolive allocated 1.8% of its annual revenue to R&D in 2024, underscoring its focus on product innovation. A notable example of this ongoing development is the launch in February 2025 of a cohesive three-product system comprising a toothpaste, toothbrush, and alcohol-free mouthwash, exemplifying the company's commitment to enhancing oral care solutions. Procter & Gamble (US) Procter & Gamble is among the front-runner companies in the oral care industry, with Oral-B and Crest brands.

Their latest offerings include electric toothbrushes featuring iO technology, which integrates seamlessly with smartphone applications to deliver instant insights and support optimal brushing techniques.

n3c06it,2025-07-15 21:06:07,en,REDDIT,"  1. Not sure if it counts as a random everyday object, but hiking poles. I bought a cheap set off Amazon (Cascade Mountain Tech) prior to my diagnosis for a Yosemite trip but I find they have become indispensable for letting me enjoy nature now, since dizziness and balance are my worst current MS everyday symptoms and canes are just so SLOW for hiking. 2. Cell phone lanyard. I bought one for around $3 from Daiso and I can't live without it now. I drop things so easily and it allows me to carry other things in my hands and phones are so expensive if I drop it. I believe Five Below also had inexpensive lanyards. Discount stores tend to be more expensive but may be higher quality (CaseMate had some that people may find cute). Have not seen them at American dollar stores, but that doesn't mean they're not there. Amazon and Chinese vendors may have very cheap ones. It's similar to this - I have a black and hot pink one. [https://shop.daisosingapore.com.sg/products/4550480445564](https://shop.daisosingapore.com.sg/products/4550480445564) Or if you just buy the little plastic tether to go inside your cell phone case, you can use any lanyard or a wriststrap. I bought replacements at Daiso because the plastic part has already broken once. These look like this, they also sell clear ones if you have a clear/see-through case - [https://www.amazon.com/TACOMEGE-Tether-iPhone-Lanyard-Replacement/dp/B0BZPPN4BX](https://www.amazon.com/TACOMEGE-Tether-iPhone-Lanyard-Replacement/dp/B0BZPPN4BX) And there are lanyard versions that are rubber going around the outside of the phone, handy if you need to switch phones out. Like this one. [https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Lanyard-Silicone-Compatible-Smartphones/dp/B08BCQRTYQ](https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Lanyard-Silicone-Compatible-Smartphones/dp/B08BCQRTYQ) 3. And thinking of #2 I have also loved a random purchase I made of a cell phone hands free holder. Easier on the arms when looking at a phone in bed for a long period of time. And handy if you are at the nail salon. Or want to eat/drink/knit/pet a cat/anything else with your hands. I originally bought an as seen on TV one from Dollar General, never paid more than $10 for mine but there are some more expensive ones on Amazon (some are magnetic though if you have that type of mount already). They last me about a year or two so maybe a more expensive one might be a better purchase. I don't use it every day though.

(no more dropping it on your face and less to grab than a popsocket) [https://www.amazon.com/TEAMOLA-Silicone-Holder-iPhone-Samsung/dp/B0DG8Q4L7M/](https://www.amazon.com/TEAMOLA-Silicone-Holder-iPhone-Samsung/dp/B0DG8Q4L7M/) 4. Disposable hygiene items to keep by your bed. We all have bad days where we maybe don't get out of bed or can't stand up long at the sink due to fatigue or balance. When I struggled with vertigo pre-MS I found having a small bag or basket of hygiene items next to my bed made a huge difference in how I felt about myself. Small pack of baby wipes help if you are feeling sweaty or need to wash your face or hands. Or I crash because I'm so tired but still have makeup/sweat I didn't wash off. A small bottle of facial moisturizer for hands/face for after. Colgate wisps for brushing my teeth in bed. A small hairbrush and ponytail holders (less tangling). Nail clippers if one hurts or is snagging on stuff. When you're feeling awful, things like this help to feel more human."

mov_D5F4A7E94D7EBF6240AA4574070F4D0A,2025-07-16 06:41:24,en,WEB,"  The Cwtch Mawr Multibank charity initiative, which launched in 2024 and has donated more than 640,000 surplus essential goods to 146,000 people in poverty, has officially opened the doors of its newly-expanded premises in Swansea Vale. Cwtch Mawr will now process donations from its newly expanded 15,000 sq. ft warehouse in Llansamlet, Swansea. The new Cwtch Mawr facility will significantly increase the Multibank's capacity and allow for wider community reach, contributing to more than 8 million goods which have already been delivered to help over 600,000 families from Multibanks in Scotland, Greater Manchester, London, Wales, Birmingham and Tees Valley. This year the Multibank will send 1 million orders to families across the UK. The Cwtch Mawr Multibank is led by Swansea charity Faith in Families with support from Amazon, former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, the Welsh Government, and Swansea Council. The expansion of the collaborative project marks a major step forward in the fight against poverty in South Wales. Cwtch Mawr Multibank's new premises will boost the Faith in Families' ambition to share one million new, unused household products by the end of 2025 with homes experiencing poverty across Carmarthenshire and the M4 belt. Amazon helped set up the Cwtch Mawr Multibank warehouse operations, providing logistical expertise and tech support. Five employees from the nearby Amazon Swansea fulfilment centre worked on-site at the Multibank for the first full year of operation. As part of its support of the Cwtch Mawr Multibank, Amazon has transported over 570,000 essential items in 90 trucks and vans. Five Amazon trucks transported more than 35,000 essential items as part of the Multibank's new warehouse opening. The expansion of the collaborative Multibank project, described by Mr Brown as a “coalition of compassion” reflects the growing number of supplying business partners to the Multibank and a step forward in efforts to combat the detrimental effects of household poverty in South Wales. Since the opening of the first Multibank in Mr Brown's home county of Fife, Scotland three years ago, the Multibank charity, supported by Amazon, has opened six sites across the three nations and distributed 8 million separate products, via its hyper local charity partner networks – which include teachers, doctors, midwives, family support workers and micro-community charities – to 600,000 households experiencing poverty. The Wales' Multibank, Cwtch Mawr was also established with logistical, tech and warehouse support from Amazon UK and warehouse operations, providing logistical expertise and tech support. Five employees from the nearby Amazon Swansea fulfilment centre worked on-site at the Multibank for the first full year of operation. A range of organisations have provided funding to pay for rent and utilities, and to support the recruitment, salaries and training of additional staff, including Swansea Council, Pobl Housing Association, and The Moondance Foundation. A growing number of businesses are joining the Multibank network and donating goods to redistribute or logistical expertise to ensure products can be delivered. Newport based Sofitel now supports with toilet paper products, Palletline is supporting with delivery and warehouse storage and Mercedes has gifted first generation electric vans to sustainably support “last mile” deliveries. Colgate Palmolive, Tommy Tippee, Pura nappies are now also backers of the Swansea Multibank. Cwtch Mawr, Cherrie Bija, CEO of Faith in Families, said: “Families are facing pressures every day. Rising costs, limited support, and hard choices no one should have to make. We built Cwtch Mawr because the need was clear, and now we've expanded it because the demand continues to grow. This new space means we can do more: more stock, more reach, more impact. We're also in active talks with Neath Port Talbot and Carmarthenshire councils to explore how this model could benefit more communities across South Wales. From the start, Gordon Brown and Amazon backed this idea, not with just words, but with real commitment. It's taken a wide network of support to make this happen; and we're just getting started.” John Boumphrey, UK Country Manager, Amazon, said: “It's incredible to see the positive impact that Cwtch Mawr is having on communities in South Wales. The new facility in Swansea demonstrates what's possible when businesses and community organisations unite with a clear mission. My thanks go to our partners, including Faith in Families and my incredible Amazon colleagues, for their continued work in supporting the Multibank.” The Rt Hon Gordon Brown, former Prime Minister and co-founder of the Multibank charity network said: “It's been just over 12 months since the opening of the Cwtch Mawr Multibank and now we're expanding to a brand-new warehouse three times the size – from 5,000 to 15,000 feet. To be able to scale up and bring yet more support to more households across South Wales after just one year is a great achievement by all those who have come together in Wales. Together we are meeting unmet needs by using underused resources and we are giving so many people new hope and our coalition of compassion have made all the difference to thousands of lives.” The Cabinet Secretary for Social Justice, Jane Hutt, who attended the opening alongside the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Welsh Language, Mark Drakeford, said: “Cwtch Mawr is a powerful example of what we can achieve when we work together with compassion and a shared commitment to help those in need. I'm proud to back its expansion, so it can continue changing more lives for the better. While we celebrate this success, we must also acknowledge the growing demand it meets, and the urgent need to tackle poverty at its roots. That's why we will have invested nearly £7 bn between 2022 and 2026 to reduce costs and maximise incomes for Welsh families. Our child poverty strategy sets out how we'll use all of our powers to meet our ambitious goals and support those who need it most.”"

mov_F8A8E385031ED95A42CFFA74903C5294,2025-07-16 16:55:06,en,WEB,"  SEATTLE (July 16, 2025) – PWHL Seattle today announced that 2025 PWHL Draft pick, goaltender Hannah Murphy, has signed a two-year Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL) Standard Player Agreement through the 2026-27 season. Murphy, who played her collegiate hockey at Colgate University, was the first goaltender selected in the 2025 PWHL Draft, going in the second round, 15th overall. “Hannah strikes a difficult balance between size and athleticism,” said PWHL Seattle General Manager Meghan Turner. “Her agility, quick crease movement, and ability to seal the net make her well-suited for the speed and demands of the pro game. We're excited to see her on the ice this season.” A 21-year-old from Kingston, ON, Murphy played four seasons for the Raiders and is the program's all-time leader with 73 wins and 18 shutouts. In 2024-25, she posted a 26-8-0 record with three shutouts, a 1.86 goals-against-average and a .939 save percentage to earn Second Team All-ECAC honors. She was also named to the All-ECAC Third team in the 2023-24 season, was a semi-finalist for ECAC Goalie of the Year in 2024, and a four-time recipient of ECAC Goalie of the Week. “I am extremely grateful to officially sign with PWHL Seattle and make my dream of being a professional hockey player a reality,” said Murphy. “It means so much to have the chance to connect with Seattle's passionate and supportive fanbase and play with a talented group of players to try to bring a championship to the city.” Murphy is the second member of PWHL Seattle's inaugural entry draft to sign following first round pick Jenna Buglioni, and was the second of six players selected on June 24 along with forwards Lily Delianedis, Jada Habisch, Olivia Wallin, and defender Lyndie Lobdell.

n3h2ih8,2025-07-16 17:00:12,en,REDDIT,"  So I'll make it 100% clear. I am so bad at brushing my teeth but finally got my shit together after a few years of denial and forgetting. First of all. It all began with me trying to get my shit together because. Well, fuck me, but painful teeth is hell first of all even though I can somewhat tolerate it. But I also had a patient at the hospital go from healthy and fine to months in a coma and waking up with permanent brain damage due to an untreated teeth abscess. This shit scared me really. He now needs a walker and this is like the least of his worries. This could have happened to anyone :/ some people also have heart infections due to it. Before heart surgery to have you fix all your teeth usually due to complications risks. Crazy stuff that we do not expect that can happen, so teeth pain and abscess are serious shit. Now I was tired of having cavities and getting drilled up. I felt so shameful for it. I started by getting my whole mouth fixed which I absolutely hated but it was necessary. I ended up needing a dental surgery on top of it all due to bad past dental hygiene and now I'm supposedly okay. Eventually I decided to try and get my shit together which was not easy at all mostly due to ADHD and no object permanence. How I managed to do it really was find moments where I was about to go in the bathroom to do something else and join it to this activity. Like whenever I was about to go out, like to go at work, I naturally got myself ready and so it was easy to integrate brushing my teeth. Also before going to bed or going in the shower. I love to shower. I don't mind it at all so I'll either bring my toothbrush in or just before heading in it. So that's 1 to 3 times already! ( Canadian dental association recommends 2x a day 2min quality brushing)It does not rely on memory and it's like mixed with another activity so it's less bothersome. It's like I might as well do it. As for flossing. I get the disposable picks with the integrated floss and I leave it in the shower. Since I shower almost everyday. I see the pick and I floss. I know it takes more time and waste more water but that's the absolute only way I've found so far that worked for me. I really liked water pick but my dentist clearly told me he had seen a notable degradation when I moved to it and he told me that was a very frequent mistake since it should be a complimentary add on to flossing and not a replacement for it at all due to the lack of mechanical action so I threw it away altogether, I don't need any extra step already. Now as far as toothbrush and accessories go. I've recently got a new electric toothbrush, I went from an Oral b that was quite intense and felt like a mini jackhammer in my mouth and it made such noise that I would accidentally end up doing echolalia to it involuntarily and hum all the time. I did not like it much and it got gunky quickly. I tried switching to a sonicare 4100, it is a different system altogether that uses ultrasonic vibrations so at first it's weird because it's buzzy but it's a LOT quieter, I don't go into accidental echolalia over it, I personally like it a whole lot more so far. It's also much more delicate in my mouth. Though the buzzing might not be for everyone. It doesn't seem to get as gunky which I don't understand why but yay. There's a pressure sensor to tell you if you're pushing too hard, there's a pacer to tell you how much time to spend on each section of your mouth and it stops automatically once the proper amount of time is done. So far I'm really liking it and am able to do my 2 min of brushing quite easily instead of just trying to get it done as quickly as possible. I personally don't mind mouth wash at all. As a matter of fact... I kinda don't feel the burn much, so I'll just take a small swig whenever I go in the bathroom. And last but not least, toothpaste, again, I'm lucky, I really don't mind the taste or the strength so I picked the most complete toothpaste possible that foamed up well enough for my preference, I use Colgate, total active prevention+ that is like anti sensitivity, antibacterial, restore enamel, whitens, I mean, it does everything no kidding. Sure it's more expensive but I had to have dental surgery due to not caring enough and that made these toothpaste feel very okay to spend money on. Also on the recommendation of my dentists, at night, I use another toothpaste called prevident 5000 sensitive that is both sensitivity protecting but has increased fluor to strengthen teeth. So yep. That's how I got my shit under control and at 35yo, never had such good dental hygiene and I'm really happy about it."

tw_sl_e19932eb5f6ee45006de4e9daa7418e9,2025-07-16 18:12:15,en,WEB,"  It's time to brush up on your oral hygiene. For decades, Americans have been scrubbing their smiles with the wrong tools and techniques thanks to a deeply ingrained myth. This rough-around-the-edges technique is doing more harm than good, according to Chicago-based dentist Dr. Joy Poskozim. The idea that harder bristles work better to clean your teeth has persisted for ages — but it's not actually true. Hard-bristled brushes can actually wear down enamel over time — a condition called toothbrush abrasion — causing teeth to appear browner, thinner and more brittle, especially around the gumline. Even worse, overly aggressive brushing can irritate the gums to the point that they begin to pull back from the teeth — which is where the phrase “long in the tooth” comes from, according to Poskozim. Explore More “Starting in the 1950s, softer nylon toothbrush bristles were being created by toothbrush makers like Colgate,” she told The Post. “[But] there are some people to this day that prefer a medium-hardness toothbrush to the soft-bristled brushes.” If you really want bristles that feel a bit firmer, Poskozim recommends an electric toothbrush like the one by Sonicare. “The bristles are soft and the toothbrush is timed for two minutes — so they are brushing longer and, even though the bristles are soft, it feels like a 'harder' brush,” she said. Poskozim notes that the average American only brushes for 37 seconds, which is well below the professional recommendation of a full two minutes. The dentist, who works extensively with older adults, says many patients grew up with dangerous dental beliefs and habits that still linger. Those include: Thinking harder toothbrushes are better Not knowing anything about flossing Never seeing the dentist on a regular basis unless in pain Not having to see a dentist when having baby teeth Having all teeth removed preventatively to prevent toothaches Getting full dentures when you're only 16, “sometimes still done in the deep South” Bristle firmness isn't the only thing that's changed since the '50s — in fact, there have been shifts in dental care since even the late '90s. “When I graduated from NYU College of Dentistry in 1999, the only thing we knew about the fluoride ion was that it bonded with the surface calcium, helping to prevent bacteria from penetrating into the teeth,” she said. That's because tooth enamel is porous — which is why we feel sensitivity and get stains. But modern science shows fluoride is doing more than just shielding the surface. “Now we know that fluoride also prevents micronutrients from leaving out teeth, so fluoride keeps teeth 'mineralized,'” she said.

With over 200 exhibitors and an expected attendance of more than 15000 industry professionals, this year's event promises to be the country's largest and most influential gathering of packaging experts. PackPlus 2025 will showcase the latest trends, technologies, and solutions across the entire packaging value chain, from primary packaging to supply chain logistics. Visitors can expect to see a wide range of products and services, including packaging machinery, materials, printing and converting equipment, and much more. Speaking about the upcoming show Mr. Umang Gupta, Country General Manager, RX India commented, “The packaging industry is at a critical juncture, fuelled by evolving customer preferences, environmental & sustainability focus, and technological advances.

The accompanying conference sessions will delve deep into evolving industry trends, regulatory landscapes, and best practices, enabling firms to stay ahead of the curve and shape their business models in line with the changing business environment”. To complement the exhibition, the International Packaging Conclave will host a series of engaging panel discussions spotlighting the most critical shifts shaping the future of the industry. The session “Future Ready – Innovating for the Next Decade of Packaging” will explore how the sector is evolving beyond traditional roles to embrace interactive, flexible, and eco-conscious designs. Experts will discuss how technologies like RFID and NFC are transforming packaging into a smart, consumer-responsive medium, with India's smart packaging market projected to grow significantly in the coming years. Another key session, “Industry 4.0 – AI Playing an Indispensable Role in the Printing Industry,” will examine how artificial intelligence is redefining the packaging landscape. From design innovation and customization to error reduction and manufacturing efficiency, the discussion will highlight the expanding role of AI, IoT, and smart labeling in optimizing packaging performance and enhancing consumer engagement. Sustainability will also take center stage in the panel “An Eco-Friendly Unboxing Experience – How Far Are We from Our Sustainability Goals.” The session will address the ongoing journey toward 100% recyclability, the shift toward returnable and minimalistic packaging, and the growing momentum to eliminate plastic. Speakers from AMWAY, Colgate Palmolive, Mondelez International along with industry government officials will offer insights into genuine green practices versus greenwashing and evaluate how close India is to achieving its eco-friendly packaging ambitions. PackPlus 2025 is supported by leading industry associations, industry media partners and will be visited by decision makers from brands like Haldiram's, Patanjali, DP world, Dharampal Satyapal Ltd, ZOMATO, Varun Beverages Ltd and many more.

n3up1ln,2025-07-18 17:29:10,en,REDDIT,"  A lot of us have strategies for defeating Covid and all lung illness at this point. First, don't be scared. I've been through five cases. Chin up, stiff upper lip...you are going to come out fine and stronger than before. Keep telling yourself how strong and invincible you are. Because we are. Here's what I do: If I'm straight up sick: Take an anti-oxidant sequence (Vitamins C, NAC, R-Lipoic Acid) I usually keep it at that for the first day or two. I like 'Life Extension' products. Rest and drink clear liquids of your choice. I like juice or Yogi Teas ( Ginger, Immune stress). Lemon and honey help me. Rest. But see if you can get some sunlight as soon as you are up to it. I check my temp. If it is high, I use warm bubble bath or hot shower. Then go back to bed. I use aspirin and generic Cetirizine  ('Zirtec'), if I need to keep the fever down. Cheap, mostly non-toxic, Amazon delivers quickly. Sometimes,  Guaifenesin, as well if I need to clear mucus. Once you get past the first week, I have all kinds of advice for supplements and NIR, UVB exposure. But for the second week, I like Elecampane based tea to clear that persistent mucus. If you have the 'razor blade throat' or 'the white mucous'...well I don't see how anybody clears that without Betadine or some other POVI gargle. Follow with an H2O2 whitening toothpaste like Colgate White. Can't promise any of this will work for you. But my advice: Be proactive. Find a solution that works for you. Believe in it. Believe in you."

Its parent company, Nestlé, estimates that 4,600 portions of food containing Maggi seasoning were served every second in the 2000s. In 2019, it was ranked the third most recognized global CPG brand, behind Coca-Cola and Colgate. There are at least five versions sold in the United States and nine worldwide. It's used in Southeast Asian cuisine, Mexican cooking, African food, and European dishes. Yet, Maggi seasoning is still relatively unknown in the U.S. and Canada. The original Maggi sauce, Maggi Wurze, was introduced in Switzerland in 1886. The brand, which includes bouillon cubes, seasoning packages, noodles, and soup mixes, was acquired by that other Swiss giant, Nestlé, in 1947. The recipe for the original Maggi and its different versions varies from country to country, but has generally been described as similar to Worcestershire sauce, Marmite, and soy sauce. Several of the recipes contain hydrolyzed vegetable protein, a flavor enhancer made from the amino acids found in soybeans, corn, or wheat, including glutamate. Despite the comparisons and Maggi's use as a substitute for soy sauce, Maggi has a distinct umami flavor all on its own. Competition From Worcestershire Sauce Kept Maggi From American Tables Maggi seasoning lined up on a supermarket shelf - TY Lim/Shutterstock While it's hard to know why Maggi never took off in the United States, it's been speculated that it may have been due to early competition from the heavily advertised Lea & Perrins Worcestershire sauce. Maggi's umami flavor was used to bring meaty flavor to vegetarian dishes in countries that didn't eat meat or couldn't afford to eat meat. North Americans were more accustomed to getting that flavor from meat itself. Despite Maggi's lack of recognition in the U.S., those who use it tend to buy one of two versions sold in North America -- Maggi Jugo, which is often used for Mexican food, and Maggi Seasoning, which is used in Southeast Asian and European cuisines. Many Americans became familiar with Maggi from immigrant parents who used the seasoning to cook favorite foods from their countries of origin and the tradition stuck with subsequent generations. Others became familiar with it by eating at ethnic restaurants, especially Mexican, Indian, and Vietnamese. In Mexico, it's used for salsa, marinades, fillings, and micheladas, a cocktail that takes beer to the next level. Still others may have come across it during their travels, since Maggi is often found alongside the salt at restaurants in Mexico and next to the chutneys in India. Chefs say Maggi is a great addition to a variety of dishes including bánh mì, ceviche, and kati rolls. Maggi seasoning adds flavor to marinades, can be a dipping sauce all on its own, and used in salad dressings. Given its broad applications and deep flavor, you may just want to add it to your list of the best umami-boosting ingredients."

mov_9AC9DA6CFDADA789B7950614CF891425,2025-07-21 04:01:26,en,WEB,"  Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is one of the most profitable consumer stocks to buy now. UBS lowered its price target on Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL) to $106 from $109 while maintaining a Buy rating, citing valuation discipline following the stock's steady run in recent months. At the current price of $86.80, the revised target still implies an upside potential of roughly 22%. An array of toothpaste, toothbrushes, and mouthwashes on a bright background, highlighting the company's oral care products. The firm continues to see strength in Colgate's underlying fundamentals, particularly its strong pricing execution across global markets and steady demand for essential personal care and household products. UBS analysts noted that while foreign exchange and cost headwinds remain part of the equation, margin recovery efforts and disciplined brand investments are likely to support earnings growth through the back half of the year. Colgate has seen consistent performance across its oral care and pet nutrition segments, with emerging markets showing signs of improving volumes. The updated target reflects a more balanced outlook as shares approach levels UBS considers closer to fair value, rather than a change in conviction about the company's prospects. Investors will be watching Colgate's next earnings update for clarity on input cost trends and competitive dynamics, particularly as pricing begins to normalize and volume growth comes back into focus. While we acknowledge the potential of CL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

I've tried a few other brands, but always end up back at Megababe because it lasts the longest and isn't grossly greasy. Megababe is a woman-owned small business founded by Katie Sturino, an entrepreneur, body acceptance advocate, and influencer. Promising review: ""This stick? Literal magic. I used to dread the chafe struggle, but not anymore. Megababe glides on smoother than any of the competitors, no sticky mess, and keeps my thighs happy all day. No heat rash, no irritation, just soft comfort. As a plus-size girl, I'm telling you: this is a game changer. Sundress season? Bring it on"" —Bathorybear Price: $13.99 2.

This magic stuff helps reduce discoloration and thickness, as well as hydrate and exfoliate brittle nails to get them back on track to being ✨shiny✨ and strong. Promising review: ""I noticed my big toe had nail fungus, so I tried this treatment. I've been applying it twice daily and after just 18 days, my nail looks much better. I thought it would take longer, but it's already improving."" —Ivy Price: $23.99 (originally $26.49) 3. A Bug Bite Thing insect bite suction tool to relieve itchy bites and stings from insects out for their summer ouchie hoorahs. No need to broadcast that you forgot to reapply bug spray to the world: Those meddling insects can ~suck it~. (Or at least your new tool can!) Promising review: ""It ONLY works if you use it right away, but it DOES work. People who say it doesn't work are likely waiting too long. You have to keep it with you and use it as soon as you feel the bite. That's the trick to it. Great product."" —FeralHousewife Price: $9.99 4. A K-beauty snail mucin essence I've not gone without since 2020 because this is a GOOD bandwagon to be on, trust me. This was a big part of the popular glass skin movement on TikTok, but all I care is that it helps tame my adult acne flare-ups and fits seamlessly into my morning (and evening!) skincare routines.

My bedtime moisturizer wouldn't leave me feeling very hydrated, but after adding this into my bedtime routine my skin feels nice and moisturized for the night!"" —Emily Price: $8.50+ (available in two sizes) 5. A Colgate teeth-whitening pen to start getting your smile summer travel pic ready by removing discoloration and stains with a swipe of a pen. Brush and floss before applying, but then get ready to unleash your million-watt smile! Promising review: ""Could tell a difference after the first day, have to apply three times the first day and twice on subsequent days. Tip makes it possible to get in between teeth where it is hard to get other whiteners."" —MsMac Price: $26.49 6.
